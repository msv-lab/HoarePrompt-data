According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is \(n * 2\), `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, and `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`. Given that `i` is currently \(n * 2\), for the loop to continue, \(n * 2\) must be less than `t`. Since `t` is fixed, `n` can be incremented by 1 to make `i` equal to \((n + 1) * 2\). Therefore, \(i\) becomes \(2(n + 1)\).

So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be \(2(n + 1)\).

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`.**
