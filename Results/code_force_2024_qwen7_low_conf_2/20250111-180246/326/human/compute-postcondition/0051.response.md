The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the execution would break out of the context where this statement is used. However, since the initial state and the variables' values are provided without any loops or conditions that would be affected by the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))**
