The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the innermost loop or conditional statement. The states of the variables `t`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, `lst`, `ans_f`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is updated to the original `ans` plus the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing 0 and the updated `ans`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
