The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is `0`) from the list `lst`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is `n * 2`, and given that `n` must be at least 1, the list `lst` must have at least two elements.

Let's denote the initial elements of `lst` as `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. After removing `lst[0]`, the list becomes `lst = [lst[1]]`.

- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is double the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, which is now only dependent on `lst[1]`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it must be at least 1.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is the string input by the user.
- `lst` is updated to `[lst[1]]`.
- `ans_f` remains unchanged as it contains `0` and `ans`.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is `n * 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is double the minimum of `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list containing a single element `lst[1]`, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`.**
