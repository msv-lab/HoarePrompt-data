The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly within its definition. Instead, it implies that the parameters are provided through some external context or are predefined before the function call. The functionality described involves processing test cases and specific integers, but the function itself does not take any parameters.

Given the constraints and the implied nature of the function, we can describe its functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, along with 2n positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function returns based on the given conditions and integers.**
