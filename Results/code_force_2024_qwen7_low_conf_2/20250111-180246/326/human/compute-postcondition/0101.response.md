Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of subsequent test cases to process, followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and 2n positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, the function reads these integers, splits them into pairs, and calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair until the list of integers is reduced to 2 or fewer elements. This process is repeated for each test case, and the results are stored in a list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the list `ans_f` containing the sums of the minimum values for each test case.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the input list `lst` has less than 2 elements at any point, the function still tries to remove elements, which could lead to errors. However, the current code handles this by breaking the loop when `len(lst) == 2`, preventing any potential errors.
- The function assumes that the input list `lst` always contains exactly 2n integers. If this assumption is violated (e.g., incorrect input format), the function might not behave as expected. To handle such cases, additional validation checks could be added to ensure the input format is correct before processing.
- The function does not handle non-integer inputs for `t`, `n`, or the individual elements of `lst`. Adding input validation would ensure robustness.
