Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing 0 and the final `ans`, `i` is `n * 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop did not execute due to the condition `len(lst) == 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs up to `n * 2` times. Each time, if the length of `lst` is not 2, the minimum of the first two elements is added to `ans` and the first two elements are removed from `lst`.
- If the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less before the loop reaches `n * 2` iterations, the loop breaks and no further operations are performed on `lst`.
- Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be the sum of the minimum values of each pair of elements processed until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements.
- The variable `i` will be `n * 2 + k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop did not execute due to the condition `len(lst) == 2`.

This covers all possible scenarios, whether the loop completes all iterations or breaks early based on the condition.
