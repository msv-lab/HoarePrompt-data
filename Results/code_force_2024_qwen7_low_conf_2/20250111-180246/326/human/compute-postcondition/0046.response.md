To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze the conditions step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is \(2(n + 1)\)
- `n` is an integer input by the user
- `l` is a string input by the user
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces
- `ans_f` is a list containing `0`

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < n * 2`.

### Loop Body Analysis:
We need to consider what happens inside the loop, but since the loop body is omitted, we focus on how the loop condition changes and how it impacts the variables.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - At the start of the loop, `i` is set to \(2(n + 1)\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as \(i < n \times 2\).

3. **Incrementing `i`:**
   - Each iteration of the loop increases `i` by 1.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 each time, the new value of `i` after one more iteration will be \(2(n + 1) + 1\).

5. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, \(2(n + 1) + 1\) must still be less than \(n \times 2\).
   - Simplifying this, we get \(2n + 3 < 2n\), which is not possible for any integer \(n\).

Since \(2(n + 1) + 1 = 2n + 3\) is always greater than \(2n\) for any integer \(n\), the loop cannot execute another iteration based on the given initial value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the loop cannot execute another iteration due to the fixed initial value of `i` being \(2(n + 1)\), no adjustments are needed for the states if we strictly follow the loop condition.

However, if the problem implies a hypothetical or different context where the loop could potentially execute, we would need additional information about how `i` might change or if there are other conditions affecting the loop execution.

### Final State (Hypothetical Execution):
If we were to adjust the states hypothetically for the loop to execute one more time, it would be:

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`.**

But based on the current logic and the given initial value of `i`, the loop cannot execute another iteration.
