The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum of the first two elements in the list `lst`, both converted to integers. Let's break this down:

1. `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
2. The first element of `lst` is `lst[0]` and the second element is `lst[1]`.
3. Both `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are converted to integers using `int()`.
4. The minimum of these two integers is added to `ans`.

Since the initial state of `total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\) (where `n` is an integer input by the user), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, we need to focus on the variables `ans_f`, `lst`, and the operation on `ans`.

- `ans_f` remains unchanged as it was initialized as `[0]`.
- `lst` remains unchanged as its contents are determined by the string `l` which hasn't been modified.
- `ans` is updated by adding the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans_f[0]` plus the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`.**
