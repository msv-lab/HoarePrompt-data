According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `ans_f`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f`, `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, and `i` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the bounds of `ans_f` and `ans_f` must contain at least one element. Since `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f` at the end of the last iteration, the only condition that needs to be maintained is that `ans_f` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f`, `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, and `i` is printed.**
