Let's go through the steps:

1. Initial State:
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\)
   - `l` is a string input by the user (unknown value)
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `0`
   - `ans` is the initial value of `ans_f[0]` plus the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`

2. Code Execution:
   - `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is index 0) from the list `lst`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - The value of `total` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged because it was calculated using an unknown value `n` which is not involved in the current operation.
   - The value of `l` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `lst` changes. Initially, `lst` was a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and now it has its first element removed.

4. Updated Values:
   - Since `ans_f` only contains `0`, removing an element from `lst` does not affect `ans_f` or `ans`.
   - The value of `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\) where `n` is unknown.
   - The value of `l` is still a string input by the user.
   - The value of `lst` is the original list with the first element removed.
   - The value of `ans` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the operation.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `ans` is the initial value of `ans_f[0]` plus the minimum of the first two integers in the modified `lst`.**
