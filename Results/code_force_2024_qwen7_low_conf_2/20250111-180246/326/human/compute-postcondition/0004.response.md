The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. However, since no specific input value is provided, the exact value of `n` remains unknown. The variable `ans` remains unchanged and is still equal to 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer**
