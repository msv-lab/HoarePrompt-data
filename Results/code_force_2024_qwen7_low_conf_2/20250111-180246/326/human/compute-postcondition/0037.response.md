Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - `i` is \(2(n + 1)\).
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `0`.
   - `l` is a string input by the user.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n * 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analyzing the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n * 2`.
   - The initial value of `i` is given as \(2(n + 1)\).

4. **Determining the Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.
   - Given `i = 2(n + 1)`, we need to check if `2(n + 1) < n * 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Condition:**
   - Simplify the inequality:
     \[
     2(n + 1) < 2n
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2n + 2 < 2n
     \]
   - Subtract \(2n\) from both sides:
     \[
     2 < 0
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The inequality \(2 < 0\) is always false, meaning the initial value of `i` (`2(n + 1)`) is never less than `n * 2` for any valid `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute under the given initial conditions.

Given this analysis, the loop cannot execute based on the current state. However, if we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute, we would need to change the initial value of `i` such that it satisfies the condition `2(n + 1) < n * 2`.

Since the problem asks for the state adjustments needed, and based on the current logic, no adjustment to `i` or other variables will make the loop execute under the given constraints.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `l` is a string input by the user. The loop cannot execute under the given initial conditions.**
