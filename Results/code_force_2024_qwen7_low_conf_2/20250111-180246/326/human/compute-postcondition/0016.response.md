Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `lst` is a list of either two or one element (depending on the if condition).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n * 2 - 1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n * 2`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was less than `n * 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n * 2`.

Given that `i` was less than `n * 2` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

So, `i` will become `i + 1`.

Since `i` was previously less than `n * 2`, it will now be equal to the current value of `i` plus 1. To ensure the loop continues, this new value of `i` must still be less than `n * 2`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is now \(i + 1\) and that it is still less than `n * 2`.

**State:**
- `t` remains the same: an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` remains the same: the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.
- `n` remains the same: a non-negative integer.
- `lst` remains the same: a list of either two or one element based on the conditions described.

However, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

**Final State:**
- `i` is now \(i + 1\).
- `i` must still be less than `n * 2`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(i + 1\). `lst` is a list of either two or one element (depending on the if condition) and `i` must be less than `n * 2`.**
