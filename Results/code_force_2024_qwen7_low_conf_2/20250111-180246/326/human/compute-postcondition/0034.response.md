The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. This means that the value of `n` is now an integer input by the user, while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2(n + 1)\); `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions; `ans_f` is a list containing `0`.**
