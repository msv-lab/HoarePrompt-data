The code updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` is already defined as the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. After executing the line of code, `ans` will now be doubled since it adds itself to its current value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is double the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`**
