Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `i` is \(2(n + 1)\).
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
- `ans_f` is a list containing `0`.
- `l` is a string input by the user.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop runs for `2 * n` iterations. In each iteration, it checks the length of `lst`:
- If the length of `lst` is not 2, it removes the first and the third elements (if exists) from `lst` and updates `ans` with the minimum of the first two elements of `lst`.
- If the length of `lst` is 2, it updates `ans` with the minimum of the first two elements and breaks out of the loop.

### Observations from Example Output States
- After 1 iteration: `ans` is updated to include the minimum of the first two elements.
- After 2 iterations: `ans` is updated to include the minimum of the next pair of elements, and `lst` might have its third element removed.
- After 3 iterations: `ans` is updated to include the minimum of the next pair of elements, and `lst` might have more elements removed.

### Final State Determination
After `2 * n` iterations, the loop will have processed all possible pairs (or the last remaining element) in `lst` based on the conditions provided. Let's summarize the final state:

- `t` remains unchanged as it was used to initialize `ans` but is not modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is an input value and not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is set to `2(n + 1)` before the loop starts and does not change during the loop.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is the input string and not modified within the loop.
- `lst` will either be empty or contain the last remaining element (if any) after processing all pairs. If `lst` is empty, `ans` will be the sum of `t` and the minimum values calculated from all pairs.
- `ans` will be the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs (or the last remaining element) processed by the loop.

### Output State
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, `n` is the integer input by the user, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and `ans_f` is a list containing `0`.**
