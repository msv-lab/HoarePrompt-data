The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. The value of `ans` itself does not change; only `ans_f` is updated. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing 0 and the current value of `ans`, `i` is `n * 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop did not execute due to the condition `len(lst) == 2`.**
