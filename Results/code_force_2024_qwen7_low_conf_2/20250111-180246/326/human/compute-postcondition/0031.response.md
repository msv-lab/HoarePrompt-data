The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `ans_f` or its initial contents, so we can only say that `ans_f` now contains `ans`.

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` remains the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- `i` remains \(n * 2\).
- `lst` remains a list of integers obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions.

Since the initial state of `ans_f` is not specified, we can only indicate that it now includes the current value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is \(n * 2\), `lst` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans_f` is a list containing `ans`.**
