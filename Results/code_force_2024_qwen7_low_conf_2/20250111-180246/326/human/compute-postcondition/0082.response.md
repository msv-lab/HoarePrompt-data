Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is updated to the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the original `ans` (if the length of `lst` is 2), or double the minimum of `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1])` (if the length of `lst` is not 2), `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and the updated `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`.***
