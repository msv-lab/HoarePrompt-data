The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2n + 3\); `l` is a string input by the user; `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.**
