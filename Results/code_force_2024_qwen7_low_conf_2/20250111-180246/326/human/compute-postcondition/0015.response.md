Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `lst` is a list of either two or one element (depending on the if condition) obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If `len(lst)` is not 2, `lst` has the third element removed. Otherwise, `lst` remains as a list of two elements and `ans` is updated to `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.***
