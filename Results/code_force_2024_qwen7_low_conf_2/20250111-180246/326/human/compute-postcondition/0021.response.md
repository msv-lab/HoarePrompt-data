The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it does not affect any variables and simply exits the loop or conditional block. The initial values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(i + 1\). `lst` is a list of either two or one element (depending on the if condition). We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
