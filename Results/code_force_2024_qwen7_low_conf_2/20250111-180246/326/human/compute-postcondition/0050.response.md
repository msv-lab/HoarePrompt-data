`ans` is assigned the value of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. Here, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and `l` is a string input by the user. Therefore, `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are the first and second elements of this list, which are converted to integers before finding the minimum. The value of `ans` is updated by adding this minimum value to its current value, which was initially part of the list `ans_f`.

Since `total` is 10 and `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), these values remain unchanged. `l` is a string input by the user, and `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, and now `ans` is added to `ans_f`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**
