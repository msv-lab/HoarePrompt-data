The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` (both converted to integers). The initial state is as follows: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `lst` is a list of two elements obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.

The code snippet updates `ans` to be the current value of `ans` plus the minimum of the two integers in `lst`. Since the exact values of `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` are not given, we represent them as `a` and `b` respectively, where both `a` and `b` are integers. Thus, `ans` becomes `min(a, b)`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `lst` is a list of two elements obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**
