The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` equals `2`) from the list `lst`. This impacts the list `lst` and does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `lst` is `lst` without the first element
- `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`
- `ans_f` is `[0, ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]`
- `i` is `n * 2 + 1`

After executing the code:
- The element at index `2` in `lst` is removed.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `lst` is now the original `lst` with the element at index `2` removed.
- `ans` and `ans_f` remain unchanged because they depend on the elements of `lst` which have not yet been modified by this operation.
- `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is the original `lst` with the element at index 2 removed; `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`; `ans_f` is `[0, ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]`; `i` is `n * 2 + 1`**
