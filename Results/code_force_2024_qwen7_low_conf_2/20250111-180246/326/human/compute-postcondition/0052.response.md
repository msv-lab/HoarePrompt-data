Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings. If `len(lst)` is not 2, `lst` remains as a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, and `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. If `len(lst)` is 2, `lst` has its third element (if exists) removed, `ans_f` is [0], and `ans` is 1.***
