According to the given code and the current state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to analyze how the loop variable `i` changes and what conditions must be met for the loop to execute one more time.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - `i` is \(2(n + 1)\).
   - `l` is a string input by the user.
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates based on `i` and `t`.
   - The loop condition is `i < t`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `i` is \(2(n + 1)\) at the start of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.

Given that `i` is initially set to \(2(n + 1)\), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented within the loop. However, the problem does not specify how `i` is updated inside the loop. Assuming the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration (a common behavior in such loops unless otherwise specified), for the loop to execute one more time:

- `i` must be less than `t`.
- Since `i` starts at \(2(n + 1)\), the new value of `i` will be \(2(n + 1) + 1 = 2n + 3\).

Therefore, the loop will execute one more time if `2n + 3 < t`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `t` remains the same.
- `i` becomes \(2n + 3\).
- `n` remains the same.
- `l` remains the same.
- `lst` remains the same.
- `ans_f` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2n + 3\); `l` is a string input by the user; `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.**
