The given code initializes an empty list `ans_f`. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_{2n}`. The only change is that `ans_f` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer inputted by the user and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_{2n}` remain unchanged, `ans_f` is an empty list**
