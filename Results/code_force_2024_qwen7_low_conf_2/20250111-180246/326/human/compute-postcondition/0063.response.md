The given code initializes `ans` to 0. This means that the value of `ans` is set to 0, but no other operations are performed on the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `l`, and `lst` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2n + 3\); `l` is a string input by the user; `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.**
