You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans_f` is a list containing `t` elements, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f`, `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, and all elements in `ans_f` are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) indicating the number of subsequent test cases to process, followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and 2n positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, the function reads these integers, splits them into pairs, and calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair until the list of integers is reduced to 2 or fewer elements. This process is repeated for each test case, and the results are stored in a list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the list `ans_f` containing the sums of the minimum values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from being correct according to the problem description. Here are the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire list of numbers as a single string and splits it using `split(' ')`. This method will split the string at every space, which might not work correctly if the numbers contain leading or trailing spaces. It also does not handle the case where there are multiple spaces between numbers.

2. **List Management**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list in a way that is incorrect. Specifically, it tries to remove elements at indices `0 * 2` and `1 * 2`, which is always `0` and `2`, respectively, and does not properly manage the changing length of the list during removals.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop that processes the list runs `n * 2` times, but this is unnecessary since we need to process exactly `n` pairs of numbers.

4. **Test Case Handling**: The program reads `t` test cases but does not reset variables or lists for each new test case. This could lead to incorrect results if the input format or values vary across test cases.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
