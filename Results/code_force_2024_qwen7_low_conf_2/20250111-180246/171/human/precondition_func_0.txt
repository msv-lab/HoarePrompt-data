t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4. For each test case, n and l are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000 and 1 ≤ l ≤ 10^9. Each message is characterized by two integers a_i and b_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The input consists of multiple test cases, with each test case described by the number of messages n, the time the user is willing to spend l, and the characteristics a_i and b_i for each message.
