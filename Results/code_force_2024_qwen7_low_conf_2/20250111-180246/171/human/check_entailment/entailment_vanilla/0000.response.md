Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n` and `t`.
- It then reads and sorts the messages based on their `b_i` values.
- The algorithm uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum subset of messages that can be read within the time limit `t`. This is done by maintaining pointers `l` and `r` which represent the left and right boundaries of the current window of messages being considered.
- Inside the loop, it adds the `a_i` value and the difference in `b_i` values between consecutive messages to the running total `res`.
- If the total time `res` exceeds `t`, it adjusts the window by moving the left pointer `l` to reduce the time spent.
- It keeps track of the maximum size of the valid subset of messages in the variable `ans`.
- Finally, it returns the maximum size of the valid subset of messages for the current test case.

The program logic appears to match the problem description accurately and handles all aspects of the problem, including sorting the messages, using a sliding window to find the maximum subset, and considering the time constraints properly.

Correctness: **True**
