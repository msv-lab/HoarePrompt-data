You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
In the new messenger for the students of the Master's Assistance Center,
Keftemerum, an update is planned, in which developers want to optimize the set
of messages shown to the user. There are a total of n messages. Each message
is characterized by two integers a_i and b_i . The time spent reading the set
of messages with numbers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k (1 \le p_i \le n , all p_i are
distinct) is calculated by the formula:

Note that the time to read a set of messages consisting of one message with
number p_1 is equal to a_{p_1} . Also, the time to read an empty set of
messages is considered to be 0 .

The user can determine the time l that he is willing to spend in the
messenger. The messenger must inform the user of the maximum possible size of
the set of messages, the reading time of which does not exceed l . Note that
the maximum size of the set of messages can be equal to 0 .

The developers of the popular messenger failed to implement this function, so
they asked you to solve this problem.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and l (1 \leq n \leq
2000 , 1 \leq l \leq 10^9 ) — the number of messages and the time the user is
willing to spend in the messenger.

The i -th of the next n lines contains two integers a_i and b_i (1 \le a_i,
b_i \le 10^9 ) — characteristics of the i -th message.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 4
\cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible size of a
set of messages, the reading time of which does not exceed l .

Note

In the first test case, you can take a set of three messages with numbers p_1
= 3 , p_2 = 2 , and p_3 = 5 . The time spent reading this set is equal to a_3
+ a_2 + a_5 + |b_3 - b_2| + |b_2 - b_5| = 2 + 1 + 2 + |4 - 5| + |5 - 3| = 8 .

In the second test case, you can take a set of one message with number p_1 = 1
. The time spent reading this set is equal to a_1 = 4 .

In the fifth test case, it can be shown that there is no such non-empty set of
messages, the reading time of which does not exceed l .

# Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    print(func_1())
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    (n, t) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
    a = [[int(i) for i in input().split()] for i in range(n)]
    'q = int(input())\n  while q:\n    l, r = map(int, input().split())\n    q -= 1\n    '
    a.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    ans = 0
    l = r = 0
    res = 0
    while r < n:
        res += a[r][0]
        if r > 0:
            res += a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]
        while res > t:
            res -= a[l][0]
            if l < n - 1:
                res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]
            l += 1
        ans = max(ans, r - l + 1)
        r += 1
    return ans





# Execution Summary:
The function processes input data consisting of the number of messages \( n \), the time the user is willing to spend \( l \), and characteristics \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) for each message. It sorts the messages based on their \( b_i \) values and then iterates through them to find the maximum segment length \( r - l + 1 \) such that the sum of \( a_i \) values and the differences in \( b_i \) values within the segment do not exceed the given time limit \( t \). The function returns the maximum segment length found. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the total time exceeds \( t \) even when considering only one message or no valid segments exist. The function does not handle additional queries \( q \) as indicated in the commented-out code.
