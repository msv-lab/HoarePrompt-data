Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the time spent reading the set of messages according to the given formula. Specifically, the program sorts the messages based on `b_i` and then uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum subset of messages whose total reading time does not exceed `l`. However, the calculation of the total reading time is incorrect because it only adds `a_i` and the differences in `b_i` values between consecutive messages, without considering the absolute differences properly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 8
4 3
1 5
2 4
4 3
```
According to the problem description, the correct way to calculate the time for a set of messages {p1, p2, p3} would be:
\[ a_{p1} + a_{p2} + a_{p3} + |b_{p2} - b_{p1}| + |b_{p3} - b_{p2}| \]

However, the current implementation calculates:
\[ a_{p1} + a_{p2} + a_{p3} + (b_{p2} - b_{p1}) + (b_{p3} - b_{p2}) \]

This discrepancy can lead to incorrect results. For instance, in the given example, the correct maximum size of the set of messages would be 3, but the program incorrectly returns 1. Therefore, the program is not fully compliant with the problem description.
