The code initializes a 2D list `a` by taking `n` lines of input, each line containing space-separated integers. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged from the initial state, but the list `a` is updated based on the input.

Let's assume the input for `n` is `N` and the subsequent inputs for the rows of the list `a` are provided as per the range `N`.

For example, if `n` is 3 and the inputs for the rows are "1 2 3", "4 5 6", "7 8 9", then the list `a` will be:

```
a = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

Since the exact values of the inputs are not specified, we'll use placeholders. The output state will reflect the updated list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `t` is the second integer input, and `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`; `a` is a 2D list initialized with `n` rows of space-separated integers.**
