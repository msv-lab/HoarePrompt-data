`l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` was initially less than or equal to `n - 1`, after the increment, the new value of `l` is `l + 1`. The value of `res` remains unchanged because the condition `l < n - 1` is no longer satisfied after the increment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is the second integer input, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is 0, `res` is such that `res > t`.**
