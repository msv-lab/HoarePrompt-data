`res` is initially calculated as `res - 2 * a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`. The code then subtracts `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` from `res`. Given that `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`, the value of `l` changes, but `a` remains unchanged, and `r` remains unchanged. The updated value of `res` is the original value of `res` minus `2 * a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` minus `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, which simplifies to `res - 2 * a[l][0] - 2 * (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Output State: **`res` is `res - 2 * a[l][0] - 2 * (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1**
