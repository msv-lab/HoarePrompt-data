The code assigns the value 0 to both `l` and `r`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `a`, or `ans`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `t` is the second integer input, `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 0**
