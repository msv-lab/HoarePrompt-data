`res` is initially `res - a[l][0]`. The code updates `res` by subtracting the difference between `a[l + 1][1]` and `a[l][1]` from `res`. Since `a[r][0]` is greater than `t` and `l` is less than `n - 1`, these conditions remain unchanged.

The updated value of `res` is calculated as follows:
- Initial value of `res` is `res - a[l][0]`.
- After executing `res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`, `res` becomes `(res - a[l][0]) - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`res` is `(res - a[l][0]) - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, `l` is less than `n - 1`**.
