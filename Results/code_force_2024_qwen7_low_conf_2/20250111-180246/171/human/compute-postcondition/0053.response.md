`r` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1. The values of `res`, `l`, `a`, and `r` becoming `t` or less, `a`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is `t` or less, `l` is the index where `res` becomes `t` or less, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`.

Output State: **`res` is `t` or less, `l` is the index where `res` becomes `t` or less, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`**
