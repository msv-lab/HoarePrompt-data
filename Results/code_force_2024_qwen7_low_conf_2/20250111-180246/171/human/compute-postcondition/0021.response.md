Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is the second integer input, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, `r` is 0, and `res` is such that `res > t`. If `l < n - 1`, then `res` is updated to `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.***
