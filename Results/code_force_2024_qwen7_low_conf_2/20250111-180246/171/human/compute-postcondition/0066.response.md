The initial state provides that `res` is greater than `t`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `res` is equal to `res - a[l][0]`. The given code snippet updates `res` by subtracting the difference between `a[l + 1][1]` and `a[l][1]` from `res`.

Let's break down the code:
- Initially, `res` is greater than `t`.
- `l` is `l + 1`, meaning `l` is updated to its new value.
- `res` is initially equal to `res - a[l][0]`.
- Now, the code updates `res` to `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Since `res` was already equal to `res - a[l][0]`, the updated value of `res` becomes:
\[ \text{res} = (\text{res} - \text{a}[l][0]) - (\text{a}[l + 1][1] - \text{a}[l][1]) \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \text{res} = \text{res} - \text{a}[l][0] - \text{a}[l + 1][1] + \text{a}[l][1] \]

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is greater than `t`; `l` is `l + 1`; `res` is equal to `res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1]`**
