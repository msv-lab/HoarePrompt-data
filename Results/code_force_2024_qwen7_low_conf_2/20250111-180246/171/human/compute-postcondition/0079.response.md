The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. It operates on input data that is not passed as arguments but is assumed to be provided through other means (e.g., from standard input or predefined variables). The function processes multiple test cases, each containing the number of messages `n`, the time the user is willing to spend `l`, and the characteristics `a_i` and `b_i` for each message. The output is `ans`, which is the maximum value of `r - l + 1` found during the loop.
