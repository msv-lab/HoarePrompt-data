`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `res` is `res - a[l][0]` minus `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, and `l` is less than `n - 1`. After incrementing `l`, the new condition for `l` is `l < n - 1`.

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0]` minus `(a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `l` is less than `n - 1`.**
