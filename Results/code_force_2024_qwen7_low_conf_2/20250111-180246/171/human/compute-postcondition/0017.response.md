The value of `l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` was previously less than `n - 1`, incrementing `l` does not immediately affect its validity against `n - 1`. The value of `r` remains unchanged at 0. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `a`, `ans`, `res`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is the second integer input, `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `n - 1`, `r` is 0, and `res` is `res - (a[l][0] + a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])**
