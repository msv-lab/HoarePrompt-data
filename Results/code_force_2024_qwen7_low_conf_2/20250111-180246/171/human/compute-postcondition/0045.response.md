The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given that `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`, the condition `l < n - 1` will still hold true unless `l` was already equal to `n - 1`. Since the initial state mentions that `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`, it implies that `l` was originally less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the value of `res` remains unchanged, and `l` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`res` is either `res - 2 * a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` or `res - 2 * a[l][0] - 2 * (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, depending on whether `l < n - 1` holds. `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`.**
