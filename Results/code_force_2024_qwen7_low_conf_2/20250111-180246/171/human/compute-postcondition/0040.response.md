The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The initial state specifies that `l` is less than `n - 1`. After executing the code, `l` will be incremented by 1, but since the exact initial value of `l` is not given, we only know that the new value of `l` is still less than `n - 1`.

All other variables (`res`, `a`, `r`, and the condition `a[r][0] > t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is `(res - a[l][0]) - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1**
