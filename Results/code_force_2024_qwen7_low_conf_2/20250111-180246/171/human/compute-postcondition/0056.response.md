`res` is incremented by `a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1]`. Given the initial state, `res` was `t` or less, `l` is the index where `res` became `t` or less, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is `r + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, and `r - 1` must be less than `n - 1`.

Since `r` is incremented by 1, the new value of `r` is `r + 1`. The value of `res` is updated to `res + (a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1])`.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is now `res + (a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1])`, which is still `t` or less because `res` was `t` or less and the addition is based on known values. `l` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is `r + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, and `r - 1` is still less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`res` is `res + (a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1])`, `l` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `r` is `r + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, and `r - 1` is less than `n - 1`**
