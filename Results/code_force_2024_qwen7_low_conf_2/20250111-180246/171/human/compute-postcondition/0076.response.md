The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The values of the other variables (`res`, `t`, `l`, `n`, `a`, `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code. The initial conditions about these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is less than or equal to `t`, `l` is the largest index such that `res` is still greater than `t` when `res -= a[l][0]`, and `l` is less than `n - 1`; `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `r - l + 1`; `r` is increased by 1.**
