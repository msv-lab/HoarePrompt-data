Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is the second integer input, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is less than `n - 1`, `r` is 0, and `res` is `res - (a[min(l + 1, n - 1)][1] - a[l][1])`. If `l < n - 1`, `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.***
