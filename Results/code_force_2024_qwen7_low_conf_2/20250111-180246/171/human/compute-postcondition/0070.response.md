`res` is decremented by `a[l][0]`. The value of `a[l][0]` is not specified in the initial state, but since `res` must be greater than `t`, the new value of `res` will be `res - a[l][0]`, which is still greater than `t`. The value of `l` remains less than `n - 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is `res - a[l][0]` (still greater than `t`), `l` is less than `n - 1`.

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0]` (still greater than `t`), `l` is less than `n - 1`**
