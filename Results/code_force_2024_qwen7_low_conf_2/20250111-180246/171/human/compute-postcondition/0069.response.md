Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is greater than `t`
   - `l` is `l + 2`
   - If `l < n - 1`, then `res` is equal to `res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `res > t`

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `res` must still be greater than `t`.

4. **Updating States:**
   - We know `l` is updated to `l + 2`.
   - We need to ensure that `res` is greater than `t` for the next iteration.
   - The condition `l < n - 1` must hold true so that the specific update to `res` happens.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - Since we don't have the exact values of `l` and `n`, we only need to ensure that `res > t` holds true and that the condition `l < n - 1` is satisfied.
   - If `l < n - 1`, then the expression `res - a[l][0] - a[l + 1][1] + a[l][1]` updates `res`. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `res > t` and `l < n - 1` are met for the next iteration.

**Adjusted State:**
- `res` must be greater than `t`
- `l` must be less than `n - 1`

State: **`res` must be greater than `t` and `l` must be less than `n - 1`**
