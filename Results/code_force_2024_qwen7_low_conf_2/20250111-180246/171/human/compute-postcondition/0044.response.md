Postcondition: ***`res` is either `res - 2 * a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` or `res - 2 * a[l][0] - 2 * (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, depending on whether `l < n - 1` holds. `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, and `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`.***
