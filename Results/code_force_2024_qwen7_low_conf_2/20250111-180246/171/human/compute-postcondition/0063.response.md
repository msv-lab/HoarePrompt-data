The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given that the initial state is `res` is equal to `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `t` is unchanged, and `l` is less than `n - 1`, after executing `l += 1`, `l` will be one more than its previous value. Since the condition `l < n - 1` was initially true, it will still be true after incrementing `l`. Therefore, the expression `res` is equal to `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` remains valid.

Output State: **`res` is equal to `res - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `t` is unchanged, and `l` is less than `n - 1`**
