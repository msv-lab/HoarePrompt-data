The code `n, t = (int(i) for i in input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\). After executing this code, `t` is replaced by the second integer input, while `n` is assigned the first integer input.

Given the initial state and the effect of the code, the updated values are:

- `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input.
- `t` is assigned the value of the second integer input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `t` is the second integer input, and `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`.**
