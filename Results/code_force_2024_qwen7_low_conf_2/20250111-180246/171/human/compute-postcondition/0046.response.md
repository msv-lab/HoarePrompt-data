Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `res > t`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - `res` is either `res - 2 * a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` or `res - 2 * a[l][0] - 2 * (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, depending on whether `l < n - 1` holds.
   - `a` and `r` remain unchanged.
   - `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`.
   - `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need `res > t` to be true at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `l` is incremented by 1 in the loop body, we need to check the new value of `res` after the increment.

4. **Possible New Values of `res`**:
   - If `l < n - 1` was true, then `res` becomes `res - 2 * a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` after the increment.
   - If `l < n - 1` was false, then `res` becomes `res - 2 * a[l][0] - 2 * (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])` after the increment.

5. **Ensure the Loop Executes Again**:
   - We need to ensure that `res > t` is true after the next decrement.
   - Given that `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, and assuming the decrement operations reduce `res` sufficiently, we need to maintain the condition `res > t`.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `res` must be greater than `t` after the decrement operations in the next iteration.
   - Since `l` is incremented and the condition checks `l < n - 1`, the loop will continue as long as this condition holds.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `res` is greater than `t` after the decrement operations in the next iteration.

**State:**
**`res` must be greater than `t`, `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `a[r][0]` is greater than `t`, `l` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `n - 1`.**

This ensures that the loop condition `res > t` is satisfied for the next iteration.
