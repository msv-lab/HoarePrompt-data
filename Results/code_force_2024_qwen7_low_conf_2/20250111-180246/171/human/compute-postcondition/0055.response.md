`res` is incremented by `a[r][0]`. The value of `r` is updated to `r + 1` since `r` was previously incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is `t` or less, `l` is the index where `res` becomes `t` or less, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is `r + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, and `r - 1` must be less than `n - 1**
