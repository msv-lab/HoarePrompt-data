To determine the final output state after the while loop has executed, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State:
- `res` is increased by `a[r][0]`.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- If `r > 0`, then `res` is further updated to `a[r][0] + a[r][1] - a[r-1][1]`.

### Loop Code:
```python
while res > t:
    res -= a[l][0]
    if l < n - 1:
        res -= a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]
    l += 1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `res > t`.

2. **Effect of Each Iteration**:
   - `res` is decreased by `a[l][0]`.
   - If `l < n - 1`, an additional subtraction of `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` is performed.

3. **Loop Control Variable**:
   - `l` is incremented by 1 each time the loop body is executed.

4. **Final Conditions**:
   - The loop terminates when `res <= t`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### First Iteration:
- `res` is reduced by `a[l][0]`.
- If `l < n - 1`, `res` is further reduced by `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.
- `l` is incremented by 1.

#### Second Iteration:
- `res` is again reduced by `a[l][0]`.
- If `l < n - 1`, `res` is further reduced by `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.
- `l` is incremented by 1.

#### General Iteration:
- After each iteration, `res` is reduced by `a[l][0]`.
- If `l < n - 1`, `res` is also reduced by `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]`.
- `l` is incremented by 1.

### Final Output State:
- The loop continues until `res <= t`.
- After the loop, `res` will be exactly `t` or less.
- `l` will be the index where the condition `res <= t` is satisfied, and it will be one more than the last index where the subtraction was performed.

### Conclusion:
After the loop has finished executing, `res` will be `t` or less, and `l` will be the index where the condition `res <= t` is met. The value of `res` will be such that it satisfies the inequality `res <= t`.

Output State: **`res` is `t` or less, `l` is the index where `res` becomes `t` or less, `a` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged.**
