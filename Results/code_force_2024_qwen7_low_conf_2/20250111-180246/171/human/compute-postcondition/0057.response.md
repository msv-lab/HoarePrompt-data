Postcondition: ***`res` is `t` or less, `l` is the index where `res` becomes `t` or less, `a` remains unchanged, `r` is `r + 1`, `ans` is `max(0, r - l + 1)`, and `r - 1` is less than `n - 1`. If `r > 0`, then `res` is updated to `res + (a[r][1] - a[r - 1][1])`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.***
