`res` is updated by subtracting the difference between `a[l + 1][1]` and `a[l][1]` from its current value. Since the initial value of `res` is `res_initial - a_first`, and the values of `a` and `l` remain unchanged, the new value of `res` is `(res_initial - a_first) - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Output State: **`res` is `(res_initial - a_first) - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `a` is unchanged, and `l` is unchanged.**
