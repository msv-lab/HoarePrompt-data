`r` is incremented by 1. Initially, `r` is either `n - 1` or less. After the increment, `r` will be exactly `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is the second integer input with \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is the maximum of 0 and `r - l + 1`, `l` is either `n - 1` or less, `r` is `n`, and `res` is such that `res \leq t` if the loop completes, otherwise `res` will be the result of the last subtraction where `res > t`.**
