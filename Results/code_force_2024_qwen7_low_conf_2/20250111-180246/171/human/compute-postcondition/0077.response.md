Output State: **`n` is the original value of `n`, `t` is the original value of `t`, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is the maximum value of `r - l + 1` found during the loop, `l` is the largest index such that `res` is still greater than `t` when `res -= a[l][0]`, `r` is `n`, `res` is less than or equal to `t`.**
