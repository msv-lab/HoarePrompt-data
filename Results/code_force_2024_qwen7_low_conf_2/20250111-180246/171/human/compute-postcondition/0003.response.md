The code sorts the 2D list `a` based on the second element of each sublist using a lambda function as the key. The initial state includes that `n` is the first integer input, `t` is the second integer input, and `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`, and `a` is a 2D list initialized with `n` rows of space-separated integers. After sorting, the list `a` will be sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can only state that the list `a` has been sorted according to the specified key.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `t` is the second integer input, and `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`; `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist.**
