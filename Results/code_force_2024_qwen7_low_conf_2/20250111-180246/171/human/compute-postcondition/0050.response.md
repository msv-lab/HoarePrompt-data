The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `l` is unchanged unless `l < n - 1`, the value of `l` will be updated by 1 if it was less than `n - 1`. If `l` was already `n - 1` or more, the value of `l` remains unchanged. The values of `res` and `a` remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial - a_first - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `a` is unchanged, and `l` is incremented by 1 if `l` was less than `n - 1`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
