`res` is initially `res - a[l][0]` and is still greater than `t`. The value of `l` is less than `n - 1`. The code subtracts `a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1]` from `res`. Therefore, the new value of `res` becomes `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`.

Output State: **`res` is `res - a[l][0] - (a[l + 1][1] - a[l][1])`, `l` is less than `n - 1`**
