Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is the second integer input, `1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4`, `a` is a 2D list sorted in ascending order based on the second element of each sublist, `ans` is 0, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `res` is the previous value of `res` plus the difference between `a[r][1]` and `a[r - 1][1]` if `r > 0`. Otherwise, `r` remains 0 and `res` remains unchanged.***
