`res` is decremented by the value of `a[l][0]`. Since `l` must be `l + 1`, the value of `l` is actually `l + 1`. However, the exact values of `res` and `a[l][0]` are not specified, but we know `res` must be greater than `t`. Therefore, after the operation, `res` will be `res - a[l][0]`, which is still greater than `t`. The value of `l` changes to `l + 1`.

Output State: **`res` is greater than `t`; `l` is `l + 1`; `res` is equal to `res - a[l][0]`**
