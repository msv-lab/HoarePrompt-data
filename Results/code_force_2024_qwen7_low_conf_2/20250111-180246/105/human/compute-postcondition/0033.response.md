The code `a += a[-1] + y` updates the list `a` by adding the sum of its last element (`a[-1]`) and the value of `y` to the last element of `a`. Let's break this down:

- Initially, `a` is `a_initial` with the last element replaced by the sum of the last element and `y_initial`. This means `a[-1]` is `y_initial`.
- The code `a += a[-1] + y` adds `a[-1]` (which is `y_initial`) and `y` to `a[-1]`.

Therefore, the new last element of `a` will be `y_initial + y + y_initial = y_initial + y + y_initial`.

The value of `y` is the next element in the sorted `R()`, but since the exact value of `y` is not specified, we keep it as `y`.

Output State: **`a` is `a_initial` with the last element replaced by `y_initial + y + y_initial`, and `y` is the next element in the sorted `R()`**
