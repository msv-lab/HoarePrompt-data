The code `n, k, x = R()` assigns values from the function `R()` to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified, we can only state that these variables are assigned values from `R()`. The initial state of `t` is "at least 1", which means `t` could be any integer greater than or equal to 1.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a value returned by `R()`, `k` is a value returned by `R()`, `x` is a value returned by `R()`**
