The code snippet `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` appends the value of `q[-1] + a[i]` to the list `q`. 

- `i` starts at 1, and since the exact value of `i` is not specified beyond its initial value, we assume `i` increments during the loop, but we only consider the immediate effect of this line of code.
- `n` is greater than 0 and is the input integer.
- `k` is the input integer, not affected by this line of code.
- `x` is the input integer, not affected by this line of code.
- `p` remains `-100000`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers, not affected by this line of code.
- `q` is initially `[0]` followed by the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. After the operation, `q` will have one more element which is `q[-1] + a[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `p` is -100000.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `q` is a list with `n + 1` elements starting with `q[0] = 0`, and subsequent elements are sums of the first `i` elements of `a`.

After executing the code snippet `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])`, the list `q` will have one additional element.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `p` is -100000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `q` is a list with `n + 1` elements where `q[0] = 0` and `q[i]` (for `i = 1` to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, and `q` has an additional element which is `q[-1] + a[i]`**.
