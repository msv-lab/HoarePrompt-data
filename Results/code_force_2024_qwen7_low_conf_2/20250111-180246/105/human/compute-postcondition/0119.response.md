The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. Instead, it implies that the parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` are provided through some external means (such as being passed from a calling context or being read from an input source). 

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\).
- There is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\) for all \(i\).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

The function does not explicitly return anything in the given information, but based on typical problem structures, it might return results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` through an external context, processes each test case according to the given constraints, and returns results for each test case.**
