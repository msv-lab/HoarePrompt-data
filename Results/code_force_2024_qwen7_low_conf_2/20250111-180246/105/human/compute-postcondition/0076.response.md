Postcondition: ***`i` is \( n - k \), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is \( 2 * q[l] - q[i] \), `m` is updated to \( 2 * q[l] - q[i] \) if \( m > p \); otherwise, the value of `m` remains unchanged, `l` is either 0 or \( n - k - x \), `q` is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements where `q[0] = 0` and `q[i]` (for `i = 1 to n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`.***
