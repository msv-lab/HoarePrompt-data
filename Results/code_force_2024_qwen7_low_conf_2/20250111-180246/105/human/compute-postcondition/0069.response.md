Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is `-100000`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, `q` is a list with `n + 1` elements where `q[0] = 0` and `q[i]` (for `i = 1` to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, `l` is either `0` or `n - x` depending on whether `n - x` is less than `1` or not, if `m > p`, then the postcondition remains as described in the if part, otherwise, no change in the values of the variables.***
