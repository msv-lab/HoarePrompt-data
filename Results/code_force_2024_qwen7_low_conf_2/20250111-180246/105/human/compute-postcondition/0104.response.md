The code `l = i - x` assigns the value of `i - x` to the variable `l`. The previous value of `l` was defined as `i - x` if `i - x` is less than 1, otherwise `l` is `i - x`. After the assignment, the new value of `l` will be `i - x`.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is `n + 1`; `l` is `i - x`; `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `l` is `i - x`; `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`**
