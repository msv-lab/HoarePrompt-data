The code appends the value of `q[-1] + a[i]` to the list `q`. However, the value of `a` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no loop or other context that defines the iteration over `a`. Given the current information, we can only state that `q` is updated, but we cannot determine the exact value added to `q` without knowing the values of `q[-1]` and `a[i]`.

Since `q[0]` is initially 0, the next value added to `q` would be `q[-1] + a[i]`, which means the second element of `q` (i.e., `q[1]`) would be `0 + a[i]` or simply `a[i]`.

The states of other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `p`, `m`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is updated to a new integer value, `k` is updated to a new integer value, `x` is updated to a new integer value, `p` is -100000, `m` is calculated within the loop, `q` is a list with at least two elements, where `q[0]` is 0 and `q[1]` is `a[i]`.**
