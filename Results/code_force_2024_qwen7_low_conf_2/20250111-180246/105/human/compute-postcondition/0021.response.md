The code `a += a[-1] + y,` updates the list `a` by adding the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[-1]`) to `y` and appending the result to `a`. However, the value of `y` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `a` initially is `[0, y_next]`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Initially, `a = [0, y_next]`.
2. The last element of `a` is `y_next`.
3. Adding `y_next` to `y` gives `y_next + y`.
4. Appending `y_next + y` to `a` results in `a = [0, y_next, y_next + y]`.

The output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` must ensure `R()` returns at least one value, `k` must ensure `R()` returns at least one value, `x` must ensure `R()` returns at least one value, `a` is `[0, y_next, y_next + y]`**
