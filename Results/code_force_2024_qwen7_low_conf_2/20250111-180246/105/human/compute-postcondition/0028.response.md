The code `n, k, x = R()` assigns the values returned by the function `R()` to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x`. Since the initial state includes that `t` is 0, `n` is a specific value, `k` is a specific value, `x` is a specific value, and `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of the sorted values returned by `R()`, these assignments will change the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.

The output of the function `R()` could be any specific values, but since we don't know the exact values, we will represent them as `n_val`, `k_val`, and `x_val` respectively.

After executing `n, k, x = R()`, the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` will be updated to `n_val`, `k_val`, and `x_val`, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `x` is `x_val`, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of the sorted values returned by `R()`.**
