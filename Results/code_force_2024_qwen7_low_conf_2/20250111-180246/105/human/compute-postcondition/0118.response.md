Output State: **`t` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `p` is the maximum value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]` over all iterations where `l` is either 0 or `i - x` depending on the condition, `q` is a list with `n + 1` elements where `q[0] = 0` and `q[i]` (for `i = 1` to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, `i` is `n + 1`.**
