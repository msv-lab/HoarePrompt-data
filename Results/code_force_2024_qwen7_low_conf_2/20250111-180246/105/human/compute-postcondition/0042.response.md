The input `.split()` function splits the input string into individual elements, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list is assigned to `a`, updating the value of `a`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `q`, `p`, and `m` are no longer directly relevant since they were not used in the provided code snippet.

Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. The user inputs a series of space-separated integers.
2. These integers are split and converted to a list of integers, which is then assigned to `a`.

The initial states of `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `q`, `p`, and `m` are not used in the code, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created from the input, `n` is updated to a new integer value, `k` is updated to a new integer value, `x` is updated to a new integer value, `i` is `n + 1`, `q[j] = sum(a[:j])` for `0 <= j <= n`, `p` is printed, and `m` is calculated within the loop.**
