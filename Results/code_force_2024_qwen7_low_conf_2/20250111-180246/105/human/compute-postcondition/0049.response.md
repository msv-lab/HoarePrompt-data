The code snippet `q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` impacts the list `q`. Specifically, it appends the sum of the last element in `q` and `a[i]` to `q`. 

- Initially, `q[0]` is 0 and `q[1]` is `a[i]`.
- After appending, `q` will have an additional element which is `q[-1] + a[i]`.

Since the initial state includes `i` being `n - 1`, `n` being an updated integer, `k` being an updated integer, `x` being an updated integer, `p` being `-100000`, and `m` being calculated within the loop (but no specific value is given for `m`), these variables remain unchanged except for `q`.

Therefore, the updated state of `q` is `q[0]` is 0, `q[1]` is `a[i]`, and `q[2]` is `a[i] + a[i]` (or `2 * a[i]`).

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an updated integer, `k` is an updated integer, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is -100000, `m` is calculated within the loop, `q` is a list with at least three elements where `q[0]` is 0, `q[1]` is `a[i]`, and `q[2]` is `2 * a[i]`**
