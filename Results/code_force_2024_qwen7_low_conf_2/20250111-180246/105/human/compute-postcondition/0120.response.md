Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), along with a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It sorts the list \( a \) and calculates a cumulative sum array \( q \). For each test case, it finds the maximum value of \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) where \( l \) ranges from 0 to \( n-k \) and \( i \) ranges from \( n-k \) to \( n \). If \( i-x < 1 \), then \( l = 0 \); otherwise, \( l = i - x \). The function outputs the maximum value found for each test case. Potential edge cases include when \( i - x \) is less than 1, which is handled correctly in the code. The function assumes valid input within the specified constraints.**
