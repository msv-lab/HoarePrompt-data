The code snippet updates the variable `a` by adding the last element of `a` plus `y` to the end of the list `a`. Since `R()` returns a non-empty list, let's assume the initial state of `a` is `R()`. However, without the exact initial value of `a` or `y`, we can only describe the change in terms of these variables.

Let's denote the initial value of `a` as `a_initial` and the initial value of `y` as `y_initial`. After executing the line of code, the last element of `a` (which is the last element of `a_initial`) is added to `y_initial` and then appended to `a`.

Output State: **`a` is `a_initial` with the last element replaced by the sum of the last element and `y_initial`, and `y` is `y_initial`**
