Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( \text{`i` is } n \)
- \( \text{n is an integer} \)
- \( \text{k is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1} \)
- \( \text{x is an updated integer} \)
- \( \text{p is } -100000 \)
- \( \text{m is } 2 * q[l] - q[n] \)
- \( \text{q is a list with n + 1 elements where q[0] = 0 and q[i] (for i = 1 to n) is the sum of the first i elements of a} \)
- \( \text{l is either 0 or n - x depending on whether n - x is less than 1 or not} \)
- \( \text{if m > p, then the postcondition remains as described in the if part, otherwise, no change in the values of the variables} \)

### For Loop Analysis:
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means the loop will iterate over the range from \( n - k \) to \( n \) inclusive.

### Current Value of `i`:
- According to the initial state, at the end of the previous iteration, \( \text{i is } n \).

### Next Iteration:
Since the loop iterates over the range \( n - k \) to \( n \), the value of \( i \) should decrease from \( n \) to \( n - k \).

### Key Points to Adjust:
1. **Value of `i`:** Since the loop starts at \( n - k \) and increases `i` towards \( n \), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be \( n - k \).
2. **Value of `k`:** The value of `k` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body.
3. **Values of `p`, `m`, `q`, `l`:** These values depend on the operations performed within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot infer changes directly but assume they remain unchanged unless modified inside the loop.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the following adjustments need to be made to the state:
- \( \text{i is } n - k \)
- \( \text{n is an integer} \)
- \( \text{k is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1} \)
- \( \text{x is an updated integer} \)
- \( \text{p is } -100000 \)
- \( \text{m is } 2 * q[l] - q[n] \)
- \( \text{q is a list with n + 1 elements where q[0] = 0 and q[i] (for i = 1 to n) is the sum of the first i elements of a} \)
- \( \text{l is either 0 or n - x depending on whether n - x is less than 1 or not} \)

Thus, the new state is:
State: **`i` is \( n - k \), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is -100000, `m` is 2 * q[l] - q[n], `q` is a list with n + 1 elements where q[0] = 0 and q[i] (for i = 1 to n) is the sum of the first i elements of a, l is either 0 or n - x depending on whether n - x is less than 1 or not**.
