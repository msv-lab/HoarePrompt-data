The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, the function receives three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\).
- Additionally, the function receives an array of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\).

The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function returns different outputs depending on the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`. However, since the specific output logic is not detailed in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters and their types.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept `t` test cases, each containing `n`, `k`, `x`, and an array of `n` integers `a`, and process these inputs according to the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t`, and for each of the `t` test cases, it accepts three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` and an array of `n` integers `a`.**
