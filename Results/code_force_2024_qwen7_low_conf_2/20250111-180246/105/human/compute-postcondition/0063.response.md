Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- \( i \) is \( n - 1 \)
- \( n \) is an integer
- \( k \) is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1
- \( x \) is an updated integer
- \( p \) is \(-100000\)
- \( m \) is \(2 \times q[l] - q[i]\)
- \( q \) is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements where \( q[0] = 0 \) and \( q[i] \) (for \( i = 1 \) to \( n \)) is the sum of the first \( i \) elements of \( a \)
- \( l \) is either 0 or \( i - x \) depending on whether \( i - x \) is less than 1 or not
- If \( m > p \), then the function continues with the updated value of \( m \). Otherwise, the values remain unchanged as there is no else part specified.

### Loop Statement
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from \( n - k \) to \( n \).
2. **Current State of \( i \)**: \( i \) is currently \( n - 1 \).

Since the loop starts from \( n - k \) and goes up to \( n \), and \( i \) is currently \( n - 1 \), the next value of \( i \) will be \( n \).

3. **Updating States**:
   - \( i \) will be updated to \( n \).
   - \( m \) needs to be recalculated based on the new value of \( i \).
   - \( l \) needs to be recalculated based on the new value of \( i \).
   - Other variables like \( p \), \( x \), \( k \), etc., do not change unless specifically modified within the loop body.

### Updated States
- \( i \) will be \( n \).
- \( m \) will be recalculated as \( m = 2 \times q[l'] - q[n] \), where \( l' \) is determined by the condition \( l' = 0 \) or \( l' = n - x \).
- \( p \) remains \(-100000\).
- \( q \) remains unchanged as the list is not modified outside the loop.
- \( l \) will be either 0 or \( n - x \).

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is \( n \), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is \(-100000\), `m` is \(2 \times q[l'] - q[n]\), `q` is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements where \( q[0] = 0 \) and \( q[i] \) (for \( i = 1 \) to \( n \)) is the sum of the first \( i \) elements of \( a \), `l` is either 0 or \( n - x \) depending on whether \( n - x \) is less than 1 or not**.

(Note: \( l' \) is the value of \( l \) calculated based on the condition, which could be 0 or \( n - x \)).
