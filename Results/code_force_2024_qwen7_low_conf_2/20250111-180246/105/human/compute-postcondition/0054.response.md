Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is -100000, `m` is calculated within the loop, `q` is a list with `n + 1` elements where `q[0]` is 0 and `q[i]` (for `i = 1` to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`. The current value of `i - x` is less than 1***
