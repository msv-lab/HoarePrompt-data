`q.append(q[-1] + a[i])` appends a new element to the list `q`. Given the initial state, `q` is a list with at least three elements where `q[0]` is 0, `q[1]` is `a[i]`, and `q[2]` is `2 * a[i]`. The new element appended is `q[-1] + a[i]`, which is `2 * a[i] + a[i] = 3 * a[i]`.

Since `a[i]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `q[3]` will be `3 * a[i]`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `p`, `m`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is updated to `n + 1`, `k` is an updated integer, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is -100000, `m` is calculated within the loop, `q` is a list with at least four elements where `q[0]` is 0, `q[1]` is `a[i]`, `q[2]` is `2 * a[i]`, and `q[3]` is `3 * a[i]`.**
