Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(x\), and an array of \(n\) integers \(a\). For each test case, it reads the input values, sorts them, computes the cumulative sums, and then calculates the maximum value of the expression \(2 \cdot a[\max(i, x) - x] - a[i]\) for \(i\) in the range from \(n - k\) to \(n\). The function prints this maximum value for each test case.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If \(n - k < 0\), the range from \(n - k\) to \(n\) would be invalid. However, since \(n \geq 1\) and \(k \geq 1\), this specific edge case cannot occur.
- The function assumes that the input values are valid (i.e., \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\), and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\)). It does not handle cases where these constraints are violated, although the function will likely terminate with an error if such invalid inputs are provided.
