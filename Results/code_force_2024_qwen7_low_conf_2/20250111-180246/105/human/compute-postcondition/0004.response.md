`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `R()`. The value of `t` is updated to be its original value minus 1 and must not be zero. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `R()`.

Output State: **`t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero; `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values returned by `R()`**
