`a` is updated by adding its last element (`a[-1]`) to `y`. The value of `y` is the next element in the sorted `R()`.

Given that the last element of `a` is replaced by `y_initial + y + y_initial`, we can denote the last element of `a` as `y_initial + y + y_initial`.

Let's denote the new last element of `a` as `last_element_new`. The new last element of `a` is `a[-1] + y`.

So, `last_element_new = (y_initial + y + y_initial) + y = y_initial + 2*y + y_initial`.

Since the rest of the elements in `a` are unchanged, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is `a_initial` with the last element replaced by `y_initial + 2*y + y_initial`, and `y` is the next element in the sorted `R()`**
