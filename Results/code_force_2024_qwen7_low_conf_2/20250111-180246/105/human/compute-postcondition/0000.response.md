The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input and splits it into integers. However, the function itself does not execute any operations that would change the values of the variables in the initial state. Instead, it sets up a way to read input later in the program. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), each test case contains three integers `n`, `k`, and `x` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq x, k \leq n\), and an array of `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 1000\); the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\); the lambda function `R` is defined to read input and split it into integers.**
