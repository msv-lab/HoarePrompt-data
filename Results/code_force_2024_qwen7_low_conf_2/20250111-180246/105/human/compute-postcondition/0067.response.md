Let's analyze the given code step by step:

Initial State:
- `i` is \( n \)
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1
- `x` is an updated integer
- `p` is \(-100000\)
- `m` is \(2 \times q[l'] - q[n]\), where \( l' \) is either 0 or \( n - x \) depending on the condition \( n - x < 1 \)
- `q` is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements where \( q[0] = 0 \) and \( q[i] \) (for \( i = 1 \) to \( n \)) is the sum of the first \( i \) elements of \( a \)
- `l` is either 0 or \( n - x \) depending on whether \( n - x \) is less than 1 or not

Code:
```python
m = 2 * q[l] - q[i]
```

Impact Analysis:
1. The value of `m` is updated to be \(2 \times q[l] - q[i]\).
2. The values of `q`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Let's express the final values of the variables:
- `i` is still \( n \)
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` remains unchanged
- `x` remains unchanged
- `p` remains \(-100000\)
- `m` is now \(2 \times q[l] - q[n]\)
- `q` remains the same
- `l` remains either 0 or \( n - x \)

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is \( n \), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is \(-100000\), `m` is \(2 \times q[l] - q[n]\), `q` is a list with \( n + 1 \) elements where \( q[0] = 0 \) and \( q[i] \) (for \( i = 1 \) to \( n \)) is the sum of the first \( i \) elements of \( a \), `l` is either 0 or \( n - x \) depending on whether \( n - x \) is less than 1 or not.**
