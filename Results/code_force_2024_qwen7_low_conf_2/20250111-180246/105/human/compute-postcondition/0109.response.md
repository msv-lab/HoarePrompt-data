To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop iteration step-by-step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- \( i \) is \( n + 1 \)
- \( l \) is \( 0 \) if \( i - x < 1 \), otherwise \( l \) is \( i - x \)
- \( m \) is \( 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \)
- \( q \) remains unchanged
- If \( m > p \), then \( m = 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \) and \( p = 2 \times q[l] - q[i] \). Otherwise, no changes are made to \( m \), \( p \), \( i \), \( l \), and \( q \) remain as initially defined.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n - k, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Values of \( i \):**
   - The loop starts with \( i \) set to \( n + 1 \).

2. **Range of the For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from \( n - k \) to \( n + 1 \).
   - Therefore, the first iteration starts with \( i = n + 1 \).

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as \( i \) is within the range \( n - k \) to \( n + 1 \).
   - Since \( i \) starts at \( n + 1 \) and the range is inclusive, the next value of \( i \) would be \( n \).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since \( i \) is set to \( n + 1 \) initially, the next iteration will set \( i \) to \( n \).
   - The values of \( l \), \( m \), and \( p \) will remain unchanged as per the conditions given (since \( i \) is already outside the specified range for further iterations).

### New States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- \( i \) is now \( n \)
- \( l \) remains the same as the previous iteration
- \( m \) remains the same as the previous iteration
- \( p \) remains the same as the previous iteration
- \( q \) remains unchanged

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- \( i \) is \( n \)

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is \( n \), \( l \) is the same as the previous iteration, \( m \) is the same as the previous iteration, \( p \) is the same as the previous iteration, and \( q \) remains unchanged.**
