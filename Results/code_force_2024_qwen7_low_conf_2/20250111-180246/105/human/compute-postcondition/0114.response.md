`p` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, `m` is defined as `2 * q[l] - q[n]`. Since `l` is either `0` if `n - x < 1` or `n - x` if `n - x >= 1`, and `m` is already calculated based on these conditions, `p` will take the same value as `m`. The values of `i`, `l`, `m`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `l` is either `0` if `n - x < 1` or `n - x` if `n - x >= 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, `p` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, and `q` remains unchanged.**
