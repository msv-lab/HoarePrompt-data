The code assigns `m` the value of `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. To determine the new values of the variables, we need to consider the conditions for `l` based on the initial state.

From the initial state:
- `i` is `n`.
- `l` is either `0` or `n - x` depending on whether `i - x < 1`.
- `m` is the same as the previous iteration.
- `p` is the same as the previous iteration.
- `q` remains unchanged.

Since `i` is `n`, we need to evaluate the condition for `l`:
- If `n - x < 1`, then `l` is `0`.
- Otherwise, `l` is `n - x`.

We do not know the exact values of `n` and `x`, so we consider both cases:

1. If `n - x < 1`, then `l` is `0`.
   - In this case, `m = 2 * q[0] - q[n]`.

2. If `n - x >= 1`, then `l` is `n - x`.
   - In this case, `m = 2 * q[n - x] - q[n]`.

In both cases, the values of `i`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `l` is either `0` if `n - x < 1` or `n - x` if `n - x >= 1`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[n]`, `p` is the same as the previous iteration, and `q` remains unchanged.**
