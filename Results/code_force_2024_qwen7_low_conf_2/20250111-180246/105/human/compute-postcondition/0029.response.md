The code snippet initializes the list `a` with the value `[0]`. This means that the list `a` now contains one element, which is `0`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x`, as well as the list `a` itself, are updated as follows:

- `t` remains `0` because no operation affects it.
- `n` remains `n_val` because no operation affects it.
- `k` remains `k_val` because no operation affects it.
- `x` remains `x_val` because no operation affects it.
- `a` is now `[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is `n_val`, `k` is `k_val`, `x` is `x_val`, `a` is `[0]`**
