Output State: **`t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero, `n` is `val_n`, `k` is `val_k`, `x` is `val_x`, `a` is a list where the first element is 0, and subsequent elements are sums based on the sorted order of elements from `R()`. Specifically, each element \(a[i]\) (for \(i > 0\)) is calculated as \(a[i-1] + y_i\) where \(y_i\) is the \(i\)-th smallest element from the sorted list returned by `R()` when the loop executes.**
