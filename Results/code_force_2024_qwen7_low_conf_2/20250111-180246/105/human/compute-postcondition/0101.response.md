Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `l` is `i - x` if `i - x` is less than 1, otherwise `l` is `i - x`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. If `m > p`, then the function does not change `i`, `l`, and `m`. If `m <= p`, then the function does not change `i`, `l`, and `m` as well.*** 

This postcondition consolidates the conditions under which the values of `i`, `l`, and `m` remain unchanged regardless of whether the if condition (`m > p`) is true or false.
