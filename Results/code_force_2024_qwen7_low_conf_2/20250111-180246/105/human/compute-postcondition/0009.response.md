The code `a += a[-1] + y` means that the last element of the list `a` (which is `a[-1]`) is added to `y`, and the result is appended to the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `R()` must contain at least one element.
- `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero.
- `n` is `val_n`.
- `k` is `val_k`.
- `x` is `val_x`.
- `a` is `[0, y]` where `y` is the next smallest element in the sorted set `R()`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The initial list `a` is `[0, y]`.
2. The last element of `a` is `a[-1]`, which is `y`.
3. The code adds `a[-1]` (which is `y`) to `y`, resulting in `y + y` or `2 * y`.
4. This sum (`2 * y`) is appended to the list `a`.

So, the updated list `a` becomes `[0, y, 2 * y]`.

Output State: **`R()` must contain at least one element, `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero, `n` is `val_n`, `k` is `val_k`, `x` is `val_x`, `a` is `[0, y, 2 * y]`**
