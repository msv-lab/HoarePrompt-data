Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

- Initial State: `R()` must contain at least one element, `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero, `n` is `val_n`, `k` is `val_k`, `x` is `val_x`, `a` is `[0, next_y, 2 * next_y]` where `next_y` is the next smallest element in `R()`

The code snippet is:
```python
a += a[-1] + y,
```

Here's what this line does:
1. It appends the sum of `a[-1]` (the last element in `a`) and `y` to the list `a`.

Since `a` is initially `[0, next_y, 2 * next_y]`, `a[-1]` is `2 * next_y`.

Thus, the new element appended to `a` is `2 * next_y + y`.

So, the updated list `a` will be:
```python
[0, next_y, 2 * next_y, 2 * next_y + y]
```

All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`R()` must contain at least one element, `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero, `n` is `val_n`, `k` is `val_k`, `x` is `val_x`, `a` is `[0, next_y, 2 * next_y, 2 * next_y + y]`**
