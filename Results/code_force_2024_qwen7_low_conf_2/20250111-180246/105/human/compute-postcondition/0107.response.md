`p` is assigned the value of `m`. From the initial state, we know that `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, where `l` is `0` if `i - x < 1`, otherwise `l` is `i - x`. The value of `p` is therefore `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `l` is `0` if `i - x < 1`, otherwise `l` is `i - x`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, and `p` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`.**
