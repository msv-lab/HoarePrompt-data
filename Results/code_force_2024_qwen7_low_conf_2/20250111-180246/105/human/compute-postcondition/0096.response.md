The code `l = i - x` assigns the value of `i - x` to `l`. Given that `i` is `n` and the difference between `i` and `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `l` will be a positive integer. The other variables `i` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n`; `x` is such that the difference between `i` and `x` is greater than or equal to 1; `l` is `i - x`.**
