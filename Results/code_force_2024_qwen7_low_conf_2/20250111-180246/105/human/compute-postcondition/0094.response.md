The code initializes a new variable `l` and assigns it the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the values of the existing variables `i`, `n`, and `x`. Therefore, the only change is that `l` is now `0`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `n - k` must be less than or equal to `n`; `l` is 0**
