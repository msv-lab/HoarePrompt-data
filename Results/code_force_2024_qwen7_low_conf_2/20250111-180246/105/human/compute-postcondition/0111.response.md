`l` is assigned the value of `i - x`. The value of `i` is \( n \), but the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `l` will be \( n - x \). The values of `i`, `m`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their previous iterations.

Output State: **`i` is \( n \), `l` is \( n - x \), `m` is the same as the previous iteration, `p` is the same as the previous iteration, and `q` remains unchanged.**
