`t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially set to the first integer from the input provided by `R()` and must not be zero, the new value of `t` is the original value minus 1. The precondition that `t` must not be zero is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero**
