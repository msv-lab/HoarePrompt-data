Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the final value of `n_val` after all iterations, `k` is the final value of `k_val`, `x` is the final value of `x_val`, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by cumulative sums of the sorted values returned by `R()` for each iteration, and the final output is the maximum value of the expression `2 * a[max(i, x) - x] - a[i]` for `i` in the range from `n - k` to `n`.**
