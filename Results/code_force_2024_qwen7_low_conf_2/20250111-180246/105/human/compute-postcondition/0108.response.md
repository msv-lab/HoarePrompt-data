Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `l` is `0` if `i - x < 1`, otherwise `l` is `i - x`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, and `q` remains unchanged. If `m > p`, the condition `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]` and `p` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]` holds. If `m <= p`, no changes are made to `m`, `p`, `i`, `l`, and `q` remain as initially defined.***
