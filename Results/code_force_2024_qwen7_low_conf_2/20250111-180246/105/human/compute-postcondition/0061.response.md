`p` is assigned the value of `m`. The value of `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, and since `p` now equals `m`, the value of `p` becomes `2 * q[l] - q[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer and must be less than or equal to 1, `x` is an updated integer, `p` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, `m` is `2 * q[l] - q[i]`, `q` is a list with `n + 1` elements where `q[0]` is 0 and `q[i]` (for `i = 1` to `n`) is the sum of the first `i` elements of `a`, `l` is either 0 or `i - x` depending on whether `i - x` is less than 1 or not.**
