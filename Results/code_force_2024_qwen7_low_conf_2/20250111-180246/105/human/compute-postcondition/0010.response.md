Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `R()` must contain at least one element.
- `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero.
- `n` is `val_n`.
- `k` is `val_k`.
- `x` is `val_x`.
- `a` is `[0, y, 2 * y]`.

### Loop Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for y in sorted(R()):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over elements in `sorted(R())`.
2. **State Before Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `R()` must contain at least one element after the current `y` is processed.
   - The variable `y` will take the next smallest value from `R()`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States
1. **Ensure `R()` contains at least one element**: This condition must still hold true for the next iteration.
2. **Update `y`**: The value of `y` will be the next smallest element in `R()`.
3. **No other variables are affected by the loop directly**: Variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since they are not mentioned as being changed in the problem statement, we assume they stay the same.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration
- `R()` must contain at least one element (same as before).
- `t` remains the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero (no change in value or condition).
- `n` remains `val_n`.
- `k` remains `val_k`.
- `x` remains `val_x`.
- `a` remains `[0, y, 2 * y]` where `y` is the next smallest element from `R()`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`R()` must contain at least one element, `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero, `n` is `val_n`, `k` is `val_k`, `x` is `val_x`, `a` is `[0, next_y, 2 * next_y]` where `next_y` is the next smallest element in `R()`**.
