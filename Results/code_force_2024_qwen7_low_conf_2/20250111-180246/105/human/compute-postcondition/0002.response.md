According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., not zero, not an empty string, etc.), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is set to the first integer from the input provided by `R()`. Since `R()` provides an integer, `t` being an integer does not guarantee that it is truthy. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is not zero.

No other states need to be adjusted as per the given information.

State: **`t` is set to the first integer from the input provided by `R()` and `t` must not be zero**
