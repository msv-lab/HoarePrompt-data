Let's break down the given information and the `while` loop condition step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero.
   - `n` is `val_n`.
   - `k` is `val_k`.
   - `x` is `val_x`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The output is the maximum value of the expression \(2 \cdot a[\max(i, x) - x] - a[i]\) for `i` in the range from `n - k` to `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero at the start of the new iteration.
   - Since `t` is defined as the original value of `t` minus 1, and it must not be zero at the start of the new iteration, we need to ensure that the original value of `t` was at least 1 (since it has been decremented by 1).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that the original value of `t` was at least 1, meaning `t` itself must be at least 2 (since it was decremented by 1).

Therefore, the necessary adjustment to the state is to ensure that `t` is at least 2, since the original value of `t` was 1 more than `t` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is the original value of `t` minus 1 and must not be zero (which means `t` must be at least 2), `n` is `val_n`, `k` is `val_k`, `x` is `val_x`, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the output is the maximum value of the expression \(2 \cdot a[\max(i, x) - x] - a[i]\) for `i` in the range from `n - k` to `n + 1`**.
