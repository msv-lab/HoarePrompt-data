Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Alice removes at most `k` elements.
   - Bob multiplies at most `x` elements by `-1`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the sum, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - Alice should ideally remove the smallest `k` elements.
   - Bob will then flip the sign of the `x` largest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - The program uses a lambda function `R` to read space-separated integers from input.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - An array `a` is initialized with a leading zero and filled by accumulating the sorted values of the input array.
   - The maximum sum is computed using a generator expression within `max()` which evaluates the possible sums after Alice's and Bob's moves.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that Alice can remove the smallest elements.
   - The accumulated sums in `a` allow efficient computation of potential final sums.
   - The logic inside the `max()` function correctly computes the maximum possible sum considering the optimal removal and flipping operations.

Given the logic and implementation match the problem requirements and the detailed reasoning above, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
