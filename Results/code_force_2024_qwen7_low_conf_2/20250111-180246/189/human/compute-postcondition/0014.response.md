The code assigns the return value of `func_1(n)` to `result`. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `n`, and its return value is stored in `result`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is the integer value of `data[k + 4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n)` appended, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 3`, `result` is `func_1(n)`**
