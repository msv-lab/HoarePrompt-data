`n` is assigned the value of `data[i + 1]` converted to an integer. The variable `i` is defined as `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` in the previous iteration, so `i` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 1`.**
