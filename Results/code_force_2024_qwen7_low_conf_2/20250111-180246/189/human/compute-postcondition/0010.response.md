The code `result = func_1(n)` assigns the return value of `func_1(n)` to the variable `result`. The value of `n` is known, but since `func_1(n)` is called, its exact return value is not specified in the initial state. However, the return value will replace the existing value of `result`, which was previously equal to the return value of `func_1(n)`.

Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `result`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 1`, `result` is now the return value of `func_1(n)`**
