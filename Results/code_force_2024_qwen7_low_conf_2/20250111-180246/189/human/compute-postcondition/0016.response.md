Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n)` for each iteration, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`**.

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`:
  - `n` is set to the integer value of `data[i + 1]`.
  - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`.
  - `results.append(result)` appends the return value to the `results` list.
- After all iterations, `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(n)` for each `n` in the specified range.
- The variable `i` will be `t - 1` after the last iteration.
- The original value of `n` used in each iteration is derived from the elements in `data`.

Thus, the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop is described as above.
