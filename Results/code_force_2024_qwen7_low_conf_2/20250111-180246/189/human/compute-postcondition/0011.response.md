`results` is a list that appends the value of `result`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, which was previously assigned to `result`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n)` appended, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 1`.
