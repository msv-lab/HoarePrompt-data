The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are taken from the next pair in the `results` list. However, since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified in the initial state, we will keep them as `x` and `y`. The `print` function does not change the values of the variables; it only outputs them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `x` and `y` are printed.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least three pairs of elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the next element's first value, `y` is the next element's second value, `x` and `y` are printed**
