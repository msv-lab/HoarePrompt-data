Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - The print statement outputs `1 i`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, n - 1)`.
   - Currently, `i` is `n-2`.
   - The range for `i` is from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).

Given that `i` is currently `n-2`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already at the upper limit of the range (`n-2`), and the range goes up to `n-2` but does not include `n-1`.

However, if we assume there might be some additional conditions or modifications needed, let's consider the general process:

- If `i` were to be incremented or modified within the loop body, it would need to be set to a value within the range `1` to `n-2`.
- Since `i` is already `n-2`, no further adjustments are needed unless the loop body changes `i` to a valid value.

Since the loop condition is met with `i` being `n-2`, the only thing that needs adjustment is ensuring `i` remains within the range for the next iteration. But given the current setup, no change is required as the loop condition is naturally satisfied.

**Conclusion:**

The states do not need to be adjusted because `i` is already at its upper limit for the current range. The loop cannot execute again under these conditions.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`, and the print statement outputs `1 i`.**
