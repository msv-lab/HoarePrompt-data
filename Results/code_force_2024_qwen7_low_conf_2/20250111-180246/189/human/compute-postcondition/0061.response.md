The code `print('3 1')` does not affect any variables but simply prints the string '3 1' to the console. Therefore, the only change is in the output, which is now '3 1'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, and the console output is '3 1'**
