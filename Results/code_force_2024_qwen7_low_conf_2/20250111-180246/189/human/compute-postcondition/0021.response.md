The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. It does not assign new values to `x` or `y` or any other variables. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the print statement.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing at least two pairs `(x, y)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration, `i` is `t - 2`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
