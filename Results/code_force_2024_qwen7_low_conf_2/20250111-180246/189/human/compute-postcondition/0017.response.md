Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `result`.
   - The iterable is `results`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the iterable `results` must contain at least one element. Since `results` is a list, it must not be empty.

3. **Current State Before the Loop:**
   - `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n)` for each iteration.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration.
   - `i` is `t - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `result` is used in the loop, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty for the loop to execute. Therefore, `results` should have at least one element.

Based on this reasoning, the state before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- `results` is a non-empty list (at least one element).
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration.
- `i` is `t - 1`.

Final Answer:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1***.
