The code assigns the value of `data[i + 1]` to `n`. Given that `data` is a list of strings obtained from `sys.stdin` and `i` is `k + 3`, the value of `i` is `k + 3`. Therefore, `data[i + 1]` refers to the element in the list `data` at index `k + 4`. Since `n` is converted to an integer, the value of `n` will be the integer representation of the string at index `k + 4` in the list `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is the integer value of `data[k + 4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n)` appended, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 3`**
