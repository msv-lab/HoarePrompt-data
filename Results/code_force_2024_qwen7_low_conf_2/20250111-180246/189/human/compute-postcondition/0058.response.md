The code `print('1 2')` simply prints the string '1 2' to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`**
