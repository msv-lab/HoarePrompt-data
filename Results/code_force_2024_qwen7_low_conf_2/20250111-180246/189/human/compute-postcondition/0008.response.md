Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n)`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(t)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state for the next iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - The loop will execute again if `i < t`.
   - Since `i` was incremented in the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k` before the last iteration. After the last iteration, `i` would be `k+1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be `k+2` to start the loop again.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `t` remains the same because it is the upper limit of the loop.
   - `n` remains the same because it is used as a parameter in `func_1(n)` and does not change within the loop.
   - `data` remains the same because it is obtained from `sys.stdin` before the loop starts and does not change inside the loop.
   - `results` and `result` are updated based on the function calls but do not affect the loop condition directly.

6. **Updated State**:
   - The only state that changes is `i`, which needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k+1` where `k` was the value of `i` in the previous iteration.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can simply state that `i` will be `k+1` for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k+1` where `k` was the value of `i` in the previous iteration.**
