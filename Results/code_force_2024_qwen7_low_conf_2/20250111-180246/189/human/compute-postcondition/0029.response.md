The code `print(x, y)` does not assign any new values to the variables. It simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since the initial state does not specify what `x` and `y` are, they remain unchanged. The only affected part is that the values of `x` and `y` are printed.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `result` must contain at least two elements, print(x, y)**
