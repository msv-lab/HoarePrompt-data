The code `print(f'{n} {n}')` prints the value of `n` twice but does not change the value of any variable. The other variables (`t`, `i`) remain unchanged as the print statement does not assign any new values to them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, printed output is 'n n'**
