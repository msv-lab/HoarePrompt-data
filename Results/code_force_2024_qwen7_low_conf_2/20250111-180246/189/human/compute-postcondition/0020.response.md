According to the given for loop:

```
for (x, y) in result:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

Let's break down the information given at the end of the previous iteration:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- `results` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration.
- `i` is `t - 1`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is another pair `(x, y)` in the `result` list. Since `i` is `t - 1`, it means the loop has already processed all elements in the `result` list.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, the following must be true:

- `result` should contain at least two pairs `(x, y)`.
- `i` should be set to `t - 2` because the loop starts from the beginning of the list again.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing at least two pairs `(x, y)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration, `i` is `t - 2`, and the values of `x` and `y` are yet to be printed.**
