Output State: **`results` must contain at least `i` pairs of elements, `i` is equal to the number of pairs in `results`, `x` is the last element's first value, `y` is the last element's second value, `x` and `y` are printed.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in `results`.
- Each iteration prints the values of `x` and `y`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the number of pairs in `results`.
- `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair processed by the loop.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `results` contains fewer elements than the number of iterations), the values of `x` and `y` will not be defined beyond their initial state. However, since the loop ensures that `results` must contain at least `i` pairs, this situation would imply that the loop has completed its iterations correctly.
