The code prints the value of `n` followed by the integer `2`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 2, the print statement will output `n 2`. However, the value of `n` itself does not get updated by this print statement. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, and the print statement outputs `n 2`.**
