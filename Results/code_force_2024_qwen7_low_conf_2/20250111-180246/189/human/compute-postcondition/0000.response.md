The given code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`. This means that instead of using the standard `input()` function, the program will now read the entire input as a single string. However, this does not assign a value to any variable directly; it only changes how the input function is referenced. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3; input is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
