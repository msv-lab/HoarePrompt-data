The code prints the value `1` followed by the value of `i`. Since `i` is initially `n-2` and the print statement does not change the value of `i`, the value of `i` remains `n-2`. The other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as the code only prints a value and does not assign anything to these variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-2`, and the print statement outputs `1 i`.**
