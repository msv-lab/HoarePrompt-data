The code snippet takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Before this, `n` was based on user input, and `i` was set to `n-1`. After executing the code, `n` will be updated to the integer input value, and `i` will be recalculated as `n-1`.

Since the initial value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 50, and it is not directly affected by the input, its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`**
