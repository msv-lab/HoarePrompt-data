According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in the `result` list. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- `results` is a non-empty list containing at least two pairs `(x, y)`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration.
- `i` is `t - 2`.
- The values of `x` and `y` are printed.

To determine the state needed at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop condition changes and what values need to be updated.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are pairs `(x, y)` in the `result` list. After the last iteration, one pair `(x, y)` has been processed.
2. **Values to Update**: 
   - Since one pair has been processed, the `result` list should now contain one less pair.
   - The values of `x` and `y` that were printed in the last iteration no longer matter.
   - The value of `i` does not change unless it is explicitly updated in the loop body, but it remains `t - 2` since it is not modified in the loop.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, `results`) do not change based on the loop itself.

Given these points, the updated state before the next iteration would be:

- `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
- `n` is still an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
- `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- `results` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)` (since one pair has already been processed).
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration.
- `i` is still `t - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration, `i` is `t - 2`**.
