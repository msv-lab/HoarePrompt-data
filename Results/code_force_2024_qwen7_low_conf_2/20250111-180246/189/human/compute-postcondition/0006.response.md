The code `result = func_1(n)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` with the argument `n` to the variable `result`. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. The only thing we know is that `result` is now holding the return value of `func_1(n)`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `data`, and `results`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is an empty list, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`**
