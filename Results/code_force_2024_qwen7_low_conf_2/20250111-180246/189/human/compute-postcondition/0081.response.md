Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) are inputs. For each `n`, it prints specific pairs of integers based on the value of `n`. Specifically:
- If `n` is 2, it prints '1 1' and '1 2'.
- If `n` is 3, it prints '2 1' and '2 3'.
- If `n` is 4, it prints '1 1', '1 3', '4 3', and '4 4'.
- If `n` is greater than 4, it prints a series of lines starting with '1 i' for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, followed by 'n n' and 'n 2'.

After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `t` remains unchanged (as it is not modified within the function) and `n` takes the value of the last input `n`. The variable `i` is not returned but is used within the function to determine which pairs of integers to print. There are no explicit return values from the function; its primary output is the printed pairs of integers. The function does not validate the input `t` and assumes it is within the range 1 to 50. If `t` is outside this range, the function would not process any test cases due to the loop condition.**

This summary includes the actual behavior of the function, covering all potential cases and edge scenarios as described in the code.
