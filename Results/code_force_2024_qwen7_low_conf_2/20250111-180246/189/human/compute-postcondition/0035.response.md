The given code snippet is `print(x, y)`. This line of code prints the values of `x` and `y` but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `results` must contain at least one pair of elements.
- `i` must be at least 1.

Since the code does not modify `x`, `y`, `results`, or `i`, these conditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`results` must contain at least one pair of elements; `i` must be at least 1**
