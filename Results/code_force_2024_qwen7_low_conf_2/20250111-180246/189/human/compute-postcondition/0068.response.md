Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `i` must be in the range \(1 \leq i \leq n-2\)
   - The output is '1 i'

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-2\).
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value in the range \(1 \leq i \leq n-2\).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than \(n-1\). This means that the next value of `i` should be \(i + 1\), which would be within the range \(1 \leq i+1 \leq n-2\).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as the loop condition does not depend on `n` changing.
   - The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop condition.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` is still the input integer.
   - `i` is now \(i + 1\), which means `i` must be in the range \(2 \leq i \leq n-2\) (since the next iteration would start with \(i = 1\) and increment by 1).

Therefore, the updated states are:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be in the range 2 to n-2**
