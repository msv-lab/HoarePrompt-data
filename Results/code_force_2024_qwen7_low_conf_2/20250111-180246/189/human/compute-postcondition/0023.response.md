The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the values of `x` and `y` themselves are not defined or updated by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` remain the same as they were before this line of code was executed. All other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration, `i` is `t - 2`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
