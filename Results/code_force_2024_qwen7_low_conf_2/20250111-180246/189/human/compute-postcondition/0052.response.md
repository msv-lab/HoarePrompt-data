Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is an integer based on user input, and `i` is defined as follows: if `n` equals 3, then `i` is `n-2` and the console prints '2 3'. If `n` equals 4, then the string '4 4' is printed. If `n` is 2, the console prints '3 1'. Otherwise, `i` is `n-1` and the console prints `n 2`.***
