Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute based on the given conditions:

1. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over pairs `(x, y)` from the `result` list.
   - For the loop to execute, the `result` list must contain at least one pair `(x, y)`.

2. **Given States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `results` is a non-empty list.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration.
   - `i` is `t - 1`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - Since `results` is explicitly stated as a non-empty list, we can assume that `results` will always have at least one element.
   - The variable `i` is set to `t - 1`, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute since the loop iterates over `result`.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - The key factor here is the `result` list. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration, we need to ensure that `func_1(n)` returns a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state before the loop should include the following adjustments:
- Ensure that `results` (or `result`) contains at least one pair `(x, y)`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`**
