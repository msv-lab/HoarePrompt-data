The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the values of `x` and `y` are not defined in the given code snippet. They are assumed to be previously assigned values. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the printed values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing at least one pair `(x, y)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
