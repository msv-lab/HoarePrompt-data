Output State: **`i` is the length of `results`, `result` must contain at least one element, print statement will execute and print each pair `(x, y)` in `results` exactly once.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)` in the `result` list and prints them.
- Initially, `i` is set to 0.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to the number of times the loop has iterated, which is the length of the `results` list since each pair is processed exactly once.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `result` must contain at least one element.
- Since the loop processes each pair in `result` exactly once, `i` will be the length of `results` when the loop finishes executing.

If the loop does not execute, it means `result` is an empty list, and therefore `i` remains 0.
