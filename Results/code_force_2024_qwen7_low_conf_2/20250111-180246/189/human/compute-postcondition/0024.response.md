Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing pairs `(x, y)` for each iteration of the loop, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration, `i` is `0`, and the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the elements in the `results` list, which contains pairs `(x, y)`.
- Each pair `(x, y)` is printed during each iteration.
- After all iterations, the loop variable `i` becomes `t - t = 0`.
- Since `results` is a non-empty list, it means the loop has executed `t` times, printing all pairs `(x, y)` in `results`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of the variables will be as described above.
