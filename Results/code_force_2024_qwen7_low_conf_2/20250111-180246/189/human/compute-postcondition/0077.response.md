Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 2, there is no change to `t`, `n`, and `i`. If `n` is 3, the console output is '3 1'. If `n` is 4, there is no change to `t`, `n`, and `i`, and the console output is '4 2'. For other values of `n`, the console output is 'n 2'.***
