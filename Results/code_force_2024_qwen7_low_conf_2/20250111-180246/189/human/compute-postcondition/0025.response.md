Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
   - `results` is a non-empty list containing pairs \((x, y)\) for each iteration of the loop.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)` for the current iteration.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - The values of `x` and `y` are printed.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list using the variable `result`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it involves processing each pair \((x, y)\) from the `results` list.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is `0`, it means we are starting the loop for the first time.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least one more element.
   - After processing the current element, `result` will change to the next element in the `results` list.
   - `i` will remain `0` since it is incremented only inside the loop body (not shown).

6. **Updated State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` will now be one element shorter.
   - `result` will be the next element in the `results` list.
   - `i` remains `0`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\) (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a non-empty list containing pairs `(x, y)` with one element removed, `result` is the next pair in the `results` list, `i` is 0**.
