Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is an integer input by the user, and `i` is undefined. If the loop does not execute, `t`, `n`, and `i` retain their initial values. During each iteration, the loop updates `n` based on user input, and `i` is defined according to the specific value of `n` as follows:

- If `n` is 2, the loop prints '1 1' and '1 2', and `i` is `n-2`.
- If `n` is 3, the loop prints '2 1' and '2 3', and `i` is `n-2`.
- If `n` is 4, the loop prints '1 1', '1 3', '4 3', and '4 4', and `i` is `n-2`.
- If `n` is greater than 4, the loop prints a series of lines starting with '1 i' for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-2`, followed by 'n n' and 'n 2', and `i` is `n-1`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is the last input integer, and `i` is either `n-2` if `n` is 2 or 3, or `n-1` if `n` is 4 or greater.**

This output state captures the final values and relationships of the variables after the loop has executed as many times as necessary based on user input, while also specifying the initial conditions and the possible outcomes depending on the user's inputs.
