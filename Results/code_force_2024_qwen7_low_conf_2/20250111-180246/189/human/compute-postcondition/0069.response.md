The code prints the string '1 i', where `i` is a value within the range 2 to n-2. The print statement does not assign any value to a variable but rather outputs the value of `i`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the printed value of `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be in the range 2 to n-2, printed output is '1 i'**
