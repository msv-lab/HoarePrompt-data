The code `print()` simply outputs something to the console without changing any variables. Based on the conditions given in the initial state, the value of `t`, `n`, and `i` remains unchanged, and the console output is either '3 1', '4 2', or 'n 2' depending on the value of `n`.

Since the code does not affect any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`. If `n` is 2, there is no change to `t`, `n`, and `i`. If `n` is 3, the console output is '3 1'. If `n` is 4, there is no change to `t`, `n`, and `i`, and the console output is '4 2'. For other values of `n`, the console output is 'n 2'.**
