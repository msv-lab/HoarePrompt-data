According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the length of `results`, and `results` must contain at least one element.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Length of `results`**: Since `i` is the length of `results` at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least one more element. However, since we don't know the exact number of elements, we just need to ensure it has at least one element for the next iteration.
2. **Content of `results`**: The loop iterates through each pair `(x, y)` in `results`. For the next iteration, `results` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be the new length of `results`.
- `results` must still contain at least one element for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is the new length of `results`, `results` must contain at least one element**.
