The code snippet `n = int(data[i + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[i + 1]` to the variable `n`. Here, `data` is a list of strings, and `i` is an index within the list. The value of `n` is obtained by converting the string at index `i + 1` in the list `data` into an integer. Other variables remain unchanged.

Since the exact string at index `i + 1` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `n`. However, we know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive) because of the condition `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is an empty list**
