According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `result`. For the loop to execute again, `result` must contain at least two pairs of elements because the loop iterates over each pair `(x, y)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `results` must contain at least one pair of elements, and `i` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `result` must contain at least two pairs of elements. Since `i` was at least 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` will be incremented to 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`results` must contain at least two pairs of elements, `i` is 2**
