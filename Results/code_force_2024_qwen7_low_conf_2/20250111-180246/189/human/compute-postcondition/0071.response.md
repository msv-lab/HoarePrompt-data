The code prints the string "1 i" where `i` is a value within the range 3 to n-1. However, the value of `i` itself does not get updated by this print statement; it remains within its original range. The only effect of the code is the output of the string. Therefore, the output state includes the print statement result and the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, and `i`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be in the range 3 to n-1; printed '1 i'**
