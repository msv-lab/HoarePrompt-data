The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from `sys.stdin` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The initial state includes that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\). After executing the code, `t` and `n` retain their initial values, but a new variable `data` is created which holds the split input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`**
