`results` is appended with the value of `result`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, the updated state includes `results` containing this return value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(n)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`**
