Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is `n-2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-2`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must increment by 1 to become `n-1`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` would be `n-1`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` was `n-2` at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be `n-1` for the next iteration.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as the loop condition does not modify `n`.
   - There is no mention of `t` being modified within the loop, so `t` remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is `n-1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`**.
