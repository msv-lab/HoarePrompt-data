According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute again, the list must have at least 3 pairs of elements because it needs to iterate over each pair in the list.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `results` must contain at least two pairs of elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is its original value.
- `y` is its original value.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` will be 3.
- Since the loop iterates over pairs, `x` and `y` will be set to the next pair in the list.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `results` must have at least 3 pairs of elements. After processing the first 2 pairs, `results` must have at least one more pair to continue the loop.

State: **`results` must contain at least three pairs of elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the next element's first value, `y` is the next element's second value**
