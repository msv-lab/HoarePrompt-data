The code snippet `print('2 1')` simply prints the string '2 1' to the console. It does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`**
