The code `print(f'{n} {n}')` prints the value of `n` twice. However, the code does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `t`. It only outputs the value of `n`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `i` is `n-1`
- The print statement outputs `1 {i}` (which means `i` was initially set to `n-1` and the print statement is printing `1 (n-1)`)

Since the print statement only outputs `n` twice and does not modify `n`, `i`, or `t`, the values remain unchanged. The output of the print statement will be `n n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, and the print statement outputs `n n`.**
