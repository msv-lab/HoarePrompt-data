The code `print(f'1 {i}')` prints the string `1 i` where `i` is an integer in the range 1 to n-2. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does print the value of `i`. The output of the print statement is not stored in any variable, so the values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be in the range 1 to n-2, the output is '1 i'**
