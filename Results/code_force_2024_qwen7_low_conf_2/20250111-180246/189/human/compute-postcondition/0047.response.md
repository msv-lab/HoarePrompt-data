The code `print(f'1 {i}')` prints the string `'1 {i}'`. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`. The output state is the same as the initial state with the additional print statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, the output is '1 {i}'**
