The given code simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the initial values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. Since these values are not specified, they remain unchanged. The variables `results` and `i` are also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`results` must contain at least two pairs of elements, `i` is 2, `x` is its original value, `y` is its original value**
