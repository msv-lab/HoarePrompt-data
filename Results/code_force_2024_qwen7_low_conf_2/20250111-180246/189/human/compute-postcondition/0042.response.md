The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it appears to handle multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it processes an integer `n` such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`, and a positive integer `t` such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`. However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, we can only describe what it does in terms of its internal behavior based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a range defined by `t` and processes each `n` within the specified range, but without any parameters, we cannot specify the exact return value. The function's behavior is more about handling multiple test cases rather than returning a single value.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it handles an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), but it does not accept any parameters directly and does not have a specific return value described in the provided function signature.**
