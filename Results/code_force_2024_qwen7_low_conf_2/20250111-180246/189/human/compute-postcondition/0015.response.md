The code appends the value of `result` to the `results` list. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, the `results` list will now contain this value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is the integer value of `data[k + 4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n)` appended, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 3`, `results` is `[result]`**
