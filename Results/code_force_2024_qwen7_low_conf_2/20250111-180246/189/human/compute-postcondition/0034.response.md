Let's break down the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop is iterating over pairs `(x, y)` from the `results` list.
   - The key variables here are `results`, `x`, `y`, and the loop variable `(x, y)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `results` that can be unpacked into `(x, y)` pairs.
   - This means that `results` must contain at least one pair of elements.

3. **Analyze the Given State:**
   - The state before the loop starts is: `i` is the new length of `results`, and `results` must contain at least one element.
     - Here, `i` is the length of `results`.

4. **Determine the Required Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop requires `results` to have at least one pair of elements, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one such pair.
   - Given that `i` is the new length of `results`, `i` should be at least 1 (to ensure `results` has at least one pair).

5. **Finalize the State:**
   - `results` must contain at least one pair of elements.
   - `i` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is at least 1, results must contain at least one pair of elements**
