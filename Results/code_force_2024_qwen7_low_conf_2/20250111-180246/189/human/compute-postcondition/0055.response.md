Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` is an integer based on user input.
   - `i` is defined as follows:
     - If `n` equals 2, then `i` is `n-2` (which is 0) and the console prints '3 1'.
     - If `n` equals 3, then `i` is `n-2` (which is 1) and the console prints '2 3'.
     - If `n` equals 4, then the console prints '4 4'.
     - Otherwise (`n > 4`), `i` is `n-1` and the console prints `n 2`.
   - Additionally, '1 1' is printed to the console if `n` is 2, and '1 2' is printed to the console in all other cases. An empty line is printed to the console.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `n_` times, where `n_` is the value of `n` from the initial state.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` remains unchanged: \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `n` remains the same as the initial `n`.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1` because the loop increments `i` each time it runs.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Possible Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - If `n` equals 2:
     - `i` starts as 0 and increases to 1 (prints '3 1', '1 1', and an empty line).
     - After the first iteration, `i` is 1, and the loop does not execute again.
   - If `n` equals 3:
     - `i` starts as 1 and increases to 2 (prints '2 3', '1 2', and an empty line).
     - After the first iteration, `i` is 2, and the loop does not execute again.
   - If `n` equals 4:
     - `i` starts as 3 and increases to 4 (prints '4 4', '1 2', and an empty line).
     - After the first iteration, `i` is 4, and the loop does not execute again.
   - If `n > 4`:
     - `i` starts as `n-1` and increases to `n` (prints `n 2`, '1 2', and an empty line).
     - After the first iteration, `i` is `n`, and the loop does not execute again.

6. **General Case for `n > 4`**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be `n-1`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `t` remains unchanged: \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` remains the same as the initial `n`.
- `i` must be `n-1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is an integer based on user input, `i` is \(n-1\)**.
