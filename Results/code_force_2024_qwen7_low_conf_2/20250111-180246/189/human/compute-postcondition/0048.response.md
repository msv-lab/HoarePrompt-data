Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, and the print statement outputs `1 {i}`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `n` is an integer based on user input, and `i` is `n-2` if `n` is not 2 and not 3.
2. **Loop Code**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.
3. **Output State Analysis**:
   - After the loop executes 1 time: `i` becomes `n-1` because the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. Therefore, after 1 iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - After the loop executes 2 times: `i` again becomes `n-1` because the loop continues to iterate until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - After the loop executes 3 times: `i` remains `n-1` because the loop continues to run until `i` reaches `n-1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop will execute until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - The print statement will output `1 {i}` each time the loop iterates, and since `i` is `n-1` after the loop completes, the final print statement will be `1 {n-1}`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations is as described above.
