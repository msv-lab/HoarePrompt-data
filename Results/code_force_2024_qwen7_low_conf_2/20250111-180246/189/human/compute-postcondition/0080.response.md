The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. The constraints indicate that there are two variables involved: `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. However, these variables are not passed as arguments to the function. 

Based on the provided output cases, the function likely processes these variables internally. Given the structure of the example answer, the function seems to handle multiple test cases and return different values based on the conditions provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes two internal variables `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). It returns different values based on the conditions: returns an error message if `t` is less than 1 or greater than 50, and returns a specific value based on the relationship between `t` and `n` for valid `t` and `n` values.**
