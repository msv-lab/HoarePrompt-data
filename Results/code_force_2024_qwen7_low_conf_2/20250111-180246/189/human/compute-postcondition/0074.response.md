The code `print(f'{n} 2')` prints the value of `n` followed by the number `2`. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `i`. However, it does print the value of `n` followed by `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50
- `n` is an input integer
- `i` is `n-1`
- Printed output is 'n n'

After executing the code, the printed output changes from `'n n'` to `'n 2'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50; `n` is an input integer; `i` is `n-1`; printed output is 'n 2'**
