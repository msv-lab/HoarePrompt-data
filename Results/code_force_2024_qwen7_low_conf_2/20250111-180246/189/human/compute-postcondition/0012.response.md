Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\).
- `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\).
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n)` appended.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values at the Start of the Loop:**
   - `t` remains the same throughout the loop as it is defined outside the loop.
   - `n` remains the same throughout the loop as it is defined outside the loop.
   - `data` remains the same throughout the loop as it is defined outside the loop.
   - `results` and `result` are updated inside the loop but their values do not affect the loop condition.
   - `i` starts from `k + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates based on the range of `i` in `range(t)`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` was `k + 1` at the start of the loop.
   - After one iteration, `i` becomes `k + 2`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` starts from `k + 1`, after the first iteration, `i` is `k + 2`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `k + 3` (which is still less than `t`).

### Adjusted States:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n`, `data`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged.
- `i` is increased by 1 from `k + 2` to `k + 3`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^3\), `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `results` is a list with the return value of `func_1(n)` appended, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n)`, `i` is `k + 3`**
