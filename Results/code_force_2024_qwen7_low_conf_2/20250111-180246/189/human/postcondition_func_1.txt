The function processes multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from standard input. It then calls `func_1(n)` for each test case and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1(n)` for every test case. The function does not accept any parameters directly and does not have a specific return value. However, it ensures that the input `t` is within the range 1 to 50 and `n` is within the range 2 to 10^3. If `t` exceeds 50 or `n` is outside the specified range, the function will not handle these cases explicitly, but the behavior of `func_1(n)` may vary.
