Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly generates a set of points that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). For each test case, the `func_1` function generates a sequence of points based on the value of \(n\). The `func_2` function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

To verify this, let's analyze the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates a set of points such that the Manhattan distances between them are maximized.
   - For \(n = 2\), the function returns points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), resulting in distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the function returns points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), resulting in distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
   - For \(n = 4\), the function returns points that generate distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
   - For \(n = 5\), the function returns points that generate distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
   - For \(n = 6\), the function returns points that generate distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the points for each case.

Since the program generates the correct set of points for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for various values of \(n\) and handles multiple test cases correctly, the program is correct.
