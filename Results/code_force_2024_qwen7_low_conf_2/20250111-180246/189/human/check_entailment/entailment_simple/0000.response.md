Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to place \( n \) points on an \( n \times n \) grid to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances between any two points. 

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - **`func_1(n)`**: This function generates \( n \) points on the grid according to the formula \((i + 1, i \cdot 2 \% n + 1)\). This ensures that each point is uniquely placed, and the points cover a wide range of Manhattan distances.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the input value \( n \), calls `func_1(n)` to get the points, and prints these points.

3. **Function Execution Flow**:
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - Reads the input and splits it into a list of strings.
     - Iterates over each test case, extracting \( n \) from the input.
     - Calls `func_1(n)` to generate the points for each test case.
     - Appends the result of `func_1(n)` to `results`.
     - Prints the points generated by `func_1(n)` for each test case.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program assumes valid input as specified in the problem description. It expects \( t \) test cases, each followed by an integer \( n \).

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the points for each test case in the required format without unnecessary newlines between test cases.

6. **Maximizing Unique Distances**:
   - The points generated by `func_1(n)` ensure that the Manhattan distances are maximized. By placing points at specific intervals (as defined by the formula), the program ensures a diverse set of distances.

Given the above points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
