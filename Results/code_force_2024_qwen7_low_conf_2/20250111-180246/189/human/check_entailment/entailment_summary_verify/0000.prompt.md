You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        x = i + 1
        y = i * 2 % n + 1
        points.append((x, y))
    return points

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(data[i + 1])
        result = func_1(n)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        for (x, y) in result:
            print(x, y)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) from standard input. It then calls `func_1(n)` for each test case and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1(n)` for every test case. The function does not accept any parameters directly and does not have a specific return value. However, it ensures that the input `t` is within the range 1 to 50 and `n` is within the range 2 to 10^3. If `t` exceeds 50 or `n` is outside the specified range, the function will not handle these cases explicitly, but the behavior of `func_1(n)` may vary.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly generates a set of points that maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). For each test case, the `func_1` function generates a sequence of points based on the value of \(n\). The `func_2` function reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

To verify this, let's analyze the logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates a set of points such that the Manhattan distances between them are maximized.
   - For \(n = 2\), the function returns points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), resulting in distances \(\{0, 1\}\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the function returns points \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), resulting in distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
   - For \(n = 4\), the function returns points that generate distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
   - For \(n = 5\), the function returns points that generate distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).
   - For \(n = 6\), the function returns points that generate distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the points for each case.

Since the program generates the correct set of points for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for various values of \(n\) and handles multiple test cases correctly, the program is correct.
