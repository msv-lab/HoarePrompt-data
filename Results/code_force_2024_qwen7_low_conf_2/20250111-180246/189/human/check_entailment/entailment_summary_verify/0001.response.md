Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances between pairs of points in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - This function generates points such that for each \(i\), the coordinates \((x, y)\) are calculated as \(x = i + 1\) and \(y = i \cdot 2 \mod n + 1\).
   - The function returns a list of these points.
3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases \(t\) and subsequent lines contain the value of \(n\) for each test case.
   - For each \(n\), it calls `func_1` to generate the points and appends the result to `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the points for each test case.
4. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the correctness of `func_1` for different values of \(n\):
     - For \(n = 2\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
       - Distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
     - For \(n = 3\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\)
       - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
     - For \(n = 4\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\)
       - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
     - For \(n = 5\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\)
       - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
     - For \(n = 6\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\)
       - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)

From the above analysis, we can see that `func_1` generates points that form a diagonal line across the grid, ensuring a wide range of Manhattan distances. This approach is indeed effective for generating points that maximize the number of unique distances.

However, let's consider a counterexample to ensure the distribution truly maximizes the number of unique distances for all \(n\):

- For \(n = 4\):
  - Using the function's approach: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\)
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
- An alternative distribution: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 2)\), \((4, 3)\)
  - Distances: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)

This alternative distribution provides a higher number of unique distances. Therefore, `func_1` does not always generate the optimal set of points to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances.

Given this counterexample, the function's approach is not guaranteed to be optimal for all \(n\).

Final: **False**
