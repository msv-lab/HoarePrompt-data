Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances between pairs of points in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - This function generates points such that for each \(i\), the coordinates \((x, y)\) are calculated as \(x = i + 1\) and \(y = i \cdot 2 \mod n + 1\).
   - The function returns a list of these points.
3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases \(t\) and subsequent lines contain the value of \(n\) for each test case.
   - For each \(n\), it calls `func_1` to generate the points and appends the result to `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the points for each test case.
4. **Verification**:
   - The key to maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances lies in how the points are distributed across the grid. The distribution used in `func_1` ensures that the points are spread out enough to maximize the variety of distances.
   - For example, for \(n = 2\), the points generated are \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\), resulting in a Manhattan distance of 1.
   - For \(n = 3\), the points generated are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\), resulting in a set of Manhattan distances \(\{0, 2, 3\}\).

Given the nature of the distribution and the examples provided, the function appears to correctly maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
