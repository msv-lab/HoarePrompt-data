Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)) and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple is of the form \((i+1, i*2 \% n + 1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - This means for each \(i\), the x-coordinate is \(i + 1\) and the y-coordinate is calculated as \(i * 2 \% n + 1\).
   - The calculation ensures that the y-coordinates are distributed across the grid in a way that maximizes the number of unique Manhattan distances.
   - The function correctly generates the required points without any edge cases mentioned that would alter its behavior.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
   - It calls `func_1(n)` for each test case and collects the results in a list.
   - Finally, it prints each pair `(x, y)` returned by `func_1(n)` for every test case.
   - The function ensures that `t` is within the range 1 to 50 and `n` is within the range 2 to 10^3. If `t` exceeds 50 or `n` is outside the specified range, the function will not handle these cases explicitly, but the behavior of `func_1(n)` may vary, which does not affect the correctness of the function under the given constraints.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the points using `func_1(n)` and prints them out.
   - The approach used in `func_1` is known to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for any \(n\) in the given range.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem statement and requirements.

Given the analysis, the program is designed to solve the problem correctly and efficiently for the specified constraints.
