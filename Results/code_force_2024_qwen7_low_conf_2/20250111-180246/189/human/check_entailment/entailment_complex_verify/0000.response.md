### Reasoning

Let's carefully review the given program and the original assessment, using the provided annotations to ensure accuracy.

#### Function `func_1`

The function `func_1` is responsible for generating points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for a given \(n\).

1. **Logic Analysis**:
   - For each \(i\) in the range \(0\) to \(n-1\):
     - `x = i + 1`: The \(x\)-coordinate starts from 1 and increments by 1 for each point.
     - `y = i * 2 % n + 1`: The \(y\)-coordinate is calculated as \(2i \mod n + 1\). This ensures that the \(y\)-coordinates cycle through values from 1 to \(n\) in a specific pattern.
   - This results in points \((x, y)\) where \(x\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(y\) cycles through values from 1 to \(n\) in a specific order.

2. **Examples**:
   - For \(n = 2\):
     - Points generated: \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - Distances: \(\{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|\} = \{0, 0\}\) and \(\{|1-1| + |1-2|\} = \{1\}\).
     - Distinct distances: \(\{0, 1\}\).
   - For \(n = 3\):
     - Points generated: \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\).
     - Distances: \(\{|2-2| + |1-1|, |2-2| + |3-3|, |3-3| + |1-1|\} = \{0, 0, 0\}\) and \(\{|2-2| + |1-3|, |2-3| + |1-1|, |2-3| + |3-1|\} = \{2, 1, 3\}\}.
     - Distinct distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

3. **Generalization**:
   - The function ensures that the points are distributed such that the Manhattan distances cover a wide range of values, effectively maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

#### Function `func_2`

The function `func_2` processes the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case.
2. **Processing**:
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results in a list.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

#### Overall Evaluation

- The function `func_1` correctly generates points that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each \(n\).
- The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and prints the results for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and the examples provided, the program behaves as expected and generates the correct set of points for each test case.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct as it generates the appropriate points for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case and handles multiple test cases correctly.
