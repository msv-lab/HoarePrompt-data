### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances between pairs of points in an \(n \times n\) grid.
   - The goal is to distribute the points in such a way that the set of all possible Manhattan distances between them is maximized.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` generates points such that for each \(i\), the coordinates \((x, y)\) are calculated as \(x = i + 1\) and \(y = i \cdot 2 \mod n + 1\).
   - This means the \(x\)-coordinates range from 1 to \(n\) and the \(y\)-coordinates are determined by a specific formula that ensures they are spread out but not necessarily optimally for maximizing unique distances.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases \(t\) and subsequent lines contain the value of \(n\) for each test case.
   - For each \(n\), it calls `func_1` to generate the points and appends the result to `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the points for each test case.

4. **Verification**:
   - Let's examine the distribution method in `func_1` more closely:
     - For \(n = 2\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\) and \((2, 2)\)
       - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1\}\) (Correct, as given)
     - For \(n = 3\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\)
       - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) (Correct, as given)
     - For \(n = 4\):
       - Points generated: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 1)\)
       - Unique Manhattan distances: \(\{0, 2, 3\}\) (Incorrect, should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\))

5. **Optimality Analysis**:
   - The given distribution in `func_1` does not always produce the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances for all \(n\). For instance, when \(n = 4\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 1)\) do not produce all possible distances from 0 to 4. Instead, the actual optimal solution would involve points like \((1, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((4, 3)\), which yield \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the provided distribution works for small values of \(n\), it fails to produce the maximum number of unique distances for larger values of \(n\). Therefore, the given function does not always maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not always correctly maximize the number of unique Manhattan distances between pairs of points in an \(n \times n\) grid.
