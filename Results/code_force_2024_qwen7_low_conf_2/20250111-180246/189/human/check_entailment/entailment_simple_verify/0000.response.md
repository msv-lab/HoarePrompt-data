### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
- **Logic**: The function `func_1` generates a list of points such that the Manhattan distances between them are maximized.
  - For each \(i\) in the range \(0 \leq i < n\), it calculates the coordinates as follows:
    - \(x = i + 1\)
    - \(y = i * 2 \% n + 1\)
  
  This means the points generated are \((1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5), \ldots\).

- **Example Calculations**:
  - For \(n = 2\): Points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 3 \mod 2 + 1) = (1, 1)\). But since \(y = i * 2 \% n + 1\) should wrap around, it actually gives \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 3 \mod 2 + 1) = (1, 1)\) again, but logically, it should give \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
  - For \(n = 3\): Points are \((1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5 \mod 3 + 1) = (3, 2)\).
  - For \(n = 4\): Points are \((1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5 \mod 4 + 1) = (3, 2), (4, 7 \mod 4 + 1) = (4, 3)\).

- **Manhattan Distances Calculation**:
  - For \(n = 2\): Distances are \(\{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|\} = \{0, 0\}\), but the actual distinct distances should be \(\{0, 1\}\).
  - For \(n = 3\): Distances are \(\{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |3-3|, |2-2| + |3-3|, |2-2| + |3-2|, |3-2| + |1-1|, |3-2| + |3-3|\} = \{0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 3\}\), but the actual distinct distances should be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

- **Conclusion**: The function does not correctly generate points that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). It fails to cover all possible distances efficiently.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
- **Input Reading and Processing**: 
  - `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case using `func_1`.
  - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

- **Example Execution**:
  - Given the input:
    ```
    5
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    ```
  - The expected output for each \(n\) should cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances up to \(n - 1\).

- **Conclusion**: While `func_2` correctly processes and prints the results, the points generated by `func_1` do not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for some \(n\).

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly generate points that maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

**Final: False**
