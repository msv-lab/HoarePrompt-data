The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\) and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple in the list is of the form \((i+1, i*2 \% n + 1)\) for \(0 \leq i < n\). After the loop finishes, the variable `i` will be equal to \(n-1\). There are no edge cases mentioned that would change this behavior, and the code correctly implements the described functionality.
