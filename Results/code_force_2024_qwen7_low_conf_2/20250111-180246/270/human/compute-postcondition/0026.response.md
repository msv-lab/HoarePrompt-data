`s` is updated by appending `'')'` to the existing list. The values of the other variables (`q`, `pc`, `u`, and `s`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is the list after appending `(1, u)` and extending it with tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`; `pc` is the first element of the popped item; `u` is the second element of the popped item; `s` is the list with an additional element `'('` and an additional element `'')'`.**
