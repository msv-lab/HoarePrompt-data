Step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial State:
   - `q` is the list after appending `(1, u)`
   - `pc` is the first element of the popped item
   - `u` is the second element of the popped item
   - `s` is the list with an additional element `'('`

2. Code Execution:
   - The code `q.extend((0, v) for v in u)` iterates over each element `v` in `u` and appends the tuple `(0, v)` to the list `q`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `q` is updated by extending itself with tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`.
   - `pc` remains unchanged.
   - `u` remains unchanged.
   - `s` remains unchanged.

4. Calculation of Result:
   - Since `u` is the second element of the popped item, let's assume `u` is a sequence (e.g., a list). For example, if `u = [a, b, c]`, then `q` would be extended by `[0, a], [0, b], [0, c]`.
   - The new value of `q` will be the original `q` plus the tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`q` is the list after appending `(1, u)` and extending it with tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`; `pc` is the first element of the popped item; `u` is the second element of the popped item; `s` is the list with an additional element `'('`.**
