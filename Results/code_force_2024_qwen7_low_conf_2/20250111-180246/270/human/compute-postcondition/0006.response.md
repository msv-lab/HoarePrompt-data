The code `q.append((1, u))` appends a tuple `(1, u)` to the list `q`. Given the initial state:
- `u` is the string resulting from popping the last character from `q`.
- `pc` is the last character popped from `q` and its value is `0`.
- `q` is the list `q` with its last element removed.
- `s` is a list with an additional element `(` appended to it.

After executing the code:
- `u` remains unchanged as it was popped before appending the tuple.
- `pc` remains `0` as it is not affected by the append operation.
- `q` is updated by appending the tuple `(1, u)`.
- `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the append operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `u` is the string resulting from popping the last character from `q`; `pc` is `0`; `q` is the list `q` with its last element removed plus the tuple `(1, u)`; `s` is a list with an additional element `(` appended to it.
Output State: **`u` is the string resulting from popping the last character from `q`; `pc` is `0`; `q` is the list `q` with its last element removed plus the tuple `(1, u)'; `s` is a list with an additional element `(` appended to it.**
