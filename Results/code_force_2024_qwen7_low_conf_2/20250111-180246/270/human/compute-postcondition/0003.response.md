`pc` and `u` are assigned the values from `q.pop()`. The `pop` method removes and returns the last item in the list `q`. Since the exact content of `q` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `pc` and `u` after the operation. However, we know that `u` originally consisted only of the characters "(", and ")" and was a non-empty string.

Output State: **`u` is now the string resulting from popping the last character from `q`, `pc` is the last character popped from `q`, and `q` is the list `q` with its last element removed.**
