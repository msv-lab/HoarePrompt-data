Postcondition: ***`q` is a list where the last element has been modified from (1, u) to a series of tuples (0, v) for each v in `u`; `pc` and `u` remain unchanged; `s` is a list with its last element being ')' appended to it, provided that `pc == 1`. Otherwise, `q`, `pc`, `u`, and `s` remain as they were initially.***
