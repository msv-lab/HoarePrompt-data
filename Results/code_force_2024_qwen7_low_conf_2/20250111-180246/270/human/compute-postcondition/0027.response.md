Postcondition: ***`q` is the list after appending `(1, u)` and extending it with tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u`. `pc` is the first element of the popped item; `u` is the second element of the popped item; `s` is the list with an additional element `'('` and an additional element `')'`. If `pc` equals 1, `s` will have an additional element `')'`.***
