The code `q.extend((0, v) for v in u)` appends tuples `(0, v)` for each `v` in `u` to the list `q`. Since `u` is unchanged, its elements remain the same. The last element of `q` was originally `(1, u)`, and now additional tuples `(0, v)` are added for each `v` in `u`.

Let's assume the initial state of `q` is something like `[... (1, u)]`. After executing the code, each `v` in `u` will add a tuple `(0, v)` to `q`. The value of `pc` remains unchanged, and `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is a list with its last element previously (1, u) and now followed by tuples (0, v) for each v in u; `pc` and `u` are unchanged; `s` is unchanged**
