`q` is a list after popping one item, which means `q` has one less item than before. The popped item had its first element stored in `pc` and its second element stored in `u`. The code appends a tuple `(1, u)` to `q`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `q` is the list after appending `(1, u)`, `pc` is the first element of the popped item, `u` is the second element of the popped item, `s` is the list with an additional element `'('`.

Output State: **`q` is the list after appending `(1, u)`, `pc` is the first element of the popped item, `u` is the second element of the popped item, `s` is the list with an additional element `'('`**.
