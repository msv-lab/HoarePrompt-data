You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The only difference with the medium version is the maximum length of the
input.

A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced
parentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will
omit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of
two different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore
the balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced
parentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced
parentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given
sequence.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t
is equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.

Example

Input

    ()(()())
    
Output

    (()(()))

- Program:
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        (pc, u) = q.pop()
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend(((0, v) for v in u))
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
    return ''.join(s)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `u` consisting of balanced parentheses and performs a depth-first traversal to reorder the parentheses. It uses a stack `s` to collect the parentheses in the correct order. After the traversal, it returns a string containing all the correctly ordered parentheses. The function ensures that the input string `u` is processed to produce a valid sequence of parentheses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, let's break down the problem and the solution step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Balanced Shuffle Operation**:
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the prefix balance for each character in the input sequence.
   - These balances are used to construct a new sequence where the characters are ordered based on their prefix balance, breaking ties by position.
   - The resulting sequence is guaranteed to be a balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Reversing the Balanced Shuffle**:
   - The problem requires finding the original sequence `t` from which the given sequence `s` was derived through the balanced shuffle operation.
   - To reverse the shuffle, we need to reconstruct the structure of the original sequence based on the prefix balances and positions.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code uses an iterative approach to build the nested list structure `q` that represents the prefix balances and positions.
   - The `func_1` function reconstructs the original sequence by iterating over the nested list `u` and appending parentheses based on the prefix balance and position information.

Let's walk through the code to ensure it correctly reverses the balanced shuffle operation:

- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  s = input()
  q = [[]]
  it = iter(q)
  cur = next(it)
  for c in s:
      if c == '(':
          x = []
          cur.append(x)
          q.append(x)
      if c == ')':
          cur = next(it)
  ```
  This part constructs a nested list structure `q` that mirrors the prefix balance and positions during the shuffle process.

- **Reconstructing the Original Sequence**:
  ```python
  def func_1(u):
      q = [(0, v) for v in u]
      s = []
      while q:
          (pc, u) = q.pop()
          if pc == 0:
              s.append('(')
              q.append((1, u))
              q.extend(((0, v) for v in u))
          if pc == 1:
              s.append(')')
      return ''.join(s)
  ```

  - The `func_1` function initializes a queue `q` with tuples containing the prefix balance (`pc`) and sublists (`u`).
  - It iterates over the queue, appending `'('` when the prefix balance is 0 and `')'` when the prefix balance is 1.
  - This process reconstructs the original sequence by following the structure stored in the nested list `q`.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the balanced shuffle operation, the code appears to correctly reverse the shuffle by constructing the original sequence from the given sequence.
