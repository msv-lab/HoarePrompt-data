You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The only difference with the medium version is the maximum length of the
input.

A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

Surprisingly, it turns out that the balanced shuffle of any balanced
parentheses sequence is always another balanced parentheses sequence (we will
omit the proof for brevity). Even more surprisingly, the balanced shuffles of
two different balanced parentheses sequences are always different, therefore
the balanced shuffle operation is a bijection on the set of balanced
parentheses sequences of any given length (we will omit this proof, too).

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Find its preimage: the balanced
parentheses sequence the balanced shuffle of which is equal to the given
sequence.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the balanced parentheses sequence t such that the balanced shuffle of t
is equal to s . It is guaranteed that the answer always exists and is unique.

Example

Input

    ()(()())
    
Output

    (()(()))

- Program: 
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        (pc, u) = q.pop()
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend(((0, v) for v in u))
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
    return ''.join(s)



- Annotated Code: 
s = input()
q = [[]]
it = iter(q)
cur = next(it)
for c in s:
    if c == '(':
        x = []
        cur.append(x)
        q.append(x)
    if c == ')':
        cur = next(it)
print(func_1(q[0]))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: u is a string consisting only of characters "(", and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(u):
    q = [(0, v) for v in u]
    s = []
    while q:
        pc, u = q.pop()
        
        if pc == 0:
            s.append('(')
            q.append((1, u))
            q.extend((0, v) for v in u)
        
        if pc == 1:
            s.append(')')
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is an empty list, `s` is a list containing all the parentheses in the correct order based on the characters in `u`
    return ''.join(s)
    #The program returns an empty string since 's' is a list containing all the correctly ordered parentheses based on the characters in 'u', and 's' is initially a list of parentheses in the correct order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `u` consisting of balanced parentheses and performs a depth-first traversal to reorder the parentheses. It uses a stack `s` to collect the parentheses in the correct order. After the traversal, it returns a string containing all the correctly ordered parentheses. The function ensures that the input string `u` is processed to produce a valid sequence of parentheses.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue.

### Example
**Input:**
```
()(()())
```

**Expected Output:**
```
(()(()))
```

**Actual Output:**
The program attempts to use a nested structure to represent the sequence and then reconstructs it, but it fails to correctly handle the balancing and reordering of characters as required by the balanced shuffle operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program is doing:

1. It reads the input string `s`.
2. It initializes a nested list structure `q` and iterates over the characters in `s`.
3. When it encounters an opening parenthesis `(`, it appends a new sublist to the current list.
4. When it encounters a closing parenthesis `)`, it moves to the next sublist in the stack.

However, the program does not correctly track the balance and reordering of characters as specified. Specifically, it does not maintain the correct balance of opening and closing parentheses as it constructs the nested lists.

### Issue
The program fails to correctly reorder the characters based on their prefix balances. Instead, it simply appends sublists without ensuring the final sequence has the correct balanced shuffle.

### Test Case
Consider the input `()(()())`. The correct balanced shuffle is `(()(()))`, but the program does not produce this output. The program's approach to using nested lists and iterating over the characters does not correctly reflect the logic needed to perform the balanced shuffle operation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
