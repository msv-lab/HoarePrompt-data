#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 30. Each magic word generated is a string of length between 1 and 30 * n, inclusive, consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
def func_1(n):
    magic_words = []
    for _ in range(n):
        length = random.randint(1, 30 * n)
        
        word = ''.join(random.choice(['X', 'O']) for _ in range(length))
        
        magic_words.append(word)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `magic_words` is a list containing `n` elements, each element is a string of length between 1 and 30 * `n` inclusive consisting of randomly chosen characters 'X' or 'O', `length` is the last random integer generated between 1 and 30 * `n` inclusive, `word` is the last string of length `length` consisting of randomly chosen characters 'X' or 'O'.
    return magic_words
    #`The program returns a list named 'magic_words' containing 'n' elements, each element is a string of length between 1 and 30 * n inclusive consisting of randomly chosen characters 'X' or 'O'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, which must satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq 30\). It generates a list named `magic_words` containing `n` elements, where each element is a string of length between 1 and \(30 \times n\) (inclusive) consisting of randomly chosen characters 'X' or 'O'. After executing the function, the program returns this list `magic_words`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code correctly implements the described behavior. The function ensures that each string in the list has a valid length and consists only of the characters 'X' or 'O'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and the length of s is at least 1 and at most 30 * n, where n is the number of magic words created initially.
def func_2(s):
    substrings = set()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substrings.add(s[i:j])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `substrings` is a set containing all possible substrings of `s`, `i` is `len(s)`, `j` is `len(s) + 1`.
    return len(substrings)
    #The program returns the length of the set 'substrings', which contains all possible substrings of 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and returns the number of unique substrings contained within `s`. It achieves this by iterating over all possible substrings of `s` and storing them in a set called `substrings`. The function then returns the size of this set. This approach ensures that even if there are duplicate substrings, only one instance of each substring is counted. The function handles strings of lengths ranging from 1 to 30 * n, where n is the number of initial magic words. Potential edge cases include empty strings (though the problem statement implies `s` has a minimum length of 1), and strings containing only one character.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: magic_words is a list of strings representing the n distinct magic words created by the program, each consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and power is an integer representing the power of a spell as given by a student.
def func_3(magic_words, power):
    for i in range(len(magic_words)):
        for j in range(len(magic_words)):
            spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]
            if func_2(spell) == power:
                return i + 1, j + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is the final value of the index `i` after all iterations, `j + 1` is the final value of the index `j` after all iterations, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` after the last iteration if a valid spell is found, otherwise `spell` remains unchanged, and the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` if a valid spell is found, otherwise the function returns `None`.
    return -1, -1
    #The program returns (-1, -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power` as inputs. It iterates through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenating them to form a spell. For each spell, it checks if the result of calling `func_2(spell)` equals `power`. If such a pair is found, the function returns the indices `i + 1` and `j + 1` corresponding to the positions of the strings in `magic_words`. If no valid pair is found, the function returns `(-1, -1)`.
