The function `func_2` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters 'X' and 'O', and returns the number of unique substrings contained within `s`. It achieves this by iterating over all possible substrings of `s` and storing them in a set called `substrings`. The function then returns the size of this set. This approach ensures that even if there are duplicate substrings, only one instance of each substring is counted. The function handles strings of lengths ranging from 1 to 30 * n, where n is the number of initial magic words. Potential edge cases include empty strings (though the problem statement implies `s` has a minimum length of 1), and strings containing only one character.
