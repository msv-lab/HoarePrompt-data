The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as a parameter, which must satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq 30\). It generates a list named `magic_words` containing `n` elements, where each element is a string of length between 1 and \(30 \times n\) (inclusive) consisting of randomly chosen characters 'X' or 'O'. After executing the function, the program returns this list `magic_words`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the provided code correctly implements the described behavior. The function ensures that each string in the list has a valid length and consists only of the characters 'X' or 'O'.
