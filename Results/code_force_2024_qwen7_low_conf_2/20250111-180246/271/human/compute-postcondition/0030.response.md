According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `len(magic_words) - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i + 1` is incremented by 1 for each iteration.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]` for each iteration.
- `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` for each iteration.
- If `func_2(spell) == power`, then the function returns the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (None).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the following:
- The value of `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The value of `j` remains in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- `spell` will be recalculated based on the new values of `i` and `j`.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i + 1` minus 1. Let's denote the current value of `i + 1` as `k`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `k - 1`.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i + 1` will be `k + 1`.

At the start of the next iteration, the state should be:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i + 1` is `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`**
