The code `spell = magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` concatenates the string at index `i` and the string at index `j` in the list `magic_words`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, `magic_words`, or `k`. The output state remains as described in the precondition.

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 2]`, `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` where `i + 1` is `k + 1` and `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 2]`.**
