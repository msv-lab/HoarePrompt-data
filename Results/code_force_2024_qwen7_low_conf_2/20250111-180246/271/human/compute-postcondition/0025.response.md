According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i + 1` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`.
- If `func_2(spell) == power`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still remain within the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since `j` was in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]` at the end of the previous iteration, incrementing `j` by 1 should still keep it within this range unless `len(magic_words)` is only 1 and `j` was already at its maximum value (which would be 0).
2. The other variables (`magic_words`, `i + 1`, `spell`) do not change directly by the loop itself, but their values depend on the loop condition and the logic inside the loop.

Given that `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and still be within the valid range, we need to ensure `j` is still in bounds. If `j` reaches the length of `magic_words` (i.e., `len(magic_words)`), the loop will stop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i + 1` is incremented by 1.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, but incremented by 1.
- `spell` will be recalculated as `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` with the updated `j`.

Since the exact value of `j` after incrementation cannot be determined without the actual list size, we can represent the new state as follows:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is incremented by 1, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]` and is incremented by 1, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` with the updated `j`**.
