According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `magic_words`. If `j` is less than the length of `magic_words`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `j` is 0, `spell` is the first element of `magic_words`, and `func_2(spell) != power`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- `spell` should be the second element of `magic_words`.
- The condition `func_2(spell) != power` must still hold true.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `j` is 1, `spell` is the second element of `magic_words`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**
