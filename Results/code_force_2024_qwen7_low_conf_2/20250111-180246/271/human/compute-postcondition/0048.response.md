Functionality: **The function `func_3` takes a list of strings `magic_words` and an integer `power` as inputs. It iterates through all possible pairs of strings in `magic_words`, concatenating them to form a spell. For each spell, it checks if the result of calling `func_2(spell)` equals `power`. If such a pair is found, the function returns the indices `i + 1` and `j + 1` corresponding to the positions of the strings in `magic_words`. If no valid pair is found, the function returns `(-1, -1)`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `magic_words` is empty. In such a case, the function should return `(-1, -1)` immediately without entering the nested loop.
- The function assumes that `func_2` is defined and works correctly for the input `spell`. If `func_2` does not exist or behaves unexpectedly, the function might produce incorrect results or raise an exception.
- The function does not validate the type of `magic_words` and `power`. If `magic_words` is not a list of strings or `power` is not an integer, the function might behave unpredictably or raise errors. Proper input validation should be included to ensure the function behaves as expected.
