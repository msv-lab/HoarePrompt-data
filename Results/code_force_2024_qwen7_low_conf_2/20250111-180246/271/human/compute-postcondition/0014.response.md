Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i` is the index of the first string in `magic_words` such that there exists a `j` where `func_2(magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]) == power`, `j` is the index within the list such that `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` equals the correct spell if found, and `spell` is the correct spell `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` if found, otherwise `spell` is unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each combination of elements in `magic_words` using indices `i` and `j`.
- For each combination, it forms a spell by concatenating `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]` and checks if `func_2(spell)` equals `power`.
- If a match is found, the function returns the indices `i + 1` and `j + 1` (since indices are 0-based).
- If no match is found after all iterations, the loop will complete without returning, and the variables will retain their last values, specifically `spell` will remain unchanged.

Given this, after all iterations of the loop have finished, either a match will have been found and the indices returned, or the loop will have completed without finding a match, leaving `i` and `j` at their final values and `spell` unchanged.
