Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
   - `i` is the index of the first string in `magic_words` such that there exists a `j` where `func_2(magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]) == power`.
   - `j` is the index within the list such that `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` equals the correct spell if found.
   - `spell` is the correct spell `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` if found, otherwise `spell` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(magic_words)`.
   - For each iteration, the value of `i` increases by 1.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was set to the index of the first string in `magic_words` such that there exists a `j` where `func_2(magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]) == power`.
   - `j` is the index within the list such that `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` equals the correct spell if found.
   - `spell` is the correct spell `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` if found, otherwise `spell` remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The loop will check if `i + 1` is less than the length of `magic_words`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `j` and `spell` will remain unchanged unless they are reassigned within the loop body (which is omitted in this case).

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `j` and `spell` will remain as they were in the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i` is the index of the first string in `magic_words` such that there exists a `j` where `func_2(magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]) == power` or `i + 1`, `j` is the index within the list such that `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` equals the correct spell if found, otherwise `j` is unchanged, and `spell` is the correct spell `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` if found, otherwise `spell` remains unchanged.**

To summarize:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is unchanged, and `spell` is unchanged.**
