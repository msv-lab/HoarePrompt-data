Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is incremented by 1, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, then `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
