Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` where `i + 1` is `k + 1` and `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`. Since there is no else part, no alternative action is taken when `func_2(spell) != power`.***
