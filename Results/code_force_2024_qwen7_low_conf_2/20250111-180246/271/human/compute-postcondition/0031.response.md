According to the given for loop, the loop can execute as long as `magic_words` is a non-empty list and `j` is within the valid range of indices for the list. The initial state already indicates that `magic_words` has at least one element, so no adjustment is needed for this part.

The loop iterates over each index from 0 to `len(magic_words) - 1`. Since the loop is defined to iterate over `range(len(magic_words))`, we need to ensure that `j` is indeed within this range for the loop to execute correctly.

Given the initial state:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i + 1` is `k + 1`.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.

Since `j` is already specified to be in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, it is guaranteed that the loop can execute as long as `magic_words` is a non-empty list, which is already stated.

Therefore, no further adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute based on the given information.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`**
