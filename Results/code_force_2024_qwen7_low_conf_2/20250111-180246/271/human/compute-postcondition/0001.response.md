State before the loop starts: `magic_words` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `power` is an integer representing the power of a spell, `i` is 0.

Step-by-step thinking:

1. The loop will start with `j` set to 0 since the range function will generate numbers from 0 up to but not including the length of `magic_words`.
2. For the loop to execute, the list `magic_words` must have at least one element because the range function will generate a sequence starting from 0.
3. The variable `i` is mentioned, but it is not directly used in the loop header. It might be a typo or a red herring, as `j` is the loop variable.
4. The variable `power` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `magic_words` must have at least one element and `j` should start from 0.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `j` is 0**
