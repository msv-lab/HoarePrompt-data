`i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is in the range [0, len(magic_words) - 1]. `spell` is updated to be the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is in the range [0, len(magic_words) - 1], `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`.
Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is in the range [0, len(magic_words) - 1], `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`**
