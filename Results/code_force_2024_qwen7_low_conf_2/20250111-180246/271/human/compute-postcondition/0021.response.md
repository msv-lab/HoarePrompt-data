Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power`.

### For Loop Statement
```python
for j in range(len(magic_words)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The problem statement mentions that `i` is `i + 1`. This implies that `i` has already been incremented.
2. **Variable `j`**: The variable `j` ranges from `0` to `len(magic_words) - 1`. Since `j` is within this range, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is within the bounds.
3. **Variable `spell`**: `spell` is defined as `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`. The value of `spell` depends on the current values of `i` and `j`.
4. **Condition `func_2(spell) != power`**: This condition needs to be satisfied for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is `i + 1`, we need to update the value of `i` to `i + 1`.
2. **Update `j`**: `j` must remain within the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]` for the loop to execute again. However, since no specific condition was given for `j` other than it being within the range, we assume it can be any valid value within this range.
3. **Recompute `spell`**: Given the new value of `i` (which is now `i + 1`), `spell` will be recomputed as `magic_words[i + 1] + magic_words[j]`.
4. **Check Condition**: Ensure that `func_2(spell) != power` still holds true for the updated `spell`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- `spell` is `magic_words[i + 1] + magic_words[j]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power`.

### Final Answer
State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i` is `i + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, `spell` is `magic_words[i + 1] + magic_words[j]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**.
