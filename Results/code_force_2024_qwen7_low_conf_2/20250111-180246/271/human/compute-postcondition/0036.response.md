According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `magic_words` using the variable `j`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` is within the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `i + 1` is `k + 1`.
- `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- `spell` is `magic_words[k] + magic_words[j]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and still remain within the valid range. Since `j` was previously in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`, but it must still be within the same range.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that:
- `magic_words` remains the same (a list of strings with at least one element).
- `i + 1` remains `k + 1`.
- `j` becomes `j + 1`, and it must still be within the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`.
- `spell` becomes `magic_words[k] + magic_words[j + 1]`.
- `func_2(spell) != power` must still hold true.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, `spell` is `magic_words[k] + magic_words[j + 1]`, and `func_2(spell) != power`**
