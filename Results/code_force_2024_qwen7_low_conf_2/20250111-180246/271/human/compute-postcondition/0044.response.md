Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, and `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`. If there exists a pair of indices (i, j) such that `func_2(magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]) == power`, the program returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, the program returns `None`.**
