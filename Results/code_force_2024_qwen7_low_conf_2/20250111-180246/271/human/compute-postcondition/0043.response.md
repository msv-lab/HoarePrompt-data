Postcondition: ***`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 2]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the function returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` where `i + 1` is `k + 1` and `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 2]`. If `func_2(spell) != power`, no return value is specified and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
