According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range of `len(magic_words)`. At the end of the last iteration, `magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `(i + 1, j + 1)`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the valid range, which means `j < len(magic_words) - 1`.

State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 2]`, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]`, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, the program returns `(i + 1, j + 1)` where `i + 1` is `k + 1` and `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 2]`.
