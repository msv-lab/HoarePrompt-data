Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, `j` is in the range [0, len(magic_words) - 1] for each iteration, `spell` is `magic_words[i] + magic_words[j]` for each iteration, and if `func_2(spell) == power`, then the function returns the tuple (`i + 1`, `j + 1`). Otherwise, the function does not return anything (None).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range of the length of `magic_words` using `j`.
- For each iteration, `spell` is updated to be the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`.
- The function `func_2(spell)` is called with the current `spell`, and if its result equals `power`, the function returns the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- If `func_2(spell)` does not equal `power`, the loop continues, and the values of `i` and `j` are incremented accordingly.
- The loop continues until either a match is found or all possible combinations of `i` and `j` are exhausted.
- If no match is found, the function returns `None`.
