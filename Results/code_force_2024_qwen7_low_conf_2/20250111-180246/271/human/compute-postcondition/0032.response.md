`spell` is assigned the concatenation of `magic_words[i]` and `magic_words[j]`. The value of `i + 1` is `k + 1`, which means `i = k`. The value of `j` is within the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`. After executing the code, the value of `spell` is the concatenation of `magic_words[k]` and `magic_words[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`magic_words` is a list of strings with at least one element, `i + 1` is `k + 1`, `j` is in the range `[0, len(magic_words) - 1]`, `spell` is `magic_words[k] + magic_words[j]`**
