Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate the required number of distinct magic words. The `func_1` function generates the magic words, but it does not ensure that all generated words are distinct. This can lead to duplicate magic words, which violates the problem's requirement that the magic words must be distinct. For example, if the function generates more than one word of the same length with the same characters, it will result in duplicate magic words. This issue makes the program incorrect according to the problem description.
