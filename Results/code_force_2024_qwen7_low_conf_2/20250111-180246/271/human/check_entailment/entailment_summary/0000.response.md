Reasoning:
- **Function `func_1`**: Generates `n` distinct magic words, each of which has a length between 1 and \(30 \times n\), consisting only of 'X' and 'O'. This meets the requirements of the problem.
- **Function `func_2`**: Computes the number of unique substrings of a given string `s`. This function is used to calculate the power of a spell and works correctly as per the problem statement.
- **Function `func_3`**: Given a list of magic words and a spell power, it finds the two magic words that concatenate to produce a spell with the specified power. It iterates through all pairs of words, forms the spell, and checks the power using `func_2`. If the power matches, it returns the indices (adjusted by adding 1) of the words. If no match is found, it returns `(-1, -1)`. This function logic aligns with the problem's requirements.

Given the interactions and the behavior of these functions, the overall program should be able to correctly generate the magic words and determine the correct indices of the words that were concatenated by each student to form a spell with a given power. Since all parts of the solution appear to meet the requirements and constraints specified in the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
