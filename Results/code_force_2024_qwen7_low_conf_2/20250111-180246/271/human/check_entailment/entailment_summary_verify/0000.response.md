### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires generating \( n \) distinct magic words consisting of characters 'X' and 'O'.
   - These magic words must be unique and each must have at least 1 and at most \( 30 \cdot n \) characters.
   - The solution must correctly handle queries by determining which two magic words were concatenated to produce a given spell power.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Generates \( n \) distinct magic words.
     - The function uses `random.randint` to decide the length of each word between 1 and \( 30 \cdot n \).
     - The words are constructed using random choices of 'X' and 'O'.
     - The function ensures uniqueness by adding each newly generated word to the list `magic_words`.
     - This approach guarantees that the generated words are distinct, as each word is added to the list only if it hasn't been seen before.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - Computes the number of distinct non-empty substrings of a given string `s`.
   - Uses a nested loop to generate all possible substrings and adds them to a set to avoid duplicates.
   - Returns the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct substrings.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   - Iterates over all pairs of magic words.
   - Concatenates each pair to form a spell.
   - Checks if the power of the spell (using `func_2`) matches the given power.
   - Returns the indices of the magic words if a match is found, otherwise returns `(-1, -1)`.

5. **Function Summaries:**
   - Function 1 generates distinct magic words.
   - Function 2 computes the number of distinct substrings.
   - Function 3 finds the pair of magic words that form a spell with the given power.

6. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly generate distinct magic words, leading to potential duplicates.
   - However, the analysis of `func_1` shows that it correctly ensures the distinctness of the generated words.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly generates distinct magic words and handles the queries accurately using the provided functions. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
