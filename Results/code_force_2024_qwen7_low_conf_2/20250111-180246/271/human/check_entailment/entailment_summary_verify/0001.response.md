### Reasoning:

1. **Magic Words Generation**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly generates `n` distinct magic words, each with a random length between 1 and 30 * n characters. Each character is randomly chosen to be either 'X' or 'O'. This part is implemented correctly and meets the problem requirements.

2. **Substrings Calculation**:
   - The `func_2` function calculates the number of unique non-empty substrings of a given string `s`. It iterates through all possible substrings and adds them to a set, ensuring uniqueness. This function is also correctly implemented and accurately computes the number of unique non-empty substrings.

3. **Spell Power Matching**:
   - The `func_3` function is designed to find the indices of the two magic words that, when concatenated, produce a spell with a given power. The function iterates through all possible pairs of magic words, concatenates them, and checks if the result of `func_2` matches the target power. If a match is found, it returns the indices; otherwise, it returns `(-1, -1)`.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation. The function does not account for the possibility that the same magic word might be used twice. While the problem statement guarantees that the spell power can always be matched, the function may return incorrect indices if the same word is used twice and the substring count happens to match due to coincidental overlaps. This could lead to returning indices that do not correspond to the actual words used by the student.

4. **Interaction**:
   - The main logic correctly reads the input `n`, prints `n` magic words, reads the number of students `q`, and processes each student's request to find the indices of the magic words that match the given spell power. The interaction follows the specified protocol, including flushing the output streams after each step.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Magic Word Generation**: The generation of magic words is random but meets the constraints and requirements.
- **Substring Counting**: The substring counting logic is accurate and handles all possible substrings without duplicates.
- **Spell Power Matching**: The logic for matching the spell power to the correct pair of magic words is thorough, but it fails to account for the possibility of using the same word twice. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **partially accurate**. While the overall structure of the program adheres to the problem statement and constraints, the `func_3` function does not correctly handle the case where the same magic word is used twice, which can lead to incorrect indices being returned.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
