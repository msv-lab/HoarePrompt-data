`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer, and this integer value is assigned to `r`. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 is not affected by the code. Therefore, the output state is: `k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
