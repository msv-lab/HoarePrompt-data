`additional_areas` appends the value of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. The value of `r` is `int(data[index])`, and the value of `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`. Since `additional_areas` previously contained `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, it now contains this value plus the new appended value. The index is increased by 2, so the value of `index` is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `r` is int(data[index]), `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m) twice, `index` is index + 2**
