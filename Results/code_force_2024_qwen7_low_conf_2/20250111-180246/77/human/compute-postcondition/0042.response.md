Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
   - `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - The loop variable `_` is used, which means the loop is only iterating based on the value of `k`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `k`, the loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is still greater than 0 (because if it was not, the loop would have stopped).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `k` is greater than 0, we need to decrement `k` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `r`, `c`, and `additional_areas` remain the same because they are not modified within the loop body (since the loop body is omitted).

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `k` will be `k - 1`.
   - `r` remains the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
   - `c` remains the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.
   - `additional_areas` remains the same as it contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`k` is greater than 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**.
