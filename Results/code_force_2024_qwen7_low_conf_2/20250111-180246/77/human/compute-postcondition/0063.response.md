The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 10]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`
- `additional_areas` is an empty list
- `index` is the original index + 10
- `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)

After executing the code `c = int(data[index + 1])`, the new value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 10]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is the original index + 10, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
