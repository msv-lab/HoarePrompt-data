The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Initially, `index` was `original index + 4`. After the increment, `index` becomes `(original index + 4) + 3`, which simplifies to `original index + 7`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is `original index + 7`, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**
