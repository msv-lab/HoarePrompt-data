The code updates the value of `c` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The previous value of `c` was `data[index + 3]`, so now `c` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`. The other variables (`r`, `index`, and `additional_areas`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
