The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the `additional_areas` list. Here, `r` and `c` are the integer values of `data[index + 10]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively, and `n` and `m` are also defined similarly. However, the specific values of `r`, `c`, `n`, and `m` are not provided. 

Let's denote the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` as `result_of_func_1`. Therefore, `additional_areas` is updated to include this new element.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 10]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now `[result_of_func_1]`, `index` is `original index + 12`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
