`alpha` is assigned the value of `(n * m + 1) // 2`. The value of `n` and `m` are taken from `data[index + 1]` and `data[index + 2]` respectively, which means `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` and `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is `original index + 7`, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `alpha` is equal to `(n * m + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is `original index + 7`, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `alpha` is equal to `(n * m + 1) // 2`.**
