Output State: **`t` is the initial value of `t`, `results` is a list of tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)` where for each tuple: `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\) with `n` being the integer value of `data[index - 6]` and `m` being the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, and `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each pair `(r, c)` with `r` being the integer value of `data[index - 4 - 2 * j]` and `c` being the integer value of `data[index - 3 - 2 * j]` for `j` in the range of the length of `additional_areas`. `index` is the final value after all iterations of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the integer value of `data[index]` in the first iteration. Each time the loop runs, it increments `index` by 3.
- Inside the loop, it processes `k` pairs `(r, c)` for each iteration, where `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` in the first inner loop iteration. It updates `index` by 2 for each pair processed.
- The outer loop continues until `t` decrements to 0, meaning the loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration of the loop, `alpha` is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\) with `n` and `m` being the integers from `data[index - 5]` and `data[index - 6]` respectively.
- `additional_areas` is a list of results from calling `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each pair `(r, c)`, where `r` and `c` are the integers from `data[index - 4 - 2 * j]` and `data[index - 3 - 2 * j]` respectively.
- After all iterations, `results` is a list containing all these tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

Since the loop stops when `t` reaches 0, `t` retains its original value, and `index` reflects the final position after the last loop iteration.
