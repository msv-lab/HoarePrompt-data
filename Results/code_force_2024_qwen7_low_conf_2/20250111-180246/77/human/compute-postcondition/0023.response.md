Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `r` is `int(data[index - 4])`
   - `c` is `int(data[index - 3])`
   - `index` is increased by 4
   - `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for __ in range(k):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - Each iteration of the loop does not change the values of `r`, `c`, or `index`.
   - The loop modifies `additional_areas` in some way, but the exact details of the loop body are not provided.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `r`, `c`, and `index` do not change within the loop, their values remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The key factor here is the number of iterations left. Initially, there were `k` iterations to run, and since one iteration has just completed, there are now `k-1` iterations remaining.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `r` is still `int(data[index - 4])`
   - `c` is still `int(data[index - 3])`
   - `index` has been increased by 4 (but this value is not directly relevant to the loop itself)
   - `additional_areas` remains unchanged from the previous iteration (as the loop body is not specified, we assume no changes to `additional_areas`)

Given these points, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`r` is `int(data[index - 4])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 3])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result, and `k` is decreased by 1**
