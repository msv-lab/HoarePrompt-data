The code `r = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `r`. Given the initial state, the only specific change here is the value of `r`.

- `t` is `t - 1`
- `k` is 1
- `r` is now the integer value of `data[index]` (from the initial state, `r` was the integer value of `data[index + 10]`)
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1]`
- `index` is `original index + 12`
- `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)

Since the value of `r` is updated, the output state includes this change.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1]`, `index` is `original index + 12`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
