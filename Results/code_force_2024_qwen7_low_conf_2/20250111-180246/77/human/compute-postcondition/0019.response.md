`r` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The previous value of `r` was the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` was increased by 2. Therefore, the new value of `r` is `int(data[index])`. The value of `c` remains unchanged, and `additional_areas` also remains unchanged as the code does not modify these variables.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 2, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
