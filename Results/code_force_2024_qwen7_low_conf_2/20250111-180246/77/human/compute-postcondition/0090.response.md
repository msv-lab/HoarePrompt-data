The code prints the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces. This does not affect the values of `results` or change the console output from the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; the console output is the value of `alpha`; the console output is also the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces.**
