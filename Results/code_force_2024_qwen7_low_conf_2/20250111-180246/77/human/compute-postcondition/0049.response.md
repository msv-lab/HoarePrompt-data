The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The previous value of `c` was `int(data[index + 1])`, and now it is reassigned based on the new value of `data[index + 1]`.

- The value of `k` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `r` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `additional_areas` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- The value of `index` is updated to `index + 2` due to the previous statement `index` is index + 2, and this value is not changed by the current code.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is data[index], `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m) twice, `index` is index + 2**
