The code `index = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `index`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `data` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input; `index` is `0`**
