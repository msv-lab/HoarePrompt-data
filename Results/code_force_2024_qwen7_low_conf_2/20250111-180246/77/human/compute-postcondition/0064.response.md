The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `index` was `original index + 10`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is now `original index + 12`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 10]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is `original index + 12`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
