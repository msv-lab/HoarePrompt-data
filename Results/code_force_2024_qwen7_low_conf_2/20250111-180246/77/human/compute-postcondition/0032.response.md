The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `m` after converting it to an integer. Based on the initial state, `index` is increased by 4, and the value of `m` is derived from `data[index + 1]`.

Here's the breakdown:
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`
- `index` is increased by 4
- `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration
- `k` is 1
- `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`

After executing `m = int(data[index + 1])`:
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index - 6]`
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index - 5]`
- `index` is now the original value of `index` plus 4
- `additional_areas` remains unchanged
- `k` remains 1
- `m` is now the integer value of `data[index + 1]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is the original index plus 4, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is 1, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**
