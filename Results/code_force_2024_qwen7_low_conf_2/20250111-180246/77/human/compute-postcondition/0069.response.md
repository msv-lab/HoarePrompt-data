The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The original value of `index` is `original index + 12`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `(original index + 12) + 2 = original index + 14`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1]`, `index` is `original index + 14`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
