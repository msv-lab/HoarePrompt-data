Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*k`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `k` times, and each time it updates `r`, `c`, and appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to `additional_areas`.
- After `k` iterations, `r` will be the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]` and `c` will be the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`.
- `additional_areas` will contain `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times.
- `index` will be updated by `2*k`, so it will be `original index + 7 + 2*k`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `k` is 0), then:
- `k` is 0.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index - 6]`.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index - 5]`.
- `additional_areas` is an empty list.
- `index` remains `original index + 7`.
