Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is based on the variable `k`. The loop will continue as long as `k` is greater than 0.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 10]`
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
   - `additional_areas` is now `[result_of_func_1]`
   - `index` is `original index + 12`
   - `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`
   - `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
   - `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop runs for `k` iterations, at the end of each iteration, `k` is decremented by 1.
   - Given that `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, after the previous iteration, `k` must have been decremented from a positive value to 0 or a negative value (but since `k` must remain greater than 0, it means `k` was 1 before this iteration).
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be set to a value greater than 0 (typically 1).

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `k` should be set to 1 (assuming the loop needs to execute one more time).
- All other states remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 10]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is now `[result_of_func_1]`, `index` is `original index + 12`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
