The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The variables `r`, `c`, and `n, m` remain unchanged, but `index` is increased by 4, and `additional_areas` now contains the new result.

- `r` is `int(data[index - 4])`
- `c` is `int(data[index - 3])`
- `index` is increased by 4
- `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index - 4])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 3])`, `index` is increased by 4, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result**
