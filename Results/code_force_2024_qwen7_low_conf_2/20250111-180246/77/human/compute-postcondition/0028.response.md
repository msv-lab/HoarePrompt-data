Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k) + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2*k, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, `k` is reduced to 0, and `k` being 0 ensures no further iterations of the loop will occur.**
