`alpha` is assigned the value \((n * m + 1) // 2\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Specifically, `t` is \(t - 1\), `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is the original index + 10, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, and `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is the original index + 10, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
