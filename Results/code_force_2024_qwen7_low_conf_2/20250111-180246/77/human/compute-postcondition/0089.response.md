The code `print(alpha)` prints the value of `alpha`. This does not change the value of `alpha` or any other variables. The output of the print statement is simply the value of `alpha`, which is then printed to the console. The `results` list and the `additional_areas` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; the console output is the value of `alpha`; the console output is also the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces.**
