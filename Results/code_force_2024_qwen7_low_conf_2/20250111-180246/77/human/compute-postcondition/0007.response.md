The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. Given that `index` is initially 1, `n` will be assigned the integer value of `data[1]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list [], `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`**
