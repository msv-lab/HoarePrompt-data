The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `t` is `t - 1`
- `k` is 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1, func_1((r, c), n, m)]`
- `index` is `original index + 14`
- `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)

After executing `index += 2`, the value of `index` will be updated to its current value plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1, func_1((r, c), n, m)]`, `index` is `original index + 16`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
