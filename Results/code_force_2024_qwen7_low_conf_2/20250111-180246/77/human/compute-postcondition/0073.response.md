The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. From the initial state, we know that `c` was previously the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Now, this assignment simply reassigns the same value to `c`, so there's no change in the value of `c`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1, func_1((r, c), n, m)]`, `index` is `original index + 14`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
