Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `t`: This variable is mentioned but its value (`initial value of t`) is not critical for determining whether the loop can execute, as the loop itself does not directly depend on `t`.
- `results`: This is a list of tuples `(alpha, additional_areas)`. Each tuple contains:
  - `alpha`: It is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\), where `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]` and `m` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`.
  - `additional_areas`: This is a list of results from applying `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each pair `(r, c)`, where `r` and `c` are the integer values of `data[index - 4 - 2 * j]` and `data[index - 3 - 2 * j]` respectively, for `j` in the range of the length of `additional_areas`.

### For Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each tuple in `results`:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute:
1. **`results` must not be an empty list**: The loop will only execute if `results` has at least one tuple.
2. **Each tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` must exist within `results`**: Since the loop iterates over `results`, there must be at least one tuple present.

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `results` is not an empty list.
- Ensure each tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` exists within `results`.

Given these conditions, the adjusted states would be:

**State:**
- `results` is a non-empty list.
- Each tuple in `results` is of the form `(alpha, additional_areas)` where:
  - `alpha` is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\) with `n` being the integer value of `data[index - 6]` and `m` being the integer value of `data[index - 5]`.
  - `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each pair `(r, c)`, where `r` and `c` are the integer values of `data[index - 4 - 2 * j]` and `data[index - 3 - 2 * j]` respectively, for `j` in the range of the length of `additional_areas`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`results` is a non-empty list, and each tuple in `results` is of the form `(alpha, additional_areas)` where `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\) with `n` being the integer value of `data[index - 6]` and `m` being the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, and `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each pair `(r, c)`, where `r` and `c` are the integer values of `data[index - 4 - 2 * j]` and `data[index - 3 - 2 * j]` respectively, for `j` in the range of the length of `additional_areas`.**
