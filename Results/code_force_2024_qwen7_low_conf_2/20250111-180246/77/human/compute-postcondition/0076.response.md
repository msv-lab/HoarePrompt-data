Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1` to each pair `(r, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `index` is `original index + 2 * k * 2`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1` at the start of the loop.
- **`k`**: After the loop completes, `k` will be 0 because the loop runs `k` times, and upon completion, `k` is no longer incremented.
- **`r` and `c`**: These values are updated within the loop, and after the loop, they will be the last values assigned, which are `r = int(data[index])` and `c = int(data[index + 1])`.
- **`additional_areas`**: This list accumulates the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration of the loop. After `k` iterations, this list will contain `k` elements.
- **`index`**: The value of `index` increases by 2 in each iteration of the loop. After `k` iterations, `index` will be `original index + 2 * k * 2`.
- **`results`**: The list `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, where `alpha` is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
- **`m`**: This value remains unchanged throughout the loop and is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `k` is 0 initially), the values of `r` and `c` will still be the values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`, respectively. The `additional_areas` list will be empty since no iterations occur.
