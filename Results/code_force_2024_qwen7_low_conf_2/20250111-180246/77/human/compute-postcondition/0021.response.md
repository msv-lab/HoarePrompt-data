The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. This changes the value of `index` but does not affect the values of `r`, `c`, or `additional_areas`. The initial state also includes that `index` is increased by 2, which means this increment happens twice, making the total increment 4.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `r` remains `int(data[index - 4])`
- `c` remains `int(data[index - 3])`
- `index` is now `index + 2`
- `additional_areas` remains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index - 4])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 3])`, `index` is increased by 4, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
