The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. Let's break down the changes:

1. Initially, `additional_areas` is a list containing two elements: `result_of_func_1` and `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.
2. After executing the code, the list `additional_areas` is updated to include one more element, which is the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

Therefore, the new state of `additional_areas` will be a list containing three elements: `result_of_func_1`, `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, and another instance of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

All other variables remain unchanged in their respective values from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1, func_1((r, c), n, m), func_1((r, c), n, m)]`, `index` is `original index + 16`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
