`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` was previously increased by 2, so now `index` is further increased by 2, making it increase by 4 in total. The values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, `k`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is increased by 4, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is 1, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is increased by 4, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is 1, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**.
