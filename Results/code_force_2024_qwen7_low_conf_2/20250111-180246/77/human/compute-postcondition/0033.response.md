`k` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 2])`. The value of `data[index + 2]` is converted to an integer, which updates the value of `k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is the original index plus 4, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**
