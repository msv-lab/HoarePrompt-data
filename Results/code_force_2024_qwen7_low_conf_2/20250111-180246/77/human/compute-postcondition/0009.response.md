The code assigns the value of `data[index + 2]` to `k`. Given that `data` is a list of strings and `index` is 2, `data[index + 2]` corresponds to `data[4]`. Since `data[4]` is a string, it will be converted to an integer using `int()`. The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list [], `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`.**
