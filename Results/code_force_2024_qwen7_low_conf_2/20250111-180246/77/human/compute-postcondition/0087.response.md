According to the code, the loop iterates over each tuple in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `results` is a non-empty list.
- Each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`).
- The value of `alpha` (the first element of the tuple) is printed.
- The console output is the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state as follows:
1. The current tuple being processed by the loop will be the next tuple in the `results` list.
2. The `alpha` value from the new tuple will be printed.
3. The console output will be the elements of the `additional_areas` from the new tuple joined with spaces.

Let's denote the current tuple being processed as `(alpha_current, additional_areas_current)`. After processing this tuple, the next tuple will be `(alpha_next, additional_areas_next)`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration are:
- `results` remains a non-empty list.
- The `alpha` value (first element of the next tuple) is `alpha_next`.
- The console output will be the elements of `additional_areas_next` joined with spaces.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); the next `alpha` (the value of the first element of the next tuple) is printed; the console output is the elements of `additional_areas_next` joined with spaces**.
