The code appends a tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` to the `results` list. Let's break down the steps:

1. `alpha` is defined as \((n * m + 1) // 2\).
2. `results` is updated by appending the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

Since the code does not change the values of `t`, `k`, `r`, `c`, `data`, `index`, `m`, or `additional_areas`, these variables remain unchanged. The only change is in the `results` list, which now contains an additional element.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1` to each pair `(r, c)` for each iteration of the loop, `index` is `original index + 2 * k * 2`, `results` is a list containing an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
