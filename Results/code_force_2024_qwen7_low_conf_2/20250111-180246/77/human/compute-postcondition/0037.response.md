Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Variable:**
   The loop variable is `__` (which we can refer to as `i`), and the loop runs `k` times.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `range(k)`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1.

3. **Given States:**
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`.
   - `index` is `original index + 7`.
   - `additional_areas` is an empty list.
   - `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
   - `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `alpha` is equal to `(n * m + 1) // 2`.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `k` is the loop control variable, it must be checked to ensure it is at least 1.
   - The values of `r`, `c`, `index`, `additional_areas`, `m`, and `alpha` do not affect the loop execution directly.

### Conclusion

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is at least 1.

### Final State Adjustment

State: **`k` must be greater than 0**

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
