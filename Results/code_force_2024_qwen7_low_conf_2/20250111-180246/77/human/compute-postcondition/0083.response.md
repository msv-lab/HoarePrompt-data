According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, and each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`), where `alpha` is printed, and `' '.join(map(str, additional_areas))` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list. After the current iteration, the list will lose its first element (the current `result` being processed). Therefore, `results` should still be a non-empty list.

Let's adjust the states:

- `results` is a non-empty list.
- Each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`).
- `alpha` is printed.
- `' '.join(map(str, additional_areas))` is printed.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); `alpha` is printed; ' '.join(map(str, additional_areas))` is printed**
