The code snippet appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. `additional_areas` was initially `[result_of_func_1]`.
2. After executing the line `additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))`, the new value of `additional_areas` will be `[result_of_func_1, func_1((r, c), n, m)]`.

No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1, func_1((r, c), n, m)]`, `index` is `original index + 14`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
