The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The values of `k`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged, but now `additional_areas` contains the result of the function call. Since the actual values of `n` and `m` are not specified, they remain as part of the function call in the output.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`; `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
