Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Control Variables**:
   - The loop is controlled by `__` which runs `k` times.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is a positive integer and greater than 0.

2. **Initial States Provided**:
   - `t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
   - `index` is 5.
   - `results` is an empty list `[]`.
   - `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
   - `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`.
   - `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`.
   - `additional_areas` is an empty list `[]`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop runs based on the value of `k`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.

### Required Adjustments:
- Since `k` is derived from `data[4]` and is required to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure this condition is met.

### Final State After Adjustment:
- We need to adjust the state such that `k` is greater than 0. 

### State After Adjustment:
- `t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
- `index` is 5.
- `results` is an empty list `[]`.
- `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[4]` and must be greater than 0.
- `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`.
- `additional_areas` is an empty list `[]`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list [], `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]` and must be greater than 0, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`, `additional_areas` is an empty list []**
