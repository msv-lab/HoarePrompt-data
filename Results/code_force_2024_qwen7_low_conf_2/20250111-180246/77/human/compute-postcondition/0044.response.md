The code updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The previous values of `k`, `r`, and `additional_areas` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `r` is int(data[index]), `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m)**
