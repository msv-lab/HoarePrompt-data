The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. The initial value of `index` is `index + 2`, so after executing the code, `index` will be `(index + 2) + 2`, which simplifies to `index + 4`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is data[index], `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m) twice, `index` is index + 4**
