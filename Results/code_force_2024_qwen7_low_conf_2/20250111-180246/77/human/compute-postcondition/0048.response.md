The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r`. The previous value of `r` was `int(data[index])`, which means the new value of `r` is `data[index]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is data[index], `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m) twice, `index` is index + 2**
