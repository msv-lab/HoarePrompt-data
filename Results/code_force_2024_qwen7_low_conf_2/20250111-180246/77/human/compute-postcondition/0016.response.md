`index` is incremented by 2, which means the value of `index` changes, but the specific value of `index` is not provided in the initial state. The values of `r` and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is increased by 2.**
