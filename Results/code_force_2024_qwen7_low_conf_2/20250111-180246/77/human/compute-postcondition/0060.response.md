The code initializes `additional_areas` as an empty list. This means that the previous content of `additional_areas` is removed, and it is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `index` is the original index + 10, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
