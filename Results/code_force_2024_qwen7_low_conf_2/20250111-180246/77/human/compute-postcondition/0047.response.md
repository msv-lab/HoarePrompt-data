According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 1. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1, `r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` twice, and `index` is `index + 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1, and it must still be greater than 1. Therefore, we need to decrement `k` by 1 and ensure that `k` remains greater than 1.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `k` is now `k - 1` (decremented by 1).
- `r` and `c` remain the same.
- `additional_areas` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify this variable.
- `index` remains the same because the problem statement does not indicate any change in `index` within the loop body.

Step-by-step adjustment:
1. Decrement `k` by 1.
2. Ensure `k` is still greater than 1.
3. Keep `r` and `c` unchanged.
4. Keep `additional_areas` unchanged.
5. Keep `index` unchanged.

State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is int(data[index]), `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m) twice, `index` is index + 2**
