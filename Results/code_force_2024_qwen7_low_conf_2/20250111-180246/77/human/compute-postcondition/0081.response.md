The code snippet prints the value of `alpha`. The value of `alpha` is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\) with `n` being the integer value of `data[index - 6]` and `m` being the integer value of `data[index - 5]`. Since the code simply prints `alpha`, the value of `alpha` is displayed, but no changes are made to any of the variables. 

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`) where `alpha` is calculated as \((n * m + 1) // 2\) with `n` being the integer value of `data[index - 6]` and `m` being the integer value of `data[index - 5]`; `additional_areas` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each pair `(r, c)`, where `r` and `c` are the integer values of `data[index - 4 - 2 * j]` and `data[index - 3 - 2 * j]` respectively, for `j` in the range of the length of `additional_areas`; `alpha` is printed.**
