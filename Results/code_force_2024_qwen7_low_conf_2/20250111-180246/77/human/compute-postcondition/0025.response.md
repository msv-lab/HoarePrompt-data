`c` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result, `k` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result, `k` is decreased by 1**
