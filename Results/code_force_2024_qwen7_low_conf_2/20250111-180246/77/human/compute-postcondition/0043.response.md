`r` is reassigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `k` remains greater than 1, and the value of `c` remains the integer value of `data[index + 3]`. The value of `additional_areas` remains unchanged as it was calculated before and does not depend on the current value of `r`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `r` is int(data[index]), `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**
