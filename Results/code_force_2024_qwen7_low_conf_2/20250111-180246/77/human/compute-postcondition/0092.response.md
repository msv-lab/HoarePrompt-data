The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the following parameters are accepted:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- A list of coordinates `fountains` where each coordinate is a pair of positive integers \((r_i, c_i)\) such that \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq m\), and all fountain coordinates are distinct and none of them is equal to \((n, 1)\).

The function does not directly return anything based on the provided output cases, but rather processes the input parameters to perform some unspecified operation. However, based on the given information, the function's output can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, followed by `t` sets of parameters for each test case: `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of fountain coordinates.**
