`index` is incremented by 2, which means the `index` moves two positions forward in the `data` list. However, the specific values of `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, and `k` remain unchanged. The output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result, `k` is decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 2**
