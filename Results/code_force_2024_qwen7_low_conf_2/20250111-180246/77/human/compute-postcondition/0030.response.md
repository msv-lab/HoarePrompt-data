Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k)]`
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k) + 1]`
   - `index` is increased by `2*k`
   - `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration
   - `k` is 0
   - `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.
   - The loop does not directly depend on the values of `r`, `c`, or `index` to determine if it should continue.
   - Instead, the loop is controlled by the variable `k`, which starts at 0 and presumably increments by 1 with each iteration.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - Since `k` was 0 at the start, after one iteration, `k` would be 1.
   - Therefore, `index` would be increased by `2 * 1 = 2`.

4. **New State**:
   - `r` will now be the integer value of `data[index - (2*1)] = data[index - 2]`
   - `c` will now be the integer value of `data[index - (2*1) + 1] = data[index - 1]`
   - `index` will have increased by 2 from its previous value.
   - `additional_areas` will contain the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this new iteration.
   - `k` will be 1.
   - `results` will still contain the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for this iteration, `k` is 1, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`**.
