The code `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3. According to the initial state, `index` was calculated as `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`. After incrementing by 3, the new value of `index` will be the original value plus 10.

The output state after executing the code will be:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is the original index + 10, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
