The code appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. Given the initial state, `r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `index` is increased by 2.

After executing the line of code `additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))`, the value of `additional_areas` will include the previously existing result and the new result from `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

The states of `r`, `c`, `k`, and `index` are updated as per the given operations. The `additional_areas` list now includes the function call result appended to its previous contents.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`, `k` is decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 2**
