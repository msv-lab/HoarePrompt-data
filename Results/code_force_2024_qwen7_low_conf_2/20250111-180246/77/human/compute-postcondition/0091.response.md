Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); for each tuple in `results`, `alpha` is printed and the elements of `additional_areas` are printed, each on a new line.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple in `results`.
   - For each iteration, it unpacks the tuple into `alpha` and `additional_areas`.
   - It prints `alpha` and then prints each element of `additional_areas` joined by spaces.

2. **Final Iteration Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, all tuples in `results` have been processed.
   - Each `alpha` and corresponding `additional_areas` from every tuple in `results` will have been printed.
   - Since the loop processes each tuple in `results`, and the loop itself will execute `len(results)` times, the output will reflect all `alpha` values and all `additional_areas` lists.

3. **State of Variables After Loop Completion**:
   - `results` remains unchanged from its initial state because the loop only processes its contents.
   - Each `alpha` value from the tuples in `results` is printed exactly once.
   - Each `additional_areas` list from the tuples in `results` is printed exactly once, with elements separated by spaces.

4. **Case Where the Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If `results` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and no output will be generated.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state is as described above.
