`index` is incremented by 2, which changes its value but does not affect the values of `k`, `r`, or `c`. The conditions that `k` must be greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, and `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`**
