The code `results.append((alpha, additional_areas))` appends a tuple containing `alpha` and `additional_areas` to the list `results`. The values of `alpha` and `additional_areas` remain unchanged, but they are now added to the list `results`.

- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k)]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k) + 1]`
- `index` is increased by `2*k`
- `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration
- `k` is reduced to 0, ensuring no further iterations of the loop will occur

Since `alpha` and `additional_areas` are appended to `results`, the output state includes this new entry in the list `results`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k)]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - (2*k) + 1]`, `index` is increased by `2*k`, `additional_areas` contains the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` for each iteration, `k` is 0, and `results` contains the tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)`.**
