`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The previous value of `r` was `int(data[index - 4])`, and the values of `c`, `additional_areas`, and `k` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 3])`, `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` and the newly appended result, `k` is decreased by 1**
