The code `print(' '.join(map(str, additional_areas)))` will join the elements of the `additional_areas` list into a single string, with each element separated by a space, and then print this string. This operation does not change the value of `results` or any other variables except potentially modifying the console output. Since the initial state of `results` is a non-empty list where each tuple is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`), and `alpha` is printed, the output on the console will be the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces. However, the `results` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); `alpha` (the value of the first element of `result`) is printed; the console output is the elements of `additional_areas` joined with spaces.**
