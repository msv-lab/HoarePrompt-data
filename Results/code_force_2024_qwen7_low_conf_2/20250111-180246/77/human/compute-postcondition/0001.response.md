The code reads input from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `data` are updated based on this input. 

- `t` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state.
- `data` is now a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input**.
