The code initializes `additional_areas` as an empty list. This means that the value of `additional_areas` changes from whatever it was previously (the results of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`) to an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 6]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 5]`, `index` is `original index + 7`, `additional_areas` is an empty list, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `alpha` is equal to `(n * m + 1) // 2`.**
