Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - `index` is increased by 2, so `index` is now `index + 2`.
   - `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `for __ in range(k)`, which means the loop will run `k` times if `k` is a positive integer.

3. **Determine the Adjusted States:**
   - Since `index` is increased by 2 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `index` will be `index + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the loop counter (which is not explicitly shown but implied by the range `k`) allows it to run another iteration.
   - Given that the loop runs `k` times, if the loop has completed `i` iterations so far, then for the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `r` as the integer value of `data[index + 2]` (since `index` is now `index + 2`).
- `c` as the integer value of `data[index + 3]` (since `index + 1` is now `index + 3`).
- `index` is now `index + 2`.
- `additional_areas` remains the same since it is not updated within the loop body based on the given information.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `index` is increased by 2, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`**.
