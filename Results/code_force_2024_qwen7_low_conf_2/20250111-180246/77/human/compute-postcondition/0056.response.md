`m` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. According to the initial state, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`, and `data[index]` is an integer value `n`. Therefore, `data[index + 1]` is the next element in the list `data`. The value of `m` is the integer value of this next element.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `k` is the same
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`
- `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times
- `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`
- `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`
- `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the same, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
