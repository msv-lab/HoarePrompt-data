`index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 0, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 1. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer obtained by converting `data[index]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained by converting `data[index]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1**
