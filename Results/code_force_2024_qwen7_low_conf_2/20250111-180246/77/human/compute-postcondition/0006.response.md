Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is specified by `range(t)`, where `t` is the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.

2. **Current States**:
   - `t` is an integer obtained by converting `data[index]` to an integer.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `results` is an empty list `[]`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `t` is determined by converting `data[index]` to an integer, we need to ensure that `data[1]` (since `index` is 1) is a string that can be successfully converted to an integer. If `data[1]` is not a valid integer, the conversion will fail, and the loop will not execute.
   - Additionally, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `data[1]` must be a valid integer string.
- `t` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list []**
