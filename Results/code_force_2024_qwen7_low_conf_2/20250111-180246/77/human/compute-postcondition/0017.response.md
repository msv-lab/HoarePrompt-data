`additional_areas.append(func_1((r, c), n, m))` appends the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` to the list `additional_areas`. The variables `r` and `c` remain unchanged, and the value of `index` is increased by 2. Therefore, the output state is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, and the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)` is appended to `additional_areas`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, and `additional_areas` contains the result of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`.**
