`t` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. Since `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, the value of `t` is converted from a string to an integer. The value of `index` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer obtained by converting `data[index]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 0**
