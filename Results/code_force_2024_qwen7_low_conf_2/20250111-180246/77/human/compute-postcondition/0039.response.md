The code assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The initial state specifies that `k` must be greater than 0 and `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. Since the code does not affect `k` or `r`, their values remain unchanged. The value of `c` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
