`additional_areas` appends the value of `func_1((r, c), n, m)`. The initial state includes that `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` twice, `k` is greater than 0, `r` is `data[index]`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `index` is `index + 4`. After appending, `additional_areas` will contain `func_1((r, c), n, m)` three times.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is `data[index]`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` three times, `index` is `index + 4`**
