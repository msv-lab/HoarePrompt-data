The code `alpha, additional_areas = result` unpacks the tuple `result` into the variables `alpha` and `additional_areas`. After this, `print(alpha)` is executed, which prints the value of `alpha`.

Given the initial state:
- `results` is a non-empty list where each tuple is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`).

After the code `alpha, additional_areas = result`:
- `alpha` is the first element of the tuple `result`.
- `additional_areas` is the second element of the tuple `result`.

The `print(alpha)` statement will print the value of `alpha`.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); `alpha` is the first element of the tuple `result`; `additional_areas` is the second element of the tuple `result`; `alpha` (the value of the first element of `result`) is printed**.
