The code initializes an empty list `additional_areas`. No changes are made to any of the existing variables. The values of `t`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `m`, `n`, `k`, and `alpha` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list [], `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`, `additional_areas` is an empty list []**
