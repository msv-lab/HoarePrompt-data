Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads in the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of a grid, the number of fountains \(k\), and the coordinates of each fountain. It then calculates a value \(\alpha\) defined as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). For each fountain, it calls another function `func_1` to compute an additional area related to the fountain's position. The results are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value \(\alpha\) and a list of the computed additional areas. Finally, the function prints \(\alpha\) and the computed additional areas for each test case.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If the input values for \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) do not meet the specified constraints (\(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)), the function will still process them, but it may lead to performance issues due to large inputs.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for invalid or out-of-bound coordinates in the input. While the annotation mentions that none of the fountain coordinates are equal to \((n, 1)\), it does not check for other out-of-bound conditions such as \(r > n\) or \(c > m\). If such coordinates are present, the function may fail or produce incorrect results.
