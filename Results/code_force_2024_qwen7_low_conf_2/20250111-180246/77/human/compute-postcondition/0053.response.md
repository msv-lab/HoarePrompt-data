The code appends a tuple `(alpha, additional_areas)` to the list `results`. Here, `alpha` and `additional_areas` are already defined in the initial state. No changes are made to `k`, `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, or `index`. The only action is the addition of the tuple to the list `results`.

Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*k`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`.**
