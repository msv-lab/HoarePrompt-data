The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The variable `index` is updated in a previous step to `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`. Since the value of `data[index]` is taken and converted to an integer, the variable `n` is now an integer value from `data[index]`.

All other variables (`t`, `k`, `r`, `c`, `additional_areas`, `index`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the same, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`**
