`k` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, which is converted to an integer. This changes the value of `k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Let's break it down:

- `t` remains as `t - 1`.
- `k` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 2]`.
- `r` remains as the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`.
- `c` remains as the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`.
- `additional_areas` still contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times.
- `index` remains as `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`.
- `results` still contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`.
- `m` remains as the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
