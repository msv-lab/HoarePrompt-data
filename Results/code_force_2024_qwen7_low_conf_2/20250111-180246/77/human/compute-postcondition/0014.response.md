The code snippet `r = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `r`. The variables `data` and `index` are not specified in their initial values, but the operation modifies the value of `r`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `data` and `index`, they remain unaffected.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `data` and `index` are unspecified.**
