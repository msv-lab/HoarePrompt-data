The code snippet prints the elements of the `additional_areas` list as a space-separated string. This operation does not change the values of any variables but rather outputs them. The initial values of `results`, `data`, `index`, and `alpha` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list; each tuple in `results` is of the form (`alpha`, `additional_areas`); `alpha` is printed; ' '.join(map(str, additional_areas)) is printed**
