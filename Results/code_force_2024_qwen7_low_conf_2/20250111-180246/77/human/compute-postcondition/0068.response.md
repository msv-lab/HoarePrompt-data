The code snippet `c = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Given the initial state, `c` was previously the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and now it remains the same. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `additional_areas` is `[result_of_func_1]`, `index` is `original index + 12`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`, `m` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `alpha` is \((n * m + 1) // 2\)**
