To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze it step by step.

### Given Information:
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`.
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`.
- `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times.
- `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*k`.
- `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` iterations. Since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, the variable `t` should be decreased by 1 if the loop has already run once.

2. **Index Update**: Each iteration of the loop updates the `index` by adding `2` (since `2*k` increments by `2` each time). Therefore, for the next iteration, `index` will be `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`.

3. **Additional Areas**: The number of times `func_1((r, c), n, m)` is called remains the same for each iteration (i.e., `k` times). This means that `additional_areas` will still contain `k` elements.

4. **Results List**: Since we add `(alpha, additional_areas)` to the `results` list in each iteration, for the next iteration, `results` will contain an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

### Adjusted States:
- `t` should be `t - 1` because the loop will run one less time.
- `index` should be updated to `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`.
- `results` will contain one more element `(alpha, additional_areas)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `k` is the same, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `additional_areas` contains `func_1((r, c), n, m)` exactly `k` times, `index` is `original index + 7 + 2*(k+1)`, `results` contains an additional element `(alpha, additional_areas)`**.
