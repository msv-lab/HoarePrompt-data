The provided code snippet reads input from stdin but does not perform any operations on the variables. It simply assigns the result of `sys.stdin.read()` to the `input` variable, which is typically used for reading large inputs efficiently. However, this operation itself does not change the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the coordinates of the fountains).

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). The coordinates of the fountains (r_i, c_i) are pairs of positive integers such that \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq m\), and all fountain coordinates are distinct and none of them is equal to (n, 1); `input` contains the entire input read from stdin.**
