`index` is incremented by 2, which means the `index` moves forward by 2 positions in the list or array `data`. The values of `k`, `r`, `c`, and `additional_areas` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is greater than 1, `r` is int(data[index]), `c` is int(data[index + 1]), `additional_areas` contains func_1((r, c), n, m), `index` is increased by 2**
