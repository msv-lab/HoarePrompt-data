The code assigns the value of `(n * m + 1) // 2` to the variable `alpha`. Given that `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, and both are positive integers, `alpha` will be calculated as `(n * m + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained by converting `data[1]` to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list [], `m` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `alpha` is `(n * m + 1) // 2`**
