The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `fountain` containing the row and column coordinates of a fountain on a field, along with two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of the field. It calculates the value of `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`, where `r` and `c` are the row and column coordinates from the `fountain` tuple, and returns this value. This calculation effectively computes the maximum distance from the fountain to the "middle" diagonal of the field (which is defined as the line from (1, n) to (m, 1)), adjusted by half a step, ensuring the result is non-negative. Potential edge cases include when the fountain is on the exact middle diagonal, resulting in a distance of 0, and when the coordinates are such that the absolute difference `abs(r + c - (n + 1))` is zero or negative, which the `max` function handles appropriately.
