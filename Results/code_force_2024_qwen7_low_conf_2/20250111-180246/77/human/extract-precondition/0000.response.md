Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that \(2 \leq n, m \leq 10^9\), and k is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). The coordinates of the fountains (r_i, c_i) are pairs of positive integers such that \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq m\), and all fountain coordinates are distinct and none of them is equal to (n, 1).**
