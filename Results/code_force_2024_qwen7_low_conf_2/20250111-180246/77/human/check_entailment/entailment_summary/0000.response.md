Reasoning:
- The program consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` calculates the maximum distance from a fountain to the "middle" diagonal of the field, which is a crucial component in determining how much additional area Alice can get if she takes control of a fountain.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases, calculating the maximum possible size of Alice's plot (\(\alpha\)) and the additional area Alice can gain if she takes control of each fountain.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It first calculates \(\alpha\) using the formula \((n \times m + 1) // 2\), which represents the maximum area Alice can get without any fountains. Then, for each fountain, it uses `func_1` to determine the additional area Alice can gain by taking control of that fountain.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the functions appear to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
