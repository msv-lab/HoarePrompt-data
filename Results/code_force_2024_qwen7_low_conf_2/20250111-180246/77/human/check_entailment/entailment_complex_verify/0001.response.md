### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the maximum area Alice can own by dividing a grid into two parts, with Alice owning the part including the cell (n, 1) and Bob owning the part including the cell (1, m).
   - Fountains are placed at specific locations, and giving Alice a fountain increases her potential ownership area.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can gain by considering the distance from the fountain to the main diagonal of the grid.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the additional area Alice can gain by using the formula `max(abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2, 0)`.
   - This formula computes the maximum distance from the fountain to the main diagonal, adjusted by half a step to ensure non-negativity.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calculates the required outputs.
   - It correctly initializes the total field size and the number of fountains.
   - It computes the initial area Alice can own (`alpha`) without any fountains, which is `(n * m + 1) // 2`.
   - For each fountain, it calls `func_1` to get the additional area Alice can gain if she gets that fountain.
   - Finally, it prints the results in the required format.

4. **Detailed Validation:**
   - **Initialization and Input Reading:**
     - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes variables for each test case.
   - **Calculating Initial Area (`alpha`):**
     - The calculation of `alpha` as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\) is correct, ensuring that Alice starts with half the grid plus one cell.
   - **Processing Each Fountain:**
     - The function correctly calls `func_1` for each fountain and stores the additional areas in a list.
   - **Printing Results:**
     - The function prints the initial area `alpha` followed by the additional areas for each fountain.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing the code and its annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum area Alice can own and the additional areas for each fountain. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
