### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires Alice to divide a rectangular field into two parts by starting from either the left or top boundary and moving right or down. Alice must own the cell (n, 1) and Bob must own the cell (1, m).
   - The goal is to maximize the area Alice can own, and to determine the additional area Alice gains by obtaining each fountain.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the distance from a fountain (r, c) to the main diagonal of the field. This distance is used to determine the additional area Alice can gain by placing the fountain at (r, c).
   - The formula `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)` ensures that the additional area is only positive if the fountain is within the bounds of the field and helps in partitioning the field optimally.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calculates the required outputs.
   - It correctly initializes the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid and the number of fountains \(k\).
   - It computes the initial area Alice can own, \(\alpha\), as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\).
   - For each fountain, it calls `func_1` to get the additional area Alice can gain if she gets that fountain.
   - Finally, it prints the results in the required format.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic in both functions seems to align with the problem statement.
   - However, there are a few critical points to consider:
     - The formula for \(\alpha\) should ensure that Alice's area is maximized by starting from the optimal cell on the left or top boundary.
     - The calculation of additional areas using `func_1` is correct and should account for the optimal placement of each fountain.

Upon closer inspection, the implementation of \(\alpha\) might need a bit more consideration. The formula \((n \times m + 1) // 2\) does not always guarantee the maximum area Alice can own, especially when considering the optimal path and the effect of fountains. 

In the example provided, the initial area calculation for \(\alpha\) seems to work for the given examples, but it might not be universally correct for all test cases. The optimal path and the effect of fountains need to be considered more carefully.

### Conclusion:

- The logic for `func_1` is correct.
- The overall structure of `func_2` is sound, but the initial area calculation for \(\alpha\) might not always yield the correct maximum area for Alice.

Given these considerations, the program might not always produce the correct results due to potential edge cases not fully handled by the current implementation.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
