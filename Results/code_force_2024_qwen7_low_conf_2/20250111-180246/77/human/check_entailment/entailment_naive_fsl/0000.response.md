Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible size of Alice's plot. Specifically, the calculation of `alpha` (the maximum size of Alice's plot without any fountain given to her) is incorrect. According to the problem, Alice must start from either the left or top boundary and move right or down, and she must own the cell (n, 1). The current implementation incorrectly calculates `alpha` using the formula `(n * m + 1) // 2`, which does not account for the actual movement constraints.

A correct approach would involve considering the positions of the fountains and how they affect Alice's possible paths. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, if we consider a simple 2x2 grid with a single fountain at (1, 1), the correct `alpha` should be 1, but the current implementation might produce an incorrect result.
