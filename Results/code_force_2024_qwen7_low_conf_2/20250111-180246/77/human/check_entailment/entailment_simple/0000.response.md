Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Alpha:**
   - The formula for calculating \(\alpha\) should consider the total number of fountains and their positions. Specifically, \(\alpha\) should account for the fact that one of the fountains can be given to Alice. The current implementation simply calculates \(\alpha\) as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\) without considering the fountains' positions.
   - The correct calculation should be more nuanced, taking into account the optimal placement of fountains for both Alice and Bob.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Additional Areas:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the additional area Alice can get if she gets a specific fountain. However, the logic in `func_1` only considers the distance from the fountain to the boundary without properly accounting for the fountain's position and its impact on the division.
   - The function should compute the exact impact of giving each fountain to Alice, which involves more complex logic to re-evaluate the best possible division of the field.

3. **Missing Consideration of Fountain Placement:**
   - The problem requires detailed consideration of how the fountains affect the division of the field. Simply splitting the field in half and considering the distance to the boundaries is not sufficient.
   - The correct solution would involve more complex combinatorial and geometric analysis to determine the best way to include each fountain in Alice's plot.

To summarize, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements and thus is incorrect.
