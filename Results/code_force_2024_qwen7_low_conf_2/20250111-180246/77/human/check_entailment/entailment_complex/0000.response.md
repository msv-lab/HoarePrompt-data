Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the maximum possible size of Alice's plot under different scenarios, including scenarios where Bob can give one of his fountains to Alice.
2. The provided code correctly implements the logic for determining \(\alpha\) and the additional areas for each fountain.
3. Function `func_1` calculates the maximum distance from a fountain to the "middle" diagonal of the field, which helps in determining how much additional area Alice can gain by owning that fountain.
4. In `func_2`, the code reads the input for each test case, calculates \(\alpha\) for each test case, and computes the additional areas for each fountain using `func_1`.
5. The results are stored and printed correctly, providing the necessary output for each test case.

Given the logical correctness of both functions and their implementation, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
