### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`
The function `func_1` calculates the maximum distance Alice can move away from the fountain while still starting from the top or left boundary and ending at (n, 1). The formula used is:
\[ \text{diagonal\_distance} = \left| r + c - (n + 1) \right| \]
The function then returns the maximum of half of this diagonal distance and 0:
\[ \max(\left| r + c - (n + 1) \right| // 2, 0) \]

This function seems to be calculating the maximum number of cells Alice can take if the fountain is placed at (r, c). However, this does not directly translate to the size of Alice's plot because it doesn't account for the path constraints and the specific placement of fountains.

#### Function `func_2`
The function `func_2` reads the input, processes each test case, and calculates the results.

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Calculating `alpha`**: For each test case, it calculates `alpha` as \((n * m + 1) // 2\). This is indeed the middle cell in a grid, but it does not account for the path constraints or the fountains.
3. **Processing Fountains**: For each fountain, it calls `func_1` to determine the additional area Alice can gain if the fountain is given to her. The results are stored in `additional_areas`.

The main issue with the program is the calculation of `alpha`. The current formula \((n * m + 1) // 2\) assumes that Alice can split the grid exactly in half, which is not always true due to the constraints of the path and the fountains. The formula also does not account for the fact that Alice must start from the left or top boundary and end at (n, 1).

Given the problem constraints and the need to correctly handle the path constraints and fountains, the current implementation is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible size of Alice's plot. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
