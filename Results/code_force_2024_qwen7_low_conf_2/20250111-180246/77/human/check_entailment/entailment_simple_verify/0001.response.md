### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum area Alice can own by dividing the field under specific constraints.
   - Alice starts from the left or top boundary and moves right or down until reaching the right or bottom boundary.
   - The field is divided such that Alice owns the part including the cell (n, 1), and Bob owns the part including the cell (1, m).
   - Each fountain location affects how much of the field Alice can own, and we need to calculate the additional area Alice gains by getting each fountain.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the distance along the main diagonal from the fountain to the diagonal from (1, 1) to (n, m).
   - This distance is used to compute the additional area Alice can gain by placing the fountain at (r, c). Specifically, `max(diagonal_distance // 2, 0)` ensures that only half of the distance contributes positively to the area Alice can own.
   - The formula `abs(r + c - (n + 1)) // 2` correctly computes the diagonal distance from the fountain to the diagonal, ensuring that the result is always non-negative and halved.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calculates the required outputs.
   - It correctly initializes the total field size and the number of fountains.
   - It computes the initial area Alice can own (`alpha`) without any fountains, which is `(n * m + 1) // 2`.
   - For each fountain, it calls `func_1` to get the additional area Alice can gain if she gets that fountain.
   - Finally, it prints the results in the required format.

4. **Validation:**
   - The logic in both functions seems to align with the problem statement.
   - The calculations are correct for determining the maximum area Alice can own initially and the additional areas for each fountain.
   - The program correctly handles the input reading and processing, ensuring that the results are formatted as required.

After analyzing the program and comparing it with the provided annotations, it appears that the program correctly implements the solution for the problem. There are no logical errors or discrepancies noted in the code.
