The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads in the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of a grid, the number of fountains \(k\), and the coordinates of each fountain. It then calculates a value \(\alpha\) defined as \((n \times m + 1) // 2\). For each fountain, it calls another function `func_1` to compute an additional area related to the fountain's position. The results are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the value \(\alpha\) and a list of the computed additional areas. Finally, the function prints \(\alpha\) and the computed additional areas for each test case.
