#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or > representing the first row of the grid; the second line of each test case contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or > representing the second row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an even integer within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], `a` is a list of strings where each string represents the first row of the grid, `b` is a list of strings where each string represents the second row of the grid, for each test case, if the loop does not break, the output is 'Yes', otherwise the output is 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two rows of a grid represented as strings of '<' and '>'. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to pair each character in the first row with a character in the second row such that no two paired characters are both pointing left ('<'). If such a pairing is possible for a test case, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. After processing all test cases, the program outputs 'Yes' for test cases where a valid pairing exists and 'No' otherwise. Potential edge cases include test cases where the grid rows are empty or do not contain any '<' characters, which are handled by the current implementation.
