The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases (`t`), each involving a grid defined by two strings of length `n` (where `n` is a positive even integer). It reads the grid input for each test case and checks if a specific condition is met using `func_1(n, grid)`. If the condition is met for any test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles edge cases such as when `t` is zero (no test cases to process) and when `func_1` fails to meet the condition for all test cases.
