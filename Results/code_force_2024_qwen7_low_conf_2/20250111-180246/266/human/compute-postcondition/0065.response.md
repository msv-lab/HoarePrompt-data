`queue` is appended with the tuple `(nx, ny)`. This means that the tuple containing the new coordinates `nx` and `ny` is added to the queue. The values of `directions`, `visited[nx][ny]`, `grid[nx][ny]`, `dy`, `nx`, and `ny` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + 1`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>'`; `dy` is 1; `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
