Postcondition: **nx is x + dx, ny is y + dy, x is unchanged, y is unchanged, dx is unchanged, dy is unchanged, and (0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and visited[nx][ny] or grid[nx][ny] != '>' or dy != 1). Given the if condition (dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0)), the current value of dx is either 1 or -1 and the current value of dy is 0.**
