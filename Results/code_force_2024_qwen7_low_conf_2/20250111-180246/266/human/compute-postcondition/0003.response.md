`a` is assigned the value of the input string from the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and the grid consisting of two lines of characters) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the integer input from the user (and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even), the first line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, the second line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, `_` is 0, and `a` is the input string from the user.
