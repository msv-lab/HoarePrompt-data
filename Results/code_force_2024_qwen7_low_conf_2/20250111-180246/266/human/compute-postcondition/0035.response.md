Postcondition: ***`i` is 5, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `a[1]` is equal to `b[2]` and both are less than ('<'), `a[1]` is equal to `b[0]` and both are less than ('<'), and the string 'No' is printed to the console. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is true, then the function continues executing based on this condition. Otherwise, the function does not change these conditions and continues based on the original state.***
