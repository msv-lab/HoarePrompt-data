Postcondition: ***`directions` contains at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`. Additionally, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`. If the condition `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is true, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.***
