The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or the most nested block it is in. Since there is no loop or nested block context given in the initial state or code snippet, the only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or block.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, and we break out of the most internal loop or block.**
