The code updates `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This means that the cell at coordinates `(nx, ny)` in the `visited` grid is now marked as visited. The values of other variables such as `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and the conditions `(0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and visited[nx][ny] or grid[nx][ny] != '>' or dy != 1)` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and (0 <= `nx` < 2 and 0 <= `ny` < n and `visited[ nx ][ ny ]` is `True` or `grid[ nx ][ ny ] != '>' or `dy` != 1), given that the current value of `dx` is either 1 or -1 and the current value of `dy` is 0.**
