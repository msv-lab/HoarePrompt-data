The code updates the values of `nx` and `ny` to `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The previous values of `nx` and `ny` are replaced by these new values, while the other variables (`x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`) remain unchanged. The condition `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` ensures that `ny` remains valid and within the specified range.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` holds true.**
