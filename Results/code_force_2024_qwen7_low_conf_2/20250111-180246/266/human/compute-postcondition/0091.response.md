The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Based on the initial state, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` appended from the code.**
