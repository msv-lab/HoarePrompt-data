The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not change any variable values but indicates that the string 'No' was printed. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `a[1]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[2]` (which is `b[2]`) and both are less than ('<'), `a[1]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[0]` (which is `b[0]`) and both are less than ('<'), and the string 'No' is printed to the console.**
