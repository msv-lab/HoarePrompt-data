The code `b = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, the grid consisting of two lines each with `n` characters, `_`, and `a`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the integer input from the user (and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even), the first line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, the second line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, `_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user**
