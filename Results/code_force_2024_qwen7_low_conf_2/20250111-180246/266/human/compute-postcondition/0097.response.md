Postcondition: ***`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '>'` and `dy == 1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`. Otherwise, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts, as well as the initial conditions provided in the precondition.
