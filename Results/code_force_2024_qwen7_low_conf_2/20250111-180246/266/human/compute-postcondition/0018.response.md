Output State: **`i` is a multiple of 2 and is the largest such value less than `n`, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user. If for any `i` in the range 1 to `i-1`, the condition `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is satisfied, the loop breaks and prints 'No'. Otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'Yes'.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over odd indices starting from 1 up to `n-1` in steps of 2. It checks the specified conditions for each index `i`.
- If any of these conditions are met for any `i` in the range 1 to `i-1`, the loop will print 'No' and break.
- If none of the conditions are met for any `i` in the range 1 to `i-1`, the loop will complete its iterations and print 'Yes'.

Since the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration and stops when `i` is the largest multiple of 2 less than `n`, the final value of `i` will be the largest even number less than `n`.
