The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most nested block of code. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block around the `break` statement, it will simply cause the program to exit the current context, which in this scenario is implied to be the current function or script. The values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `a[1]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[2]` (which is `b[2]`) and both are less than ('<'), `a[1]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[0]` (which is `b[0]`) and both are less than ('<'), and the string 'No' is printed to the console.**
