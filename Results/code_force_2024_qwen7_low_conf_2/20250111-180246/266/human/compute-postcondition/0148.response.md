The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `grid`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `grid` is a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters, and each character is either '<' or '>'.

The function has multiple return points:
- **Case_1**: The program returns `True`.
- **Case_2**: The program returns `True`.
- **Case_3**: `directions` contains all possible directions, `nx` is the value of `x + dx` of the removed tuple, `ny` is the value of `y + dy` of the removed tuple, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` for all processed positions, `grid[nx][ny]` is either '<', '>', or '-' for all processed positions, `queue` does not contain the tuple `(nx, ny)` as it just removed it, and `x` and `y` are the values of `nx` and `ny` of the removed tuple, and the program returns `True`.
- **Case_4**: The program returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of two strings `grid` and return `True` in certain conditions, and `False` in other conditions based on the described cases.
