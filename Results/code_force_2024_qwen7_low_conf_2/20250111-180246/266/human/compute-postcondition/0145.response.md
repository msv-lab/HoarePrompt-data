Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true. For all processed positions `(nx, ny)`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue` if either `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1` or `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1` or `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`. In all other cases, `visited[nx][ny]` remains unchanged and `(nx, ny)` is not in `queue`.**
