Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `a` is a list of strings.
   - `b` is a list of strings.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `(i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 to `n-1` with a step of 2 (`range(1, n, 2)`).

3. **Analyze the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's assume `i` is currently some value, say `k`, at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 1 < n` must be true.
   - Additionally, either `a[k] == b[k + 1] == '<'` or `a[k] == b[k - 1] == '<'` must be true.

4. **Determine Next Value of `i`:**
   - The next value of `i` would be `k + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k + 2` must be within the valid range (`1` to `n-1`), meaning `k + 2 < n` should hold true.
   - Also, the condition `(a[k + 2] == b[k + 3] == '<' or a[k + 2] == b[k + 1] == '<')` must be checked.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - Since `i` increases by 2 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - The condition checks for indices `k + 2` and `k + 3` in lists `a` and `b` respectively.

Given this analysis, we can summarize the new state as:

**State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and the condition for the next iteration is `(i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))` must be satisfied.** 

If the specific values of `i`, `a`, and `b` were given, we would replace `k` with the actual value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. However, without specific values, we express it in terms of `k`.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and the condition for the next iteration is `(i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))` must be satisfied.**
