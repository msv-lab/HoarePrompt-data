The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively, and `dy` is specifically `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + 1`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `>`, `queue` contains `(nx, ny)`**
