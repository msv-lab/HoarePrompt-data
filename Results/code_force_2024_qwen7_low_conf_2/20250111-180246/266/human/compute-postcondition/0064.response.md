The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. The value of `nx` is `x + dx`, and the value of `ny` is `y + dy`. Given that `dx` is between 0 and 1 and `dy` is 1, `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + 1`. The state of `directions`, `nx`, `ny`, `visited[nx][ny]`, `grid[nx][ny]`, and `dy` changes accordingly.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element; `nx` is `x + dx`; `ny` is `y + 1`; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `grid[nx][ny]` is `'>'`; `dy` is 1**
