The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True` and adds `(nx, ny)` to `queue` under specific conditions involving `grid[nx][ny]`, `dx`, and `dy`. Regardless of these conditions, `nx` and `ny` remain unchanged and are within the specified range (`0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n`). Since no other variables are affected, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`.**
