The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most innermost block it is in. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block around the `break` statement, it simply exits the current context without changing any variable values.

The output state remains the same as the initial state because the `break` statement does not affect any variable values.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[i+1]` (which is `b[2]`) and both are less than ('<'), or `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]`) and both are less than ('<'), and the string 'No' is printed to the console.**
