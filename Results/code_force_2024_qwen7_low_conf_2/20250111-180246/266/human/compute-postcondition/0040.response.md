`b` is assigned the value of the string input from the user using `input()`. The value of `i` remains the largest multiple of 2 less than `n`, `_` remains 1, `a` remains the string input from the user, `b` is updated to the new string input from the user, `t` remains greater than 0, and the first two lines of the grid remain as exactly `n` characters < and/or >.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 2 less than `n`, `_` is 1, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `b` is the string input from the user.**
