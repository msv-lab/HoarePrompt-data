`queue` is appended with the tuple `(nx, ny)`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and the condition `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` remain unchanged. The `visited[nx][ny]` variable's state is also unaffected.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` holds true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `queue` contains `(nx, ny)`**
