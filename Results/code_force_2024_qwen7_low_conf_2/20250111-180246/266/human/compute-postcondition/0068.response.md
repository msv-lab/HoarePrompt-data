The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This changes the state of the `visited` array at the position `[nx][ny]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. Additionally, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`. The condition `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is true.**
