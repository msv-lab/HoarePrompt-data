According to the given for loop, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 2 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5]
- The first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>` and `_` is 0
- `a` is the input string from the user
- `b` is the string input from the user

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration and the loop increments `i` by 2, the new value of `i` will be 5. 

Since `n` is even and within the specified range, it remains unchanged. The first two lines of the grid, `_`, `a`, and `b` also remain unchanged as no modifications were made to these variables within the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>`, `_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user.**
