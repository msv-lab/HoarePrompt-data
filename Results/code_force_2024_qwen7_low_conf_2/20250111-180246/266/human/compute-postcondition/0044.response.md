The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that is explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect the variables directly. However, it indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we are in.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is an integer
- `a` is a list of strings
- `b` is a list of strings
- The condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, leading to the print statement 'No'.

Since the `break` statement is used without a surrounding loop or conditional block, it doesn't change the values of the variables. The print statement 'No' has already been executed, but the `break` statement doesn't affect the variables or the condition.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true.**
