Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 2`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings. If the condition `(i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block. If the condition is false, no action is taken, and the program continues as usual.***
