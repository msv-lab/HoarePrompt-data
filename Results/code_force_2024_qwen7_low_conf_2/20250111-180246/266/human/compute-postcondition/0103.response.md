Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over `directions`, which is a collection of tuples `(dx, dy)`. Each iteration of the loop considers one direction from the `directions` list.

2. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `directions` contains all possible directions.
   - `nx` is the value of `x + dx` of the removed tuple.
   - `ny` is the value of `y + dy` of the removed tuple.
   - `nx` is between 0 and 1.
   - `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`.
   - `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` for all processed positions.
   - `grid[nx][ny]` is either '<', '>', or '-' for all processed positions.
   - `queue` does not contain the tuple `(nx, ny)` as it just removed it.
   - `x` and `y` are the values of `nx` and `ny` of the removed tuple.
   - The program returns `True` if `x == 1 and y == n - 1`, otherwise the program continues without returning anything.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute, `directions` must not be empty. If `directions` is empty, the loop won't run.
   - Since `nx` and `ny` are derived from `dx` and `dy`, we don't need to explicitly adjust their values unless they need to be in a specific state to proceed with the loop logic.
   - The conditions on `nx` and `ny` (being within bounds and `visited[nx][ny]` being `True`) are already given and ensure that the coordinates are valid for the grid.
   - `grid[nx][ny]` being either '<', '>', or '-' ensures that the cell is a valid path in the grid.
   - `queue` not containing `(nx, ny)` ensures that we do not process the same position multiple times.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that there are valid directions to iterate over. Hence, `directions` must be non-empty.
   - The initial values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from the removed tuple `(x, y)` and the direction `(dx, dy)`, so no explicit adjustment is needed for these values.
   - No adjustments are needed for `visited[nx][ny]` as it is already `True` for processed positions.
   - No adjustments are needed for `grid[nx][ny]` as it is already checked to be one of '<', '>', or '-'.
   - The condition `x == 1 and y == n - 1` is not relevant for the loop execution itself but for the return condition at the end.

Based on this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `directions` is non-empty, allowing the loop to execute.

**State:**
**`directions` must be non-empty.**
