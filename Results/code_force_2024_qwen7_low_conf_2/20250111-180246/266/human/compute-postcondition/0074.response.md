To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `directions` contains at least one element.
   - `nx = x + dx` and `ny = y + dy`.
   - `nx` is between 0 and 1.
   - `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`.
   - `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`.
   - `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`.
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - Otherwise, if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `directions`, the only state that changes is the current direction being processed (`dx, dy`).
   - After processing the current direction, the next direction from `directions` will be taken.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one remaining direction in `directions`.
   - Therefore, `directions` must contain at least one element.

5. **Other States:**
   - `nx` and `ny` will be updated based on the new `dx` and `dy` values.
   - `visited[nx][ny]` should still be `False` for the new position.
   - `grid[nx][ny]` should still not be `'>'` or `dy` should not be `-1` for the new position.
   - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` should contain the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
   - Otherwise, if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` should contain the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

### Final State for Next Iteration:
- `directions` must contain at least one element.
- `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy` for the next direction.
- `nx` is between 0 and 1.
- `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`.
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`.
- `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`.
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- Otherwise, if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

**State:**
- **`directions` must contain at least one element.**
- **`nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy` for the next direction.**
- **`nx` is between 0 and 1.**
- **`ny` is between 0 and `n-1`.**
- **`visited[nx][ny]` is `False`.**
- **`grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`.**
- **If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.**
- **Otherwise, if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.**

**State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx` and `ny` is `y + dy` for the next direction, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**.
