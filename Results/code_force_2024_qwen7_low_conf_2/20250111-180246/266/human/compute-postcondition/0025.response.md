The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[i+1]` (which is `b[2]`) and both are less than ('<'), or `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is equal to `b[i-1]` (which is `b[0]`) and both are less than ('<'), and the string 'No' is printed to the console.**
