Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `queue` contains the element `(nx, ny)` if `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`; otherwise, `visited[nx][ny]` remains unchanged and `(nx, ny)` is not in `queue`.***
