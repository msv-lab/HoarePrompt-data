The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `a`, or `b`. The condition involving `i`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and either `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`. We print 'No' to the console.**
