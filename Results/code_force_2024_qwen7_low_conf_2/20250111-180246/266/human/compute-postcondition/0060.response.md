The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` sets the value of `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. Given the initial conditions, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`, and `dy` is `-1`**
