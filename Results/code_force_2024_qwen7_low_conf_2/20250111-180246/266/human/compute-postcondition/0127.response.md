`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the specific cell `(nx, ny)` in the `visited` matrix is marked as visited. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` holds true, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`**
