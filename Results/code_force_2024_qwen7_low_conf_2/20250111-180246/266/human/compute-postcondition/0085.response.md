Postcondition: ***`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `False`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` regardless of the condition evaluated in the if statement.***

Explanation: 
- If the condition `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and (not visited[nx][ny])` is true, `queue` will contain the tuple `(nx, ny)` because the if part explicitly states this.
- If the condition is false (i.e., it enters the else part which is essentially none in this case), the state of `queue` remains unchanged as no other operations are performed. However, from the if part, we know that regardless of the condition's truth value, `queue` will contain the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

Thus, the final state of the program includes the conditions specified in the if part, ensuring `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
