According to the given for loop statement and the conditions provided, we need to determine which states should be updated for the loop to execute one more time.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 3 (this is the current value at the end of the previous iteration)
   - `n` is at least 3
   - `_` is 0
   - `a` is the string input from the user
   - `b` is the string input from the user
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - The first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>`
   - `a[1]` is equal to `b[2]` and both are less than ('<')
   - `a[1]` is equal to `b[0]` and both are less than ('<')
   - The string 'No' is printed to the console

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1` with a step of 2 (`range(1, n, 2)`).

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 2 (since the step is 2).
   - Therefore, `i` should be 5.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i + 1 < n`.
   - With `i` now being 5, `i + 1` would be 6.
   - Since `n` is at least 3, `6 < n` must be true for the loop to continue.

6. **Other States:**
   - `_` remains 0.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - The first two lines of the grid and the equality conditions (`a[1]` and `b[0], b[2]`) remain the same.
   - The string 'No' is still printed to the console.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `i` is 5
- `n` is at least 3
- `_` is 0
- `a` is the string input from the user
- `b` is the string input from the user
- `t` is greater than 0
- The first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>`
- `a[1]` is equal to `b[2]` and both are less than ('<')
- `a[1]` is equal to `b[0]` and both are less than ('<')
- The string 'No' is printed to the console

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is at least 3, `_` is 0, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `a[1]` is equal to `b[2]` and both are less than ('<'), `a[1]` is equal to `b[0]` and both are less than ('<'), and the string 'No' is printed to the console.**
