The code `x, y = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the queue and assigns its first and second elements to `x` and `y` respectively. Since `queue` contains at least one tuple `(nx, ny)` that satisfies the conditions, `x` and `y` will be assigned the values of `nx` and `ny` of that tuple.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`directions` contains all possible directions, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` for all processed positions, `grid[nx][ny]` is either '<', '>', or '-' for all processed positions, `queue` does not contain the tuple `(nx, ny)` it just removed, and `x` and `y` are the values of `nx` and `ny` of the removed tuple.**
