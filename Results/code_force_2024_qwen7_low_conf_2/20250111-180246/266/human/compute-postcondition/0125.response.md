`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. This changes the state of the `visited` array at the index `[nx][ny]`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `n` remain unchanged. The condition `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` also remains true.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` holds true.**
