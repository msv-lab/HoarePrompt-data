`nx` is assigned the value `x + dx`, and `ny` is assigned the value `y + dy`. The initial values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` are not specified, but these assignments update the values of `nx` and `ny`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged.**
