The code snippet `a = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` from the string input by the user but does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 2 less than `n`, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], `_` is 1, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, `t` is greater than 0, the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `n` is now an input integer.**
