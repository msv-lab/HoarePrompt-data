The code `queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple containing the values of `nx` and `ny` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions, the following values are known:

- `nx` is `x + dx`
- `ny` is `y + dy`
- `nx` is between 0 and 1
- `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`
- `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'`
- `dy` is not `-1`
- The condition `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is true

Since the `queue` is being appended with the tuple `(nx, ny)`, the values of `nx` and `ny` are added to the `queue`. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'`, `dy` is not `-1`, the condition `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))` is true, and `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
