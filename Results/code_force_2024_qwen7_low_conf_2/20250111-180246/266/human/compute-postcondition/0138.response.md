`queue.append((nx, ny))` appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. The values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`; `queue` now includes the additional element `(nx, ny)`.
Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`; `queue` now includes the additional element `(nx, ny)`**
