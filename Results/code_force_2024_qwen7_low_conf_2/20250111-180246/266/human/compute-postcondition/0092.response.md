The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This changes the state of the `visited` variable at the specific index `[nx][ny]`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state. 

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` regardless of the condition evaluated in the if statement.**
