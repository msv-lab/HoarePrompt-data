`queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple containing the values of `nx` and `ny` to the list `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively, and they satisfy the conditions `(0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and visited[nx][ny] is True or grid[nx][ny] != '>' or dy != 1)`. The values of `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, (0 <= `nx` < 2 and 0 <= `ny` < n and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` or `grid[nx][ny] != '>' or `dy` != 1), queue contains the tuple (`nx`, `ny`)**
