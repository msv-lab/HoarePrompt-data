The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and the tuple `(nx, ny)` meets the specified conditions. Therefore, the tuple `(nx, ny)` is added to `queue`.

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` in addition to its previous elements.**
