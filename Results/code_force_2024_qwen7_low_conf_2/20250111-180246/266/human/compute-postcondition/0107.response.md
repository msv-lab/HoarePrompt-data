The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True`. This changes the value of the `visited` array at the position `[nx][ny]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and (0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and (not visited[nx][ny]) is False). The value of `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`, and `dy` is currently -1.**
