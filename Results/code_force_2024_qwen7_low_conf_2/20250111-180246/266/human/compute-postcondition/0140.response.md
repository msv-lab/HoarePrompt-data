The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. This operation does not change the values of `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, or `visited[nx][ny]`. It only adds a new element to the `queue`.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true; `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; `queue` contains the element `(nx, ny)` added to it.**
