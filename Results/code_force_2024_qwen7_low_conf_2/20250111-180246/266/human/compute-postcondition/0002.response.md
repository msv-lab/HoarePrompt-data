The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that `t` is the integer input from the user, and `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even. After executing the code, `t` remains unchanged, but `n` is now assigned the value of the integer input from the user.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input from the user, `n` is the integer input from the user (and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even), the first line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, the second line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, `_` is 0**
