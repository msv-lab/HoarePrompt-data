Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `nx` is `x + dx`
   - `ny` is `y + dy`
   - `x` is unchanged
   - `y` is unchanged
   - `dx` is unchanged
   - `dy` is unchanged
   - `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true.
   - Conditions for adding `(nx, ny)` to `queue` and marking `visited[nx][ny]` as `True`:
     - If `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`
     - If `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1`
     - If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for (dx, dy) in directions:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if there are still elements in `directions` to iterate over.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the tuple `(dx, dy)` from `directions` is the next one to be processed.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through `directions`, the values of `dx` and `dy` will change to the next tuple in the list.
   - The states of `nx` and `ny` will depend on the new values of `dx` and `dy`.

5. **New State**:
   - `nx` will be updated to `x + new_dx`
   - `ny` will be updated to `y + new_dy`
   - `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
   - `dx` and `dy` will be the new values from the `directions` list.
   - The conditions for adding `(nx, ny)` to `queue` and marking `visited[nx][ny]` as `True` will depend on the new values of `new_dx`, `new_dy`, and `grid[nx][ny]`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State**: **`nx` is `x + new_dx`, `ny` is `y + new_dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is `new_dx`, `dy` is `new_dy`, and `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true. If `grid[nx][ny] == '<' and dy == -1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`. If `grid[nx][ny] == '>' and dy == 1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`. If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`. In all other cases, `visited[nx][ny]` remains unchanged and `(nx, ny)` is not in `queue`.
