The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` remain as `x + dx` and `y + dy` respectively. The states of the other variables such as `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `visited[nx][ny]` are not affected.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`; queue contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**
