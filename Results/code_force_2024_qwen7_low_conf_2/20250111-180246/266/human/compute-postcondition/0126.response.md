The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. This does not change the values of the individual variables `nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `n`, or the value of `visited[nx][ny]`, but it adds the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The condition `0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n` is also still valid.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.**
