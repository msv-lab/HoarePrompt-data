The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>` and `_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user.**
