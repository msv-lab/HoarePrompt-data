The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are derived from `x + dx` and `y + dy`, respectively. The conditions for appending to the queue are specified, but they do not affect the final values of `nx` and `ny`, which are already determined by the initial state. The `queue` now includes the tuple `(nx, ny)`. 

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, and now `queue` also contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.**
