`visited[nx][ny]` is assigned the value `True`. This means that the specific cell in the `visited` array at index `[nx][ny]` is marked as visited. The values of the other variables (`nx`, `ny`, `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`) remain unchanged, and the conditions `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` still hold true.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.**
