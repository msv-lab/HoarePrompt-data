Let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial Information:
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is `k + 2`
  - `a` is a list of strings
  - `b` is a list of strings
- The condition for breaking out of the loop is: 
  \[
  (i + 1 < n \text{ and } (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' \text{ or } a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))
  \]
- If the condition is false, the loop continues.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs in steps of 2 starting from 1 to `n-1`, so the loop condition is `1 <= i < n`.

2. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 2`.

3. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 2` must still be within the bounds of the range, i.e., `1 <= i + 2 < n`.
   - This simplifies to `1 <= k + 2 < n`.

4. **Condition for Breaking Out of the Loop:**
   - The condition to check is:
     \[
     (i + 1 < n \text{ and } (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' \text{ or } a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))
     \]
   - Substituting `i = k + 2` into the condition:
     \[
     ((k + 2) + 1 < n \text{ and } (a[k + 2] == b[k + 3] == '<' \text{ or } a[k + 2] == b[k + 1] == '<'))
     \]
     Simplifies to:
     \[
     (k + 3 < n \text{ and } (a[k + 2] == b[k + 3] == '<' \text{ or } a[k + 2] == b[k + 1] == '<'))
     \]

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes `k + 4`.
   - The list bounds condition `1 <= k + 4 < n` must hold true.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop will use `i = k + 4`:
     \[
     (k + 4 + 1 < n \text{ and } (a[k + 4] == b[k + 5] == '<' \text{ or } a[k + 4] == b[k + 3] == '<'))
     \]
     Simplifies to:
     \[
     (k + 5 < n \text{ and } (a[k + 4] == b[k + 5] == '<' \text{ or } a[k + 4] == b[k + 3] == '<'))
     \]

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is now `k + 4`
- `a` is a list of strings
- `b` is a list of strings
- The condition for breaking out of the loop remains the same but evaluated with `i = k + 4`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is `k + 4`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings**

The condition for breaking out of the loop will now evaluate using `i = k + 4`.
