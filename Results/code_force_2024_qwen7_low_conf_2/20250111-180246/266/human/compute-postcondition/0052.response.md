The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given initial state, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 4`, `a` is a list of strings and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
