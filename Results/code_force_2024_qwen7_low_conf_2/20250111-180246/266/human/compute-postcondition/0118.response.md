Postcondition: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + 1` if `grid[nx][ny]` is `>` and `dy` is `1`. In this case, `queue` contains `(nx, ny)` and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`. Otherwise, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, (0 <= `nx` < 2 and 0 <= `ny` < n and `visited[nx][ny]` is `True` or `grid[nx][ny] != '>' or `dy` != 1). If `dx == 1 and dy == 0` or `dx == -1 and dy == 0`, then `queue` contains the tuple (`nx`, `ny`). No other changes occur in other cases.**
