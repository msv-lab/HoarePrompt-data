Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings, and `b` is a list of strings. If the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, then the postcondition is satisfied as per the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition simply follows the if part's condition.***
