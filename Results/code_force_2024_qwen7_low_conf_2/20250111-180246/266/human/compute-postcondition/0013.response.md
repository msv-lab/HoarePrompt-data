Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
