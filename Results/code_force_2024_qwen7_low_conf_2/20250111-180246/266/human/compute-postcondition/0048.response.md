The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that the condition `(i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))` was checking. However, since there is no loop or further code after the `break` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.**
