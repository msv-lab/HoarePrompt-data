The code `visited[nx][ny] = True` assigns the value `True` to the element `visited[nx][ny]`. Given the initial conditions:

- `nx` is `x + dx`
- `ny` is `y + dy`
- `grid[nx][ny]` is `>`
- `dy` is `1`

All other variables (`x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `n`, `visited`, and `grid`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `visited[nx][ny]` being set to `True`.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is `1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `grid[nx][ny]` is `>`**
