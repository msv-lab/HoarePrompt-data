The code `print('No')` prints the string 'No' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'No' is printed.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is even and within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], the first two lines of the grid consist of exactly `n` characters < and/or >, `_` is 0, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the string input from the user, the condition `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')` is true, 'No' is printed to the console.**
