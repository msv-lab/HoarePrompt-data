The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The constraints and relationships between the input parameters are provided in the problem description but not within the function definition itself.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `n` is even.
- The first line of each test case contains a string consisting of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>` representing the first row of the grid.
- The second line of each test case contains a string consisting of exactly `n` characters `<` and/or `>` representing the second row of the grid.

The function likely processes these inputs and returns some output based on the given conditions, but the specific return value is not mentioned in the provided function signature.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters.**
