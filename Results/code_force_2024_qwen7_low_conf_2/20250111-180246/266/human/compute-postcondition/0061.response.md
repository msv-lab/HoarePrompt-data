`queue.append((nx, ny))` appends a tuple containing the values of `nx` and `ny` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, and `dy` is `-1`. The values of `nx` and `ny` are within the specified ranges, and the other variables (`directions`, `visited[nx][ny]`, and `grid[nx][ny]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`directions` contains at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y - 1`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`, `queue` contains a tuple `(nx, ny)`, and `dy` is `-1`**
