Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an even integer within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], `a` is a list of strings where each string represents the first row of the grid, `b` is a list of strings where each string represents the second row of the grid, for each test case, if the loop does not break, the output is 'Yes', otherwise the output is 'No'.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each test case specified by `t`.
- For each test case, `n` is read, and two strings `a` and `b` are read representing the rows of the grid.
- The inner loop checks whether for any `i` (where `i` is odd and within the range 1 to `n-1`), the conditions `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` are satisfied.
- If any of these conditions are met, the loop prints 'No' and breaks, thus the loop does not continue to the next iteration of the outer loop.
- If the inner loop completes without breaking, the loop prints 'Yes'.

After all iterations of the outer loop have finished, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the input provided for each test case. If the loop did not break for any test case, 'Yes' is printed for that test case, otherwise 'No' is printed.
