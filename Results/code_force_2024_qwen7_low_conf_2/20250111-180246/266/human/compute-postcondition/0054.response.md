Output State: **`i` is the largest multiple of 2 less than `n`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and the loop has either printed 'No' and broken out of the loop, or it has printed 'Yes' and continued to check the conditions for subsequent iterations without breaking out.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs in increments of 2 starting from the largest even number less than `n`.
- For each iteration, the loop checks the conditions `(i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<')`.
- If any of these conditions are true, the loop prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop immediately.
- If none of these conditions are true for any iteration, the loop continues until it has checked all valid `i` values, then it prints 'Yes'.

Given that the loop will either break or continue checking until it reaches its end, the final state depends on whether the conditions were ever met:
- If the conditions are met at any point, the loop will print 'No' and stop.
- If the conditions are never met, the loop will print 'Yes' after all valid `i` values have been checked.

Thus, the final output state captures both scenarios based on the loop's behavior.
