The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`. Given the initial conditions:

- `directions` must contain at least one element.
- `nx` is `x + dx`.
- `ny` is `y + dy`.
- `nx` is between 0 and 1.
- `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`.
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.
- `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`.
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- Otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- And `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)` regardless of the condition evaluated in the if statement.

Since the `queue.append((nx, ny))` operation adds the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the `queue`, the updated state is:

- `directions` must contain at least one element.
- `nx` is `x + dx`.
- `ny` is `y + dy`.
- `nx` is between 0 and 1.
- `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`.
- `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`.
- `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`.
- If `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- Otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.
- And `queue` now definitely contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`.

Output State: **`directions` must contain at least one element, `nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `nx` is between 0 and 1, `ny` is between 0 and `n-1`, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, `grid[nx][ny]` is not `'>'` or `dy` is not `-1`, if `grid[nx][ny] == '<'` and `dy == -1`, then `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, otherwise if `(dx == 1 and dy == 0 or (dx == -1 and dy == 0))`, `queue` contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`, and `queue` now contains the tuple `(nx, ny)`**.
