The code sets `visited[nx][ny]` to `True` and adds `(nx, ny)` to `queue`. This impacts the `visited` and `queue` variables.

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, `0 <= nx < 2` and `0 <= ny < n` hold true, `visited[nx][ny]` is `True`, and `(nx, ny)` is in `queue`.**
