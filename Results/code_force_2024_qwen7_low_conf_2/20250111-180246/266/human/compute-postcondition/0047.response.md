The code `print('No')` simply prints the string 'No' and does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `a`, `b`, or the condition for the next iteration. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `a` is a list of strings, `b` is a list of strings, and the condition for the next iteration is `(i + 1 < n and (a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'))` must be satisfied.**
