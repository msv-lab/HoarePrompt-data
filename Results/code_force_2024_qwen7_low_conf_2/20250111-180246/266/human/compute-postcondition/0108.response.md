The code appends the tuple `(nx, ny)` to the list `queue`. The values of `nx` and `ny` remain the same as they were before the code execution. The other variables such as `x`, `y`, `dx`, `dy`, `grid`, `visited`, and `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and (0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < n and (not visited[nx][ny]) is False); `grid[nx][ny]` is `<`; `dy` is currently -1; `(nx, ny)` is appended to `queue`.**
