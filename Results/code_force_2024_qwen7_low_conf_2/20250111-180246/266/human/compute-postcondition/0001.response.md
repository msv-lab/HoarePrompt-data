State: **`t` is the integer input from the user, n is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even, the first line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, the second line of the grid consists of exactly n characters < and/or >, `_` is 0**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **`t`**: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer, and it represents the number of test cases. Therefore, `t` needs to be set as the result of the user's input.

2. **`n`**: The problem states that `n` is within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and is even. This condition must be satisfied for the loop to proceed. However, since `n` is already defined and within the specified range, no adjustment is needed for this specific variable.

3. **Grid Representation**: The grid is represented by two lines, each containing exactly `n` characters that are either `<` or `>`. These conditions are part of the initial setup and do not change within the loop itself. Thus, they remain as given.

4. **Loop Variable `_`**: The loop variable `_` (often used as a placeholder when the loop variable itself is not needed) starts at 0. Since the loop will increment `_` with each iteration, it should begin at 0.

Therefore, the required adjustments to the state before the loop executes are summarized as above.
