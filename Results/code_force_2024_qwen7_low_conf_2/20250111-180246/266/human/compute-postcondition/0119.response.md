Postcondition: ***`nx` is `x + dx`, `ny` is `y + dy`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `dx` is unchanged, `dy` is unchanged, and (0 <= `nx` < 2 and 0 <= `ny` < n). If `grid[nx][ny]` is `<` and `dy` is -1, then `(nx, ny)` is appended to `queue` and `visited[nx][ny]` remains `False`. Otherwise, if `grid[nx][ny]` is `>` and `dy` is 1, then `ny` becomes `y + 1`, `(nx, ny)` is appended to `queue`, and `visited[nx][ny]` is set to `True`. In all other cases, `nx` remains `x + dx` and `ny` remains `y + dy`, with no other changes.***
