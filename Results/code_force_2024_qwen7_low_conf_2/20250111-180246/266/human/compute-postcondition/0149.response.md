Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and `grid` (a list of two strings where each string consists of exactly `n` characters, and each character is either '<' or '>'). The function aims to determine whether there exists a path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (1, n-1) in the grid, following the direction indicated by each character ('<' for left and '>' for right). The function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the grid. If a valid path is found, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

After the function concludes, the final state of the program will be:
- The `visited` matrix, which keeps track of visited positions, will be updated for all positions that were processed during the BFS.
- The `queue` will be empty since all elements have been processed.
- The `directions` list contains all possible directions (up, down, left, right).
- The function returns `True` if there is a path from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), otherwise it returns `False`.

Potential edge cases include:
- If `n` is less than 2 or greater than 2⋅10^5, the function will not execute correctly due to the specified constraints.
- If the grid contains characters other than '<' or '>', the function will still attempt to process them, but only '<' and '>' will affect the pathfinding logic.
- If there is no valid path from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), the function will return `False` after fully exploring the grid.**

This summary covers all aspects of the function's behavior and includes the potential edge cases and missing functionality based on the actual code.
