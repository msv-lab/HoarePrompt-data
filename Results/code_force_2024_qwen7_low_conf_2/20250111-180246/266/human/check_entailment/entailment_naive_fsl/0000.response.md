Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions related to the arrows and prints 'No' prematurely without properly evaluating all possible paths.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
6
>>>><<
<<>>><
```

In this case, the robot can move as follows:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2) and then down to (2, 2).
3. Move right to (2, 3) and then down to (1, 3).
4. Move right to (1, 4) and then down to (2, 4).

However, the program will incorrectly print 'No' because it only checks the positions at odd indices and does not account for the full traversal of the grid. This check is insufficient and leads to incorrect results for many valid paths.
