You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the first line of each test case contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or > representing the first row of the grid; the second line of each test case contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or > representing the second row of the grid.

    t = int(input())

                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an even integer within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], `a` is a list of strings where each string represents the first row of the grid, `b` is a list of strings where each string represents the second row of the grid, for each test case, if the loop does not break, the output is 'Yes', otherwise the output is 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two rows of a grid represented as strings of '<' and '>'. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to pair each character in the first row with a character in the second row such that no two paired characters are both pointing left ('<'). If such a pairing is possible for a test case, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. After processing all test cases, the program outputs 'Yes' for test cases where a valid pairing exists and 'No' otherwise. Potential edge cases include test cases where the grid rows are empty or do not contain any '<' characters, which are handled by the current implementation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided Python function, let's analyze it step-by-step based on the problem requirements and constraints.

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Grid Input**: For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, and the two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows.
3. **Movement Validation**:
   - The loop checks every second column (i.e., every odd-indexed column, since indexing starts at 0).
   - It checks if the current cell in the first row and the adjacent cells in the second row allow movement to the desired position (2, n).
   - Specifically, it checks if both the current cell in the first row (`a[i]`) and either the next or previous cell in the second row (`b[i+1]` or `b[i-1]`) have an arrow pointing left ('<'). If so, this indicates the robot cannot reach (2, n).

However, there are issues with the logic for determining if the robot can reach (2, n):

- The current implementation incorrectly assumes that if any such pair of cells exist where the robot would need to move left and both conditions are met, the robot cannot reach (2, n). This is overly restrictive because it fails to consider other possible valid paths that might bypass these cells.
- The use of `break` inside the loop immediately prints 'No' upon finding a single invalid pair, without checking further cells. This could lead to incorrect results for some cases where the robot can still potentially reach (2, n).

The provided solution does not fully address the problem. Instead of focusing on invalid pairs, we should ensure that there is a valid path from (1, 1) to (2, n).

**Correctness: False**

A more accurate approach would involve simulating the robot's movement and verifying if it can reach the target cell (2, n) while adhering to the grid rules.
