Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two rows of a grid represented as strings of '<' and '>'. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to pair each character in the first row with a character in the second row such that no two paired characters are both pointing left ('<'). If such a pairing is possible for a test case, the function prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing. After processing all test cases, the program outputs 'Yes' for test cases where a valid pairing exists and 'No' otherwise. Potential edge cases include test cases where the grid rows are empty or do not contain any '<' characters, which are handled by the current implementation.
