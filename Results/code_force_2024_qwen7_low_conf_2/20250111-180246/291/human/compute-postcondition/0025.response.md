Let's break down the task step by step.

### Initial State
The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
- The value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\)

### Loop Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that the loop will run for a number of iterations specified by the user input. Let's denote the number of iterations by \( k \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the number of iterations**: The number of iterations is determined by the user input. Let's say the user inputs \( k \).
2. **Initial state**: We know the value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) at the end of the previous iteration.
3. **Loop Execution**: For each iteration, the value of \(\text{sum}(a)\) and \(_acc\) will change based on the loop body (which is omitted). However, we only need to consider how many more iterations are left to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
4. **Next Iteration State**: Since the loop runs for \( k \) times, if this is the \( i \)-th iteration (where \( i < k \)), then there are \( k - i \) iterations left.

### Adjusted State
Since the loop is about to execute another iteration, we need to adjust the state accordingly. The value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) will remain the same unless the loop body changes it, but for the purpose of determining the number of iterations left, we don't need to change it explicitly.

The key point is that there is one more iteration left before the loop ends.

### Final State
State: **the value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) remains the same, and there is one more iteration left**

In a more precise format:
State: **the value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) remains the same, and there is one more iteration left**
