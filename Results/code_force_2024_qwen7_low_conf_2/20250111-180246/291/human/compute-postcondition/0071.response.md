To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables step by step.

### Initial State Recap:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1`.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop.
- `_a` is a list of integers.
- `_acc` is 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - n`.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `i` in the range `[0, k)` and updates `_acc` as follows:
```python
for i in range(k):
    _acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:
   - `_acc` becomes `_max % MOD`.

2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
   - `_acc` becomes `(2 * _acc + _max) % MOD`.

3. **Third Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
   - `_acc` becomes `(2 * (_acc + _max) % MOD + _max) % MOD`.

From the pattern, we observe that `_acc` is updated in each iteration by adding `_max` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. This can be generalized as:
- After `m` iterations, `_acc` becomes `(2^m * _acc + m * _max) % MOD`.

### Final Values After All Iterations:
- Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k - 1`, it will run exactly `k` times.
- Therefore, after `k` iterations, `_acc` will be:
  \[
  _acc = (2^k * _acc + k * _max) \% MOD
  \]

### Output State After All Iterations:
- `_acc` will be `(2^k * _acc + k * _max) \% MOD`.
- `_sum` remains unchanged because the loop only updates `_acc` and does not directly modify `_sum`.
- `_a` remains the same as the initial list of integers.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop.
- `i` will be `k` after the loop completes.
- `num_iterations` will be `num_iterations - n - k` since `num_iterations` is decremented by `n` initially and by `k` in the loop.
- `n` and `k` remain input integers.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- `_acc` is `(2^k * _acc + k * _max) \% MOD`.
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1`.
- `_a` is a list of integers.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop.
- `i` is `k`.
- `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - n - k`.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.

This captures the final state of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
