The code `_acc = 0` sets the value of `_acc` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `_acc`.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1`, _max is the maximum value of _sum calculated during the loop, _a is a list of integers, _acc is 0, i is n, num_iterations is num_iterations - n, n is an input integer, k is an input integer.**
