The code initializes `_sum` to 0. This does not affect the values of `a`, `n`, or `k`. However, it does initialize `_sum` to 0. Since the initial state of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) is no longer the same, it implies that `_acc` was previously set to a value that made the expression true, and now `_sum` being 0 means `_acc` is no longer the same. 

Output State: **`_sum` is 0, the value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) is no longer the same, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
