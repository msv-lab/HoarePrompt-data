`_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`. According to the initial state, `_sum` is `max(0, _sum + a[k+2])`, and `i` is `k + 3`. Therefore, `_sum` will be `max(0, max(0, _sum + a[k+2]) + a[k+3])`.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. So, the output state will include the updated `_sum` and retain the values of the other variables as they were initially.

Output State: **`_sum` is `max(0, max(0, _sum + a[k+2]) + a[k+3])`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[k]), max(0, _sum + a[k+2]))`, `_a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is `k * (0 % MOD)`, `i` is `k + 4`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k < n`**
