Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`
   - `_max` is `_sum`
   - `_a` is a list of integers
   - `_acc` is `k * (0 % MOD)`
   - `i` is `k`
   - `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer and `k < n`

2. **Understand the for loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine how each variable changes in the loop:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `k` and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop will iterate from `k` to `n-1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - Since the loop is about to execute again, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The number of iterations (`num_iterations`) is reduced by 1 each time the loop runs, so `num_iterations` will be `num_iterations - 1 - 1 = num_iterations - 2`.
   - All other states (`_sum`, `_max`, `_a`, `_acc`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `_sum` remains `max(0, a[k])`
   - `_max` remains `_sum`
   - `_a` remains a list of integers
   - `_acc` remains `k * (0 % MOD)`
   - `i` becomes `k + 1`
   - `num_iterations` becomes `num_iterations - 2`
   - `n` remains the same
   - `k` remains the same

Based on this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **_sum is max(0, a[k]), _max is _sum, _a is a list of integers, _acc is k * (0 % MOD), i is k + 1, num_iterations is num_iterations - 2, n is an input integer, k is an input integer and k < n**
