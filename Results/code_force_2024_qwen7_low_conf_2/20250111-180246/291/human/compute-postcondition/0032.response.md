The code sets `_max` to the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`. Given that `_max` starts as 0 and `_sum` is defined as `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, `_sum` will be at least 0.

- Initially, `_max` is 0.
- `_sum` is calculated as `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, meaning `_sum` will be the maximum of 0 and the sum of `_sum` (which is initially 0) and the current element `a[i]`.

After executing `_max = max(_max, _sum)`:

- `_max` will take the value of `_sum` because `_sum` is at least 0 and will be updated to be the maximum of itself and `_sum`.
- `_max` will be at least 0, and potentially higher depending on the values in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of `_sum` and `a[i]` are not given, the only definite change is that `_max` will now be at least 0 and possibly higher based on the sum calculation.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, _sum + a[i]), _max is at least 0 and potentially higher, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
