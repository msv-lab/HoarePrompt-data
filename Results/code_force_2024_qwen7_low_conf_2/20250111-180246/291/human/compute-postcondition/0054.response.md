According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Specifically:

- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
- Before the loop starts, `_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `_a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is \( k \times (0 \% \text{MOD}) \), `i` is `k`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`, and `n` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is initially set to `k`, we need to ensure that `k` is less than `n`.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `_sum` is 0
- `_max` is 0
- `_a` is a list of integers
- `_acc` is \( k \times (0 \% \text{MOD}) \)
- `i` is `k`
- `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `k` must be less than `n`

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`_sum` is 0, `_max` is 0, `_a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is \( k \times (0 \% \text{MOD}) \), `i` is `k`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `k` must be less than `n`**
