Output State: **\_acc is \((k \times (\_max \% 10)) \% 10\), \(t\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 10, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer from user input, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `_sum` is the maximum value of `_sum + a[i]` for all \(i\) in the range of \(n\), `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations of the loop, `i` is `k`, `i` must be less than `k`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Loop Execution:**
   - Initially, `_acc` is set to \(\_max \% 10\).
   - The loop runs for `k` iterations.
   - In each iteration, `_acc` is updated by adding \((_acc + _max) \% 10\).

2. **First Iteration:**
   - `_acc` is \((2 \times (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).
   - This can be simplified to \((2 \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - `_acc` is updated to \((\text{new}_\text{acc} + \_max) \% 10\).
   - Where \(\text{new}_\text{acc} = (2 \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).
   - So, `_acc` becomes \(((2 \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) + \_max) \% 10\).
   - Simplifying, `_acc` becomes \((3 \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).

4. **General Iteration:**
   - After `i` iterations, `_acc` is updated to \((i \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).
   - After `k` iterations, `_acc` is \((k \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).

5. **Loop Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` is equal to `k`.
   - Therefore, `_acc` is \((k \cdot (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).

6. **State of Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `MOD`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `_sum`, and `_max` do not change during the loop and retain their original values.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state of the variables is as stated above.
