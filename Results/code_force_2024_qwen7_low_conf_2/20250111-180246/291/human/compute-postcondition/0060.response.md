Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. This means that if `i` is currently `k + 2`, then the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `_sum` is updated as `max(0, _sum + a[k+1])`.
   - `_max` is updated as `max(max(0, a[k]), max(0, _sum + a[k+1]))`.
   - `_a` is a list of integers.
   - `_acc` is `k * (0 % MOD)`.
   - `i` is currently `k + 2`.
   - `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 2`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer and `k < n`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `k + 3`.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - `_sum` and `_max` might change based on the value of `a[k+2]` (since `i` is now `k + 3`).
   - `_acc` remains the same since it is not dependent on the loop variable `i`.
   - `num_iterations` will decrease by 1 more, making it `num_iterations - 3`.
   - `i` becomes `k + 3`.

5. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Since `i` is now `k + 3`, the condition `k + 3 < n` must hold true.

Putting it all together, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

- `_sum` should be updated considering `a[k+2]`.
- `_max` should be updated considering `a[k+2]`.
- `_acc` remains the same.
- `i` becomes `k + 3`.
- `num_iterations` decreases by 1 more, making it `num_iterations - 3`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `k + 3 < n`.

Thus, the final state before the next iteration is:

State: **`_sum` is `max(0, _sum + a[k+2])`, `_max` is `max(max(0, a[k]), max(0, _sum + a[k+2]))`, `_a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is `k * (0 % MOD)`, `i` is `k + 3`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k < n`**.
