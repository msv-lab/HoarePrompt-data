The code `res = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `res`. The initial state of `n` being an integer representing the number of test cases and `s` being a string representation of `n` remains unchanged. The test cases and their associated data are also unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `s` is a string representation of `n`; each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9); `res` is `-1`**
