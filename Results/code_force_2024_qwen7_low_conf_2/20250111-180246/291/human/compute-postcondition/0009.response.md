The code `break` does not change any variable values. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or loop-like construct. Since there is no loop or loop-like construct in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`total` is -1, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `res` is 0**
