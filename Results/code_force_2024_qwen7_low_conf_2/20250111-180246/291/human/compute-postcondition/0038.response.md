The code snippet updates `_max` to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`. The value of `_sum` is already updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, so `_sum` is now a non-negative value. `_max` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `_sum`.

The output state is:

**_sum is max(0, _sum + a[i]), _max is the maximum of its current value and _sum, _a is a non-empty list of integers, n must be greater than i + 1.**
