The code initializes `_sum` to 0. This means that the previous value of `_sum` (which was the maximum value of \(\max(0, _sum + a[i])\) over all iterations) is now reset to 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **_sum is 0, _max is the maximum value of \(\max(0, _sum + a[i])\) over all iterations, _a is a list of integers (input from the user), _acc is \( k \times (_max \% \text{MOD}) \), i is k, num_iterations is num_iterations - 1, n is an input integer, k is an input integer**
