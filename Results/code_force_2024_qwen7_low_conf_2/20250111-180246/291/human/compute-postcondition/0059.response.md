The code updates `_max` to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Let's denote:
- `_sum` as `max(0, _sum + a[k+1])`
- `_max` as `max(0, a[k])`
- `_a` as a list of integers
- `_acc` as `k * (0 % MOD)`
- `i` as `k + 2`
- `num_iterations` as `num_iterations - 2`
- `n` as an input integer
- `k` as an input integer and `k < n`

After executing `_max = max(_max, _sum)`, `_max` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, _sum + a[k+1]), _max is max(max(0, a[k]), max(0, _sum + a[k+1])), _a is a list of integers, _acc is k * (0 % MOD), i is k + 2, num_iterations is num_iterations - 2, n is an input integer, k is an input integer and k < n**
