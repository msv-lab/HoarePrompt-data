The code updates `_acc` by adding `( _acc + _max ) % MOD` to `_acc`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `_acc` is initially `_max % MOD`.
2. `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop, which is already defined in the initial state.
3. `_acc` is updated by adding `( _acc + _max ) % MOD` to its current value.

So, the new value of `_acc` is:
\[
\_acc = (\_acc + \_acc + \_max) \% MOD = (2 \times \_acc + \_max) \% MOD
\]

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1` after updating for `i = 1`.
- `_a` is a list of integers.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop.
- `i` is `1`.
- `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - n`.
- `n` and `k` are input integers with the condition that `i < k`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`\_acc` is `(2 \times \_acc + \_max) \% MOD`, `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1` after updating for `i = 1`, `_a` is a list of integers, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop, `i` is `1`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - n`, `n` and `k` are input integers with the condition that `i < k`.**
