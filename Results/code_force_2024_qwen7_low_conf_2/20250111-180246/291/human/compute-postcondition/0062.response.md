The code updates `_max` by taking the maximum of `_max` and `_sum`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `_sum` remains unchanged because the code does not modify `_sum`.
- `_max` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `_sum`.
- `_a`, `_acc`, `i`, `num_iterations`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **_sum is max(0, max(0, _sum + a[k+2]) + a[k+3]), _max is max(max(_max, _sum), max(0, a[k]), max(0, _sum + a[k+2])), _a is a list of integers, _acc is k * (0 % MOD), i is k + 4, num_iterations is num_iterations - 3, n is an input integer, k is an input integer and k < n**
