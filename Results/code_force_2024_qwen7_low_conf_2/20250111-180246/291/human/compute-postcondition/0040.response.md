The code initializes `_acc` to 0. This does not affect the values of `_sum`, `_max`, `_a`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the only change is that `_acc` is now 0.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum value of `max(0, _sum + a[i])` over all iterations, _max is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations, _a is a non-empty list of integers, n is the length of the list `a`, and k is an input integer, `_acc` is 0**.
