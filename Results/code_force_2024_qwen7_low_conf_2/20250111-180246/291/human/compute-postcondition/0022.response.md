The code updates the value of `_acc` by adding the result of `(_acc + _max) % MOD`. Let's break this down:

- `_acc` is initially calculated as \((2 \times (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\).
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations of the loop.
- `MOD` is 10.
- `i` is 2 and must be less than `k`.

The line `_acc += (_acc + _max) % MOD` means `_acc` is updated to `_acc + (_acc + _max) % 10`.

Since `_acc` is initially \((2 \times (\_max \% 10) + \_max) \% 10\), let's denote this initial value as `val`. So, `_acc = val`.

The updated value of `_acc` becomes:
\[ \text{_acc} = val + (val + \_max) \% 10 \]

Since `_max` is already defined and `_acc` is updated based on its value, we don't need to re-calculate `_max`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**\_acc is \(val + (val + \_max) \% 10\), \(t\) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 10, `n` is at least 1, `k` is an integer from user input, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `_sum` is the maximum value of `_sum + a[i]` for all \(i\) in the range of \(n\), `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations of the loop, `i` is 2, `i` must be less than `k`.**
