The code updates `_sum` by setting it to the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. This means `_sum` will be the greater value between 0 and the sum of `_sum` and `a[i]`. The other variables (`_max`, `_a`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Since `_sum` is updated based on the current value of `_sum` and `a[i]`, the new value of `_sum` will be `_sum + a[i]` if `_sum + a[i]` is greater than 0, otherwise, it will be 0. The preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, _sum + a[i]), _max is the maximum of its current value and _sum, _a is a non-empty list of integers, n must be greater than i + 1, _sum is updated to max(0, _sum + a[i])**
