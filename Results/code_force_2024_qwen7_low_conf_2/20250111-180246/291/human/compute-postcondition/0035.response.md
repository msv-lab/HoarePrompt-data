The code updates `_max` to the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`. Given the initial state:

- `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`
- `_max` is at least 0 and potentially higher
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers
- `n` must be greater than 0

After executing `_max = max(_max, _sum)`, `_max` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and `_sum`.

Since `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, `_sum` will be non-negative (either 0 or a positive value). Therefore, `_max` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and this non-negative value.

Output State: **_sum is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, `_max` is the maximum of its current value and `_sum`, `_a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
