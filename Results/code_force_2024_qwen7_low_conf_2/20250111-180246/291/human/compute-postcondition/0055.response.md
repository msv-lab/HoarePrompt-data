The code updates `_sum` by setting it to the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Here, `_sum` is initially 0, `a[i]` is the i-th element in the list `_a`, and `i` is equal to `k`.

Given that `_sum` starts at 0, the value of `_sum` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and the sum of 0 and `a[k]`. Since `a[k]` is an integer from the list `_a`, the new value of `_sum` will be `max(0, a[k])`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`, `_max` is 0, `_a` is a list of integers, `_acc` is \( k \times (0 \% \text{MOD}) \), `i` is `k`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `k` must be less than `n`**
