The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. This affects the variables `n` and `k` but does not change the values of `_sum`, `_max`, `_a`, `_acc`, `i`, or `num_iterations`. The initial state values for `_sum`, `_max`, `_a`, `_acc`, `i`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged.

Output State: **_sum is the maximum value of \(\max(0, _sum + a[i])\) over all iterations, _max is the maximum value of _sum over all iterations, _a is a non-empty list of integers with at least k elements, _acc is \( k \times (_max \% \text{MOD}) \), i is k, num_iterations is num_iterations - 1, n is an input integer, k is an input integer**
