`_acc` is updated to `_acc + (_acc + _max) % MOD`. Given the initial state, `_acc` is `(2 * _acc + _max) % MOD`. Since `_acc` is being added to `_acc + _max` and then taking modulo `MOD`, the new value of `_acc` is `(2 * (_acc + _max)) % MOD`.

The states of the other variables (`_sum`, `_a`, `_max`, `i`, `num_iterations`, and `k`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **_acc is (2 * (_acc + _max)) % MOD, `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1` after updating for `i = 2`, `_a` is a list of integers, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop, `i` is `2`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - n`, `k` must be greater than `2`.**
