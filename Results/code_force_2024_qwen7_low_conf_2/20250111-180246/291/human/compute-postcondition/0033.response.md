Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `_sum` is `max(0, _sum + a[i])`
   - `_max` is at least 0 and potentially higher
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `n` must be greater than 0

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Each iteration processes an element of the list `a` using the current index `i`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating from `0` to `n-1`, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was within the range `[0, n-1]` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must now be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `_sum` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted, but it should still satisfy `_sum = max(0, _sum + a[i+1])` when `i` increments.
   - `_max` remains at least 0, as the value of `_max` does not change in the loop body.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:
State: **_sum is max(0, _sum + a[i+1]), _max is at least 0 and potentially higher, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
