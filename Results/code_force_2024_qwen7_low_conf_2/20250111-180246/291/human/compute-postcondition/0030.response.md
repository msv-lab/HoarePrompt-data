Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is iterating over `range(n)`, which means `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Identify the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Identify the Relevant States**:
   - `_sum`: This variable accumulates the sum of elements in the list `a`.
   - `a`: A list of integers.
   - `n`: An integer representing the length of the list `a`.
   - `_acc`: An accumulator that might be used within the loop to modify `_sum`.
   - `_max`: Tracks the maximum value encountered in the list `a`.

4. **Initial State**:
   - `_sum` is 0.
   - The value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _\text{acc}) \% 10\) is no longer the same.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `_max` is 0.

5. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop will execute as long as `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start.
   - `a` must be a non-empty list (i.e., `len(a) >= 1`) for the loop to start.
   - The initial state of `_sum` is 0, but since the loop will iterate over `n` times, `_sum` will change if `a` contains non-zero elements.
   - `_max` is initialized to 0, and it may change during the loop iterations if `a` contains non-zero elements.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`_sum` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0, `_max` is 0**
