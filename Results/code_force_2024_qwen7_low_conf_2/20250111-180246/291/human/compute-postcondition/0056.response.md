The code `max(_max, _sum)` updates `_max` to be the maximum value between `_max` and `_sum`. Given the initial state:

- `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`
- `_max` is 0
- `_a` is a list of integers
- `_acc` is `k * (0 % MOD)`
- `i` is `k`
- `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and `k < n`

We need to determine the new value of `_max`.

Since `_max` is initially 0, and `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`, which is either 0 or `a[k]` depending on whether `a[k]` is non-negative or not, the maximum value between 0 and `_sum` will be `_sum` itself if `_sum` is non-zero.

Therefore, `_max` will be updated to `_sum`.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, a[k]), _max is _sum, _a is a list of integers, _acc is k * (0 % MOD), i is k, num_iterations is num_iterations - 1, n is an input integer, k is an input integer and k < n**
