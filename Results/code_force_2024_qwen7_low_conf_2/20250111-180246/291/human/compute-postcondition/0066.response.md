The code updates the value of `_acc` by adding `(_acc + _max) % MOD`. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. `_acc` is currently `0`.
2. `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop.
3. The expression `(_acc + _max) % MOD` will compute a new value which will be added to `_acc`.

Since `_acc` was initially `0`, the new value of `_acc` will be `_max % MOD`. 

The variables `_sum`, `_a`, `_max`, `i`, `num_iterations`, `n`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **_acc is `_max % MOD`, `_sum` is the maximum subarray sum starting from index `k` and ending at index `k + n - 1`, `_a` is a list of integers, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` calculated during the loop, `i` is `0`, `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - n`, `n` and `k` are input integers, with the condition that `i < k`.**
