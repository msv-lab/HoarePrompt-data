The code snippet calculates the sum of the list `a` and adds `_acc`, then takes the result modulo `MOD`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `_acc` is defined as \((k \times (\_max \% 10)) \% 10\).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `MOD` is 10.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `k` is an integer from user input.
- `a` is a list of integers from user input.
- `_sum` is the maximum value of `_sum + a[i]` for all \(i\) in the range of \(n\).
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations of the loop.
- `i` is `k`, and `i` must be less than `k`.

The code prints \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% \text{MOD}\). This means:

1. It calculates the sum of the list `a`.
2. It adds `_acc` to this sum.
3. It takes the result modulo 10.

Since `_acc` is not affected by the print statement, its value remains the same. All other variables are also not directly modified by the print statement. The only change is the output printed by the code.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **the value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\)**.
