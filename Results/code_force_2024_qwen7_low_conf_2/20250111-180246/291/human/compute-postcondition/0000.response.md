`s` is assigned the value `str(n)`, which converts the integer `n` to a string. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of test cases; `s` is a string representation of `n`; each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9)**
