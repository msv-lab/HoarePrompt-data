Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a string `s` representing a number composed of digits. The function iterates over each digit in `s` and checks if the integer value of the digit at the current position is less than 5. If such a digit is found, the function records the index of this digit and breaks out of the loop. If no digit less than 5 is found, the function sets the result to -1. Finally, the function returns the recorded index or -1 if no such index exists. This process is repeated for each test case, but the function itself only processes one test case as specified by the input `n`. The function does not perform any operations on arrays or modify their sums; it only examines the digits of a single string representation of a number.**
