According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`
- `_max` is the maximum of its current value and `_sum`
- `_a` is a non-empty list of integers
- `n` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1, so it becomes `i + 1`. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, the state should be adjusted as follows:
- `_sum` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `_max` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `_a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration
- `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
2. `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

State: **`_sum` is max(0, _sum + a[i]), `_max` is the maximum of its current value and `_sum`, `_a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
