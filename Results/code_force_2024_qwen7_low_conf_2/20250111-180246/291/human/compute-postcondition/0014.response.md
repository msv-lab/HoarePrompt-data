Postcondition: **`total` is -1, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, and `res` is 1. If the integer at position `i` in `s` is less than 5, then `res` remains 1 and no further changes occur. If the integer at position `i` in `s` is not less than 5, then `res` remains 1 and no further changes occur.**
