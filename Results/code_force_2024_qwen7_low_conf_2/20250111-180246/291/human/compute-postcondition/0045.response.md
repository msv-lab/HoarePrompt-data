According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `_sum` is the maximum value of `max(0, _sum + a[i])` over all iterations, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations, `_a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least `k` elements, `_acc` is `((_max % MOD) + _max) % MOD`, `i` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be 2. The value of `_sum` and `_max` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `_acc` will also remain unchanged.

State: **_sum is the maximum value of `max(0, _sum + a[i])` over all iterations, _max is the maximum value of _sum over all iterations, _a is a non-empty list of integers with at least k elements, _acc is ((_max % MOD) + _max) % MOD, i is 2, and k is a positive integer.**
