The code updates `_sum` to be the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers and `i` is an index within the range of the list, `_sum` is updated based on the value of `a[i]`.

The initial state is:
- `_sum` is `max(0, _sum + a[i+1])`
- `_max` is at least 0 and potentially higher
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers
- `n` must be greater than 0

After the code execution, `_sum` will be updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`. The value of `_max` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. The values of `a` and `n` also remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`
- `_max` is at least 0 and potentially higher
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers
- `n` must be greater than 0

Output State: **_sum is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`, `_max` is at least 0 and potentially higher, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
