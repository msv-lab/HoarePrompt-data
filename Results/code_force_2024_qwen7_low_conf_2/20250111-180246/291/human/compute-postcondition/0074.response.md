The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process a set of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, along with an array `a` of length `n`. The parameters are described as follows:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers where \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for each element `a_i`.

Based on the output descriptions given, the function returns different values depending on the conditions met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts `t`, `n`, `k`, and an array `a`, and returns a specific output based on certain conditions.
