The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is -1, `s` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `res` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
