The code assigns 0 to the variable `_max`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `_sum` remains 0, the value of \((\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10\) is no longer the same, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer. The Output State is:

Output State: **_sum is 0, the value of (\text{sum}(a) + _acc) \% 10 is no longer the same, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_max` is 0**.
