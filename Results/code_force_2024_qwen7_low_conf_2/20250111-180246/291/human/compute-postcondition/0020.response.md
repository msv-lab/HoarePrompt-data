The code updates `_acc` by adding the value of `_acc + _max` modulo `MOD`. Given that `_acc` is `_max % MOD` and `MOD` is 10, let's calculate the new value of `_acc`.

1. The initial value of `_acc` is `_max % 10`.
2. The value of `_acc + _max` is taken modulo 10, and this result is added to `_acc`.

Since `_max` is an integer, let's denote `_max % 10` as `_acc_initial`. Thus, `_acc` becomes:

\[ _acc = (_acc_initial + (_acc_initial + _max)) \% 10 \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ _acc = (2 \cdot _acc_initial + _max) \% 10 \]

Therefore, the new value of `_acc` is `(2 * (_max % 10) + _max) % 10`.

The values of the other variables (`t`, `MOD`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `_sum`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **_acc is (2 * (_max % 10) + _max) % 10, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, MOD is 10, n is at least 1, k is an integer from user input, a is a list of integers from user input, _sum is the maximum value of _sum + a[i] for all i in the range of n, _max is the maximum value of _sum over all iterations of the loop, i is 1, i must be less than k**
