The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2⋅10^5), where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of operations. The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the array itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The output should be the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, and for each test case within `n`, it performs `k` operations on an array of length `n` to maximize the sum of the array, returning the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
