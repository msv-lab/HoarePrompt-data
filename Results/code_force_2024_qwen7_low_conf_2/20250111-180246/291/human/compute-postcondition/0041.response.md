To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and analyze the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `_sum` is the maximum value of `max(0, _sum + a[i])` over all iterations.
- `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations.
- `_a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `_acc` is 0 (though this variable is not directly relevant to the loop condition).

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < k`.
2. **Variables Involved**: The loop involves the variable `i`, and potentially the variables `_sum` and `_a` as they are updated within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and runs until `i < k`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 and should satisfy `i < k` at the start.
2. **List `_a`**: Although `_sum` and `_a` are involved in the loop, the primary concern is that the loop must be able to iterate `k` times, meaning `_a` must have at least `k` elements to support the loop's iterations.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:

- `i` must be 0.
- `k` must be a positive integer such that the loop can run `k` times without exceeding its limit.

Given these points, the required state adjustment is:

**State: **`_sum` is the maximum value of `max(0, _sum + a[i])` over all iterations, `_max` is the maximum value of `_sum` over all iterations, `_a` is a non-empty list of integers with at least `k` elements, `_acc` is 0, `i` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer.**
