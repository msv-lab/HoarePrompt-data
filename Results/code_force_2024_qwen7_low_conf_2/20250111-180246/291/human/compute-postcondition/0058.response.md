 `_sum` is updated to the maximum of 0 and `_sum + a[i]`. The value of `_max` remains unchanged because it was not affected by this line of code. `_a` remains unchanged, as does `_acc`, `i`, `num_iterations`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the only affected variable is `_sum`.

Given the initial state:
- `_sum` is `max(0, a[k])`
- `_max` is `_sum`
- `_a` is a list of integers
- `_acc` is `k * (0 % MOD)`
- `i` is `k + 1`
- `num_iterations` is `num_iterations - 2`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and `k < n`

After executing the code `_sum = max(0, _sum + a[i])`, `_sum` is updated to `max(0, _sum + a[i])`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, `a[i]` refers to `a[k+1]`.

Output State: **_sum is max(0, _sum + a[k+1]), _max is max(0, a[k]), _a is a list of integers, _acc is k * (0 % MOD), i is k + 2, num_iterations is num_iterations - 2, n is an input integer, k is an input integer and k < n**
