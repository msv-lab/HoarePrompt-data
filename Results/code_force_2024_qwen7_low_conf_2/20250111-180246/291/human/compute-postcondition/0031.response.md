The code updates `_sum` by taking the maximum of 0 and the sum of `_sum` and `a[i]`, where `i` is the current index in the list `a`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers, let's consider the general case where `a[i]` can be any integer.

- If `a[i]` is positive or zero, `_sum` will be updated to `_sum + a[i]`.
- If `a[i]` is negative, `_sum` will remain unchanged because `max(0, _sum + a[i])` will be 0.

The other variables (`_max`, `a`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can only express `_sum` in terms of its previous value and the current element of the list `a`.

Output State: **`_sum` is max(0, `_sum` + `a[i]`), `_max` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `n` must be greater than 0**
