### Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by finding the maximum sum of the array after performing a series of operations. However, the logic in the main part of the program is incorrect. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after \( k \) operations. Instead, it calculates a different value, which does not match the problem requirements.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Sum**: The program uses a while loop to try to find the maximum subarray sum by removing elements from both ends of the array. This approach is not appropriate for solving the problem as described. The problem requires adding the sum of any contiguous subarray multiple times, not removing elements.

2. **Incorrect Final Calculation**: The final calculation `print((sum(arr) + mx * (2 ** k - 1)) % (10 ** 9 + 7))` is also incorrect. The variable `mx` is calculated incorrectly, and the final formula does not account for the correct way to maximize the sum after \( k \) operations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function `func_1` is irrelevant to the main problem and is not used in the provided program. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the main program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirements and does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
