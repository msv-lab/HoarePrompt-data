Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to calculate the maximum sum after performing k operations but fails to do so accurately. Specifically, the program tries to split the array into two parts and calculate the maximum subarray sum in the left part, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

The correct approach would involve understanding that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the total sum of the array (bsum) multiplied by \(2^k - 1\) to the maximum subarray sum found. However, the current implementation calculates a subarray sum in an incorrect manner and does not account for the full range of possible operations.

Here's a more accurate way to solve the problem:

```python
t = int(input())
MOD = 10**9 + 7

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the total sum of the array
    bsum = sum(arr)
    
    # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
    max_subarray_sum = max_subarray = 0
    for num in arr:
        max_subarray = max(num, max_subarray + num)
        max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, max_subarray)
    
    # Calculate the result
    result = (max_subarray_sum + bsum * (2**k - 1)) % MOD
    print(result)
```

This approach correctly identifies the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm and then adds the total sum of the array multiplied by \(2^k - 1\) to get the final result, which matches the problem description.
