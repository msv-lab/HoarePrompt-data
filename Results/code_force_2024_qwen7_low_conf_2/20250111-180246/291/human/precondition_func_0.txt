n is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5), where n is the length of the array and k is the number of operations. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9) representing the array itself. It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The output should be the maximum sum of the array after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7.
