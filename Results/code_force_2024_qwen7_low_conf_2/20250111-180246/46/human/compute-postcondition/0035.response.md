The code `b += 1` increments the value of `b` by 1. Since `b` was initially 0, after executing this line, `b` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, and `ab[i]` is not equal to 'A'.**
