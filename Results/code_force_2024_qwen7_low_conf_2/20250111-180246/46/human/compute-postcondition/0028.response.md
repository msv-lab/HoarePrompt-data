The code `n = len(ab)` calculates the length of the list `ab` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of the list `ab` is stored in `n`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\); `ab` is a list of characters based on user input; `n` is the length of the list `ab`; `a` is the count of 'A' in the list `ab`; `b` is the count of 'B' in the list `ab`.**
