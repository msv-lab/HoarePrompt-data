The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on inputs that are implied to be provided within the scope of the function call, such as a test case where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\) and an input string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function returns based on the conditions specified in the output.
