`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`. After executing the line of code, `t` will take the integer value entered by the user, but it must still satisfy the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`, and `t` is the integer value entered by the user.**
