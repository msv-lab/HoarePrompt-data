State before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`, and `t` is the integer value entered by the user.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 32 (inclusive).

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `t` meets these criteria. Since `t` is the integer value entered by the user, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`**
