The value of `a` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `a` is not specified in the initial state. The length of the list `ab` (`n`) and the value of `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is increased by 1**
