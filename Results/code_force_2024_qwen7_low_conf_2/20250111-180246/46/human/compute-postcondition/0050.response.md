Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab`, `a` is the total number of occurrences of 'A' in `ab`, and `b` is the total number of occurrences of any character other than 'A' in `ab`. If `a > b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed to the console.***
