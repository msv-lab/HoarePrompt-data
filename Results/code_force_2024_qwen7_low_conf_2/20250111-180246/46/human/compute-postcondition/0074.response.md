The code `print('B')` prints the string 'B' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The only change is the output of the string 'B'.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in the list `ab`, `b` is the count of non-'A' characters in the list `ab`, `n` is the length of the list `ab`, and the string 'B' is printed to the console.**
