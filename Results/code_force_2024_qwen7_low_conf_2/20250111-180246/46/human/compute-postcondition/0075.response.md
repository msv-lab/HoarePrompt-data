Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `a` is the count of 'A' characters in the list `ab`, `b` is the count of non-'A' characters in the list `ab`, and `n` is the length of the list `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed.***
