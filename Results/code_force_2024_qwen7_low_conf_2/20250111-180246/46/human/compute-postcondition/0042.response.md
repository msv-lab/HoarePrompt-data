The code `a += 1` increments the value of `a` by 1. Given the initial state, `a` was initially 1. Therefore, after the execution of this line of code, `a` will be 2.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `ab`, `i`, `n`, `b`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `i` is \(k + 1\), `n` is greater than \(k + 1\), `a` is 2, and `b` is determined based on the condition given.**
