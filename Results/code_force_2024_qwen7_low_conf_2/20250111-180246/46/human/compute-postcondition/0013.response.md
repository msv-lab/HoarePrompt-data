The value of `a` is incremented by 1. Initially, `a` is 1, so after executing `a += 1`, the value of `a` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab` and must be greater than 0, `a` is 2, `b` is 0, `i` is 1**
