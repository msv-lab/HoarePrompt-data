`b` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `i` is \(k + 1\), `n` is greater than \(k + 1\), `a` is 1, `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1.**
