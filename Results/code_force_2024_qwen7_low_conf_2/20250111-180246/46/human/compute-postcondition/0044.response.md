Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `i` is \(k + 1\), `n` is greater than \(k + 1\). If `ab[i] == 'A'`, then `a` is 2, and `b` is determined based on the condition given. Otherwise, `a` remains 1, and `b` is the previous value of `b` plus 1.***
