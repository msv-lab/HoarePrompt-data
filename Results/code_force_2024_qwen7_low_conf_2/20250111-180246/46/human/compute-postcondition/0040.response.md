Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 31\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is 1, and `b` is determined as follows: if `ab[1] == 'A'`, then `b` is 1; if `ab[1] != 'A'`, then `b` is 2 if it was initially 1, or 1 if it was initially 0.**
