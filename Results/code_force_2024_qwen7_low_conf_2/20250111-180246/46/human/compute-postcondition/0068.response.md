`b` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is \(n-1\) and `n` must be greater than 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged within the specified range, and `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, which is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `i` is \(n-1\), `n` must be greater than 1, and `b` is increased by 1.
