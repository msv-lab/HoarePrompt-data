The value of `b` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `b` is 0, so it will become 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab` and must be greater than 0, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `i` is 1.
