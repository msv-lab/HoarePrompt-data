Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab`, `a` is the count of 'A' in the list `ab`, `b` is the count of 'B' in the list `ab`. If the count of 'A' (`a`) is greater than the count of 'B' (`b`), the program prints 'A'. Otherwise, the program does not print anything.**
