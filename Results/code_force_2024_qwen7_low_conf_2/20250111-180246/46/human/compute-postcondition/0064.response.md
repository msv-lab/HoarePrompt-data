`b` is incremented by 1. The values of `t` and `ab` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `b` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `b` is increased by 1**
