Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'.
3. It initializes two counters `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
4. It iterates through the string, incrementing the appropriate counter based on the character encountered.
5. After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the more frequent character.
6. The program handles all test cases as specified, ensuring distinct strings for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the provided program, it correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
