Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 32.
- For each test case, the program reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'.
- The program then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string.
- Based on the comparison of these counts, the program correctly outputs the character ('A' or 'B') that appears most frequently.
- The program handles all provided examples correctly and follows the logic as described in the problem statement.
- There are no logical errors or missing functionalities in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
