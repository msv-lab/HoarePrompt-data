You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab`, `a` is the total number of occurrences of 'A' in `ab`, `b` is the total number of occurrences of any character other than 'A' in `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 32\)) and processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an input string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and any other character (which is 'B'). If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the console for each test case. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `t` and valid inputs for the test cases. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
