You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        n = len(ab)
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab`, `a` is the total number of occurrences of 'A' in `ab`, `b` is the total number of occurrences of any character other than 'A' in `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed to the console.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'.
3. It initializes two counters `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
4. It iterates through the string, incrementing the appropriate counter based on the character encountered.
5. After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the more frequent character.
6. The program handles all test cases as specified, ensuring distinct strings for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the provided program, it correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
