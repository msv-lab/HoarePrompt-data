You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        n = len(ab)
        a = 0
        b = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 32\)) and processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an input string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and any other character (which is 'B'). If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the console for each test case. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `t` and valid inputs for the test cases. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'.
3. It initializes two counters `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
4. It iterates through the string, incrementing the appropriate counter based on the character encountered.
5. After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the more frequent character.
6. The program handles all test cases as specified, ensuring distinct strings for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the provided program, it correctly determines which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
