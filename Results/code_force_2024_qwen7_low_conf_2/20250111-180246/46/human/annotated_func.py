#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        ab = [x for x in input()]
        
        n = len(ab)
        
        a = 0
        
        b = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ab[i] == 'A':
                a += 1
            else:
                b += 1
        
        if a > b:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 32\), `ab` is a list of characters based on user input, `n` is the length of the list `ab`, `a` is the total number of occurrences of 'A' in `ab`, `b` is the total number of occurrences of any character other than 'A' in `ab`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the string 'A' is printed to the console. Otherwise, the string 'B' is printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 32\)) and processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an input string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of 'A' and any other character (which is 'B'). If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result to the console for each test case. Potential edge cases include the minimum and maximum values of `t` and valid inputs for the test cases. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
