### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires generating a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Initial Assessment Analysis**:
   - The initial assessment claims that the constructed permutation \( a = [1, n/2 + 1, 2, n/2 + 2, \ldots, n/2, n] \) (if \( n \) is even) or \( a = [1, n/2 + 1, 2, n/2 + 2, \ldots, (n-1)/2, n/2 + (n-1)/2, n] \) (if \( n \) is odd) satisfies the condition.
   - The reasoning provided is that since the second half of the sequence starts from \( n/2 + 1 \), any element in the second half cannot divide any element in the first half due to their relative sizes.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the permutation \( a = [1, n/2 + 1, 2, n/2 + 2, \ldots, n/2, n] \) for even \( n \).
   - For odd \( n \), the permutation is \( a = [1, n/2 + 1, 2, n/2 + 2, \ldots, (n-1)/2, n/2 + (n-1)/2, n] \).

   - **Even \( n \)**:
     - Elements in the first half: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, n/2 \).
     - Elements in the second half: \( n/2 + 1, n/2 + 2, \ldots, n \).
     - Any element in the second half is greater than any element in the first half, so they cannot divide each other.
     - Within the first half, the pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) are consecutive, and no element in the first half can divide another due to their relative sizes.
   
   - **Odd \( n \)**:
     - Elements in the first half: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, (n-1)/2 \).
     - Elements in the second half: \( (n-1)/2 + 1, (n-1)/2 + 2, \ldots, n/2 + (n-1)/2 \).
     - The middle element \( n \) is appended at the end.
     - Similar to the even case, elements in the first half and second half cannot divide each other due to their relative sizes.
     - Within the first half, the pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) are consecutive, and no element in the first half can divide another due to their relative sizes.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The constructed permutation indeed ensures that no pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exists where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
