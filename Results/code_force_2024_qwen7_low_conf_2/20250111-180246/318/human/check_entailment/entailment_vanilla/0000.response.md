### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two pairs \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - The provided solution constructs a permutation by interleaving two sequences: the first half of numbers from 1 to \( n/2 \) and the second half shifted by \( n/2 \).

2. **Checking the Solution**:
   - Let's verify if the constructed permutation satisfies the given condition.
   - Consider the generated permutation \( a = [1, n/2 + 1, 2, n/2 + 2, \ldots, n/2, n] \).

3. **Analysis**:
   - Suppose \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \). This means:
     - \( p_i = k \cdot p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} = m \cdot p_{j+1} \) for some integers \( k \) and \( m \).
   - For our construction, let's check the pairs:
     - \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) are consecutive elements in the sequence.
     - If \( i \) is in the first half, \( i+1 \) will be in the second half (or vice versa).
     - Since the second half starts from \( n/2 + 1 \), any element in the second half cannot divide any element in the first half because the elements in the second half are all greater than the elements in the first half.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that no pair \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \) exists where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the problem's conditions.
