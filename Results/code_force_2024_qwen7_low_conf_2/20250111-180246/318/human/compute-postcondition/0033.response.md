Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `a` is a list containing `[i, mid + i]`.

### For Loop Details
- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.

### End of Previous Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the value it had before the last increment (which means it was `i - 1` before the last iteration).
- Therefore, if the loop just finished an iteration, `i` would have been incremented from `i - 1` to `i`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2 + 1`.
- Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, for the next iteration to happen, `i` should be exactly `n // 2`.

### Adjusted States
- Since `i` was incremented from `i - 1` to `i` in the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
- Thus, `i` must be `n // 2` at the start of the next iteration.

### Final State
- `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, which is `[i, mid + i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`a` is a list containing `[i, mid + i]`, `i` is `n // 2`**
