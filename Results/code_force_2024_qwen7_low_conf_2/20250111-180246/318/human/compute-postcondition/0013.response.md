The list `a` is appended with the value `mid + i`. Given that `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is an unspecified variable in the list, the new element added to `a` is `n // 2 + i`.

Since the initial state of `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1, n // 2, i]`, after appending `n // 2 + i` to the list, the updated list `a` becomes `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1, n // 2, i, n // 2 + i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1, n // 2, i, n // 2 + i]`**
