The code prints the element at index `i` from the list `a`. However, the variable `i` is not defined in the given initial state or within the provided code snippet. Therefore, the code will raise a NameError because `i` is not defined. Since the code does not change any variables and only causes an error, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `a` is a list**
