The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. Initially, `a` is defined as `[i, n // 2 + i]`. However, since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, we can assume `i` to be a specific value, let's say `i = 1` for calculation purposes. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is at least 2
- `mid` is `n // 2`
- `a` is a list containing two elements `[i, n // 2 + i]`

After the code `a.append(i)` is executed, `i` (which is 1) is appended to the list `a`.

So, the updated list `a` will be `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is at least 2; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1]`**
