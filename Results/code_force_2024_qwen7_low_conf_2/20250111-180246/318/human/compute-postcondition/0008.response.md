Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is at least 1 (`t >= 1`)
- `n` is at least 2 (`n >= 2`)
- `mid` is `n // 2` (this means `mid` is the integer division of `n` by 2)
- `a` is a list containing two elements `[i, n // 2 + i]`

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `n // 2 + 1` (inclusive).

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- The loop has just completed an iteration where `i` was `n // 2`.
- This means `i` is now `n // 2 + 1`.

### Next Iteration Requirements:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range specified in the loop, which is from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`. 

Since `i` is currently `n // 2 + 1`, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already at its upper limit.

### Updated State:
- Since the loop does not execute again, the values of `t`, `n`, `mid`, and `a` remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing two elements `[i, n // 2 + i]`**

This is the final state since the loop does not execute further based on the current values.
