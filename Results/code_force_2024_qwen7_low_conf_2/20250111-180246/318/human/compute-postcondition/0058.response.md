According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2 + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, it needs to be incremented to 3 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 3. 

The value of `n` remains unchanged, but we need to ensure that `n` still meets the requirement of being at least 2.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 2]`, `mid` is `n // 2`**
