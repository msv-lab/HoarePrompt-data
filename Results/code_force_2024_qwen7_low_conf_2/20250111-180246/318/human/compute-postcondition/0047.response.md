According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1.
- `i` is `k + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `i` must be less than `n`.
2. After incrementing `i` by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by default), `i` should become `k + 2`.

Given that `i` was `k + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue:
- `k + 2` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be `k + 2`.
- For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than `k + 2`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `i` is k + 2, `n` must be greater than k + 2**
