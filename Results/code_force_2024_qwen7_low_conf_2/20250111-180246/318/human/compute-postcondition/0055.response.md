Let's break down the given for loop and identify which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

The for loop is:
```python
for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is set to `n + 1`.

3. **Value of `n`**: `n` is an input integer.

4. **Range of Values for `i`**: For the loop to execute, `i` must take values from 1 up to `n // 2 + 1`.

Given these points, let's determine the necessary adjustments:

- **Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` as `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be able to start from 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `1`.

- **Value of `n`**: Since `i` must go up to `n // 2 + 1`, `n` must be at least 2 (so that `n // 2 + 1` is a positive number).

Thus, we need to adjust the state such that `i` starts from 1 and `n` is at least 2.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is an empty list, `mid` is `n // 2`**

This ensures that the loop condition `1 <= i < n // 2 + 1` can be satisfied, allowing the loop to execute.
