The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it seems to handle multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `n`. The parameter `t` represents the number of test cases, and `n` is an integer for each test case. The function does not return anything directly but rather processes the test cases.

Given the constraints, the function accepts an integer `t` which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each of these `t` test cases, it processes an integer `n` such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes an integer `n`.**
