According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, but we don't know the exact value of `n`. The variable `i` will be increased by 1 at the start of each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

To determine the new state, we need to consider the following:
- `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration since it is the upper limit of the range.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Let's assume that at the end of the last iteration, `i` was equal to `k` (where `k < n`). For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `n` remains a non-negative integer and at least 1.
- `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since we do not have the exact value of `n` or `i` from the previous iteration, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`, then the new state would be:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `i` is k + 1**.
