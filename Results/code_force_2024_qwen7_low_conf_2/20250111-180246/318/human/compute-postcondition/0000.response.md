`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) remains valid. However, since the code only reads input for `t` and does not provide any further context or input for `n`, the value of `n` remains unspecified according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**
