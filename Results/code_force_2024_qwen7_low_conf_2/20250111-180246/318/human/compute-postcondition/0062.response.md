The code `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. However, the initial state does not specify what `a` and `i` are. For the sake of this example, let's assume that `a` is an empty list and `i` is an integer.

Given this assumption, the impact of the code is that the list `a` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`a` is `[i]`, `i` is an integer**
