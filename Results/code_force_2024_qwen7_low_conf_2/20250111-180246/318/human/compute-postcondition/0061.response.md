Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `a` is [1, 3, 3, n // 2 + 3].
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `i` starting from 1 up to `n // 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, which means `i` is currently at its upper limit.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, and the loop increments `i` within the range, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `n // 2 + 1` (the upper limit of the range).
   - Therefore, we do not need to change the value of `i`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the condition `n // 2 + 1 <= n` holds true, which it does if `n >= 2` (as given).

5. **Updated State:**
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `i` remains 3 since the loop won't execute again.
   - `a` and `mid` remain unchanged as no changes were made in the loop body.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 3, n // 2 + 3], `mid` is `n // 2`**
