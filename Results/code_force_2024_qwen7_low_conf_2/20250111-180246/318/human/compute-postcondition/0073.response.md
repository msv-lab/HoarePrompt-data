The code `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the element at index `i` in the list `a` without a newline. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive even integer.
- `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).
- `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values.
- `mid` is \(\frac{n}{2}\).

Let's calculate the value of `i` and determine what `a[i]` is:

1. Since `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), and `n` is a positive even integer, `i` is an integer.
2. `a` contains pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values. This means `a` looks something like this: `[(1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (\frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n}{2} + 1)]`.
3. The index `i` points to the position in the list `a`. So, the element at index \(i = \frac{n}{2} + 2\) would be the pair \((\frac{n}{2} + 2, \frac{n}{2} + 2)\) because the list starts from 1.

Thus, `a[i]` is the tuple \((\frac{n}{2} + 2, \frac{n}{2} + 2)\). The `print` function will print the first element of this tuple, which is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).

The output of the `print` function is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2\), `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values, `mid` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), and the output is \(\frac{n}{2} + 2**.
