`a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given that `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is 2, the value to be appended is `n // 2 + 2`. Since `n` must be at least 2, the minimum value of `n // 2` is 1 (when `n` is 2), and thus the value appended to `a` is at least 3. The initial state of `a` is `[1]`, so after appending `n // 2 + 2`, `a` becomes `[1, n // 2 + 2]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 2]`, `mid` is `n // 2`**
