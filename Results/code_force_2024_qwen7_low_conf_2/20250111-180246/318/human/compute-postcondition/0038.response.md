The initial state is `a` is `[i, mid + i, i, mid + i, i]`, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`. The code snippet appends `mid + i` to the list `a`.

1. Calculate the value of `i`: Since `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `i` is a specific value depending on `n`.
2. Append `mid + i` to `a`. The new value of `a` will be the original list plus the new element.

Let's denote the specific value of `i` as `k` (where `k = n // 2 + 1`). So, the initial list `a` can be written as `[k, mid + k, k, mid + k, k]`.

After appending `mid + k` to `a`, the updated list `a` becomes `[k, mid + k, k, mid + k, k, mid + k]`.

Output State: **`a` is `[k, mid + k, k, mid + k, k, mid + k]`, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`**
