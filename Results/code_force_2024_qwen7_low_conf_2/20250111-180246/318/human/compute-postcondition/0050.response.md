The code `print('\n', end='')` prints a newline character without moving to the next line, and it does not affect any variable values. Therefore, the only change is the print statement itself, which adds a newline to the output.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing elements printed in order from index 0 to index `n-1`, the output includes a newline character.**
