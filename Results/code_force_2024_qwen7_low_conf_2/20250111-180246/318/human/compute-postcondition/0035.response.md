The list `a` initially contains the elements `[i, mid + i, i]` where `i` is `n // 2`. The code snippet appends `mid + i` to the list `a`. Since `i` is already defined, `mid + i` will be added to the list.

Let's calculate the updated list:

- Initial list `a`: `[i, mid + i, i]`
- After appending `mid + i`: `[i, mid + i, i, mid + i]`

So, the updated state of the variables is:
- `a` is now `[i, mid + i, i, mid + i]`
- `i` remains `n // 2`
- `mid` remains unchanged

Output State: **`a` is `[i, mid + i, i, mid + i]`, `i` is `n // 2`**
