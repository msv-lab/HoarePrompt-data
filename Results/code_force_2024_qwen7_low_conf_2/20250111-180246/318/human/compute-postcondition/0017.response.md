Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing `n // 2` pairs of integers where each pair consists of an integer `i` and its corresponding `mid + i` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, the integer `n` is added as a standalone element to the list `a`.***
