Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is a list containing `[1, mid+1, 2, mid+2, ..., n//2, mid+n//2]` if `n` is even, otherwise `a` is a list containing `[1, mid+1, 2, mid+2, ..., (n-1)//2, mid+(n-1)//2, n]`, and all elements in `a` are printed in sequence without newlines.**
