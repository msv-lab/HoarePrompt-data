The code `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive even integer.
- `i` is `n // 2 + 1`.
- `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.

Let's calculate the value of `i` first:
\[ i = \frac{n}{2} + 1 \]

Since `a` contains pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values, the structure of `a` would look something like this:
\[ a = [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), \ldots, (\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2}), (\frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n}{2} + 1)] \]

So, the element at index `i - 1` (since list indices start at 0) in `a` is:
\[ a[i - 1] = (\frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n}{2} + 1) \]

Thus, `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print:
\[ \frac{n}{2} + 1 \]

After executing the code, the variable `a` and `mid` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values, `mid` is \(\frac{n}{2}\), and \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) is printed.**
