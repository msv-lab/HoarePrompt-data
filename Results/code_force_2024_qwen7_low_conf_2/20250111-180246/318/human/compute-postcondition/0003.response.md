The code `mid = n // 2` assigns the integer division of `n` by 2 to the variable `mid`. The value of `t` is not affected, and `n` remains unchanged. The output state is: `t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer input from the user; `mid` is assigned the value of `n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1; `n` is an integer input from the user; `mid` is assigned the value of `n // 2`**
