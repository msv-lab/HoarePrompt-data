The list `a` initially contains `[i]`. The code snippet appends `mid + i` to the list `a`. Since the initial value of `i` is an integer and `mid` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume `mid` is also an integer (as it must be for the addition to work).

The code appends `mid + i` to `a`, changing the contents of `a` from `[i]` to `[i, mid + i]`.

Output State: **`a` is `[i, mid + i]`, `i` is an integer**
