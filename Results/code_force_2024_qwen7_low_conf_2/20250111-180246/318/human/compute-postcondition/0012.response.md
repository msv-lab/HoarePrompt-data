The code snippet `a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Since `i` is not defined before this line of code, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the list `a` will be updated with the value of `i` appended to it.

Given the initial state where `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1, n // 2]`, the updated list `a` will include the new value `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1, n // 2, i]`**
