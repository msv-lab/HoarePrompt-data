The code snippet appends `mid + i` to the list `a`. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `n` is at least 2.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1]`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The code `a.append(mid + i)` appends the value `mid + i` to the list `a`.
   - Here, `i` starts from 0 in a typical list append operation (assuming a simple increment without a specific range defined).

3. **Calculating the Value to Append:**
   - Since `mid` is `n // 2`, let's denote this as `k = n // 2`.
   - For `i = 0`, `mid + i` is `k + 0 = k`.
   - So, the first value to append is `k`.
   - The next iteration (if there was one) would be for `i = 1`, so `mid + i` is `k + 1`.

4. **Updated List `a`:**
   - Initially, `a = [1, k + 1, 1]`.
   - After appending `k` (which is `n // 2`), the list becomes `a = [1, k + 1, 1, k]`.

5. **Final Values:**
   - `t` remains at least 1.
   - `n` remains at least 2.
   - `mid` remains `n // 2`.
   - `a` is now `[1, k + 1, 1, k]`, where `k = n // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1; `n` is at least 2; `mid` is `n // 2`; `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 1, 1, n // 2]`**
