The code `print(a[i], end=' ')` attempts to print the value of `a[i]`. However, there is no definition or assignment to the variable `a` in the provided code snippet. Additionally, the variable `k` is not defined in the initial state or within the code snippet. The variable `i` is mentioned as being `k + 1`, but since `k` is undefined, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Since the variable `a` is not defined, we cannot provide a specific value for `a[i]`. The only changes are related to the printing action, which does not affect the variables themselves.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and at least 1, `i` is k + 1**
