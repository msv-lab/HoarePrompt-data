The initial state is as follows:
- `a` is a list containing `n // 2` pairs of the form `[i, mid + i]` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n // 2`.
- `i` is now `n // 2 + 1`.
- `mid` is `n // 2`.
- The length of `a` is odd since `n % 2 != 0`.

The code snippet is:
```python
a.append(n)
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. `a.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `a`.
2. Since `a` initially contains `n // 2` pairs and its length is odd, appending `n` will increase the length of `a` by 1, making it `n // 2 + 1`.
3. The value of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `a` now contains `n // 2` pairs plus the additional element `n`.
- `i` is still `n // 2 + 1`.
- `mid` is still `n // 2`.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing `n // 2` pairs of the form `[i, mid + i]` plus the additional element `n`, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `mid` is `n // 2`.**
