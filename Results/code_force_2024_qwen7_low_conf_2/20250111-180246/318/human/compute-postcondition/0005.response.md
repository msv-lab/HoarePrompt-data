Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):`.
   - This means `i` will take values from 1 to `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:**
   - The loop will execute if there are at least 2 values for `i` (i.e., `i` ranges from 1 to `n // 2`).
   - Therefore, `n // 2` must be at least 1.

3. **Check the given initial states:**
   - `t` must be at least 1 (this is unrelated to the loop conditions and does not affect the loop's execution).
   - `n` is an integer input from the user.
   - `mid` is assigned the value of `n // 2`, so `mid` is already determined based on `n`.
   - `a` is an empty list (this is also unrelated to the loop conditions).

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted:**
   - Since `i` ranges from 1 to `n // 2`, we need `n // 2` to be at least 1.
   - This implies `n` must be at least 2 (since `n // 2 >= 1`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `a` is an empty list**
