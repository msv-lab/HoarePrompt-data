`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `a`. The original value of `a` is `[1, n // 2 + 2]`. Since `n` must be at least 2, `n // 2` is at least 1, making `n // 2 + 2` at least 3. Thus, the initial list `a` is `[1, 3]`.

After appending `i` (which is 3) to `a`, the list `a` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`.

The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` and `mid` remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 3], `mid` is `n // 2`**
