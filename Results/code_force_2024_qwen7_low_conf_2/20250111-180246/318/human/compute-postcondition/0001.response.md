According to the given code snippet, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) the specified number. Therefore, if `t` is 0, the range function will generate no numbers, and the loop will not execute.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, we need to adjust the state to ensure `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, and `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5**
