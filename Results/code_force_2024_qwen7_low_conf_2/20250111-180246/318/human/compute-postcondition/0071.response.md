The code snippet `print(a[i], end=' ')` prints the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Based on the initial state:

- `n` is a positive even integer.
- `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\).
- `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values.
- `mid` is \(\frac{n}{2}\).

Let's break this down:

1. The value of `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\).
2. The list `a` contains pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values. So, `a` looks like this: `[ (1, mid), (2, mid+1), ..., (\frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n}{2} + 1) ]`.
3. We need to find the element at index `i` in `a`. Since `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), we need the \(\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\)-th element in the list `a`.

Given that the list `a` contains pairs, the \(\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\)-th element in the list `a` is \(\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\). Thus, the element at index `i` in `a` is \(\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1, \frac{n}{2} + 1\right)\).

Therefore, the output will print the first element of the pair, which is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive even integer, `i` is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\), `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\) and their corresponding mid-values, `mid` is \(\frac{n}{2}\); the value printed is \(\frac{n}{2} + 1\)**.
