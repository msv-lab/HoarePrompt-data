The code `a = []` initializes an empty list `a`. This means the list `a` which was previously containing elements from index 0 to index `n-1` is now an empty list. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `mid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is an empty list, `mid` is `n // 2`.**
