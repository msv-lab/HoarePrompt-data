`a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`. Given that `mid` is `n // 2` and `i` is 3, the value appended to `a` will be `n // 2 + 3`. Since `n` must be at least 2, the smallest possible value for `n // 2` is 1 (when `n` is 2), making the smallest possible value for `a[-1]` 4. However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified, `a[-1]` remains as `n // 2 + 3`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `a` is [1, 3, 3, n // 2 + 3], `mid` is `n // 2`**
