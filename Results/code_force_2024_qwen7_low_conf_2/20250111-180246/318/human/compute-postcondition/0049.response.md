Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list containing elements printed in order from index 0 to index `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and List Structure**:
   - If `n` is odd, `a` contains `n // 2` pairs of the form `[i, mid + i]` plus an additional element `n`, where `i` ranges from `1` to `n // 2` and `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - If `n` is even, `a` contains `n // 2` pairs of the form `[i, mid + i]` where `i` ranges from `1` to `n // 2` and `mid` is `n // 2`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - For each iteration, it prints the element at index `i` of the list `a`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes (when `i` reaches `n-1`), all elements of `a` from index `0` to index `n-1` will have been printed exactly once.
   - Therefore, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `a` will retain its original structure but the loop would have iterated through all its elements.

4. **No Iteration Case**:
   - If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all, and both `i` and `a` will retain their initial values (which is consistent with the loop's behavior).

Thus, the final output state after the loop completes is that `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `n`, and `a` is a list containing the elements it originally had.
