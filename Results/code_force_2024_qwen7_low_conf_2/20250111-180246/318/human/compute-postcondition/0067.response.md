Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is either `n + 1` or `n // 2 + 1`, `a` is either `[n]` or a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values, and `mid` is `n // 2`. If `n` is odd, `i` is `n + 1` and `a` is `[n]`. If `n` is even, `i` is `n // 2 + 1` and `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values.***
