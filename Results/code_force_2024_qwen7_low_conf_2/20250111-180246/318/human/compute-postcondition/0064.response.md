Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided information and the loop code:

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`. For each iteration:
- `a.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `a`.
- `a.append(mid + i)` appends the value of `mid + i` to the list `a`.

### Iteration Breakdown
- **First Iteration (i = 1):**
  - `a` becomes `[1, mid + 1]`
  - `i` becomes 2
  - `a` after this iteration: `[1, mid + 1]`
  
- **Second Iteration (i = 2):**
  - `a` becomes `[1, mid + 1, 2, mid + 2]`
  - `i` becomes 3
  - `a` after this iteration: `[1, mid + 1, 2, mid + 2]`

- **Third Iteration (i = 3):**
  - `a` becomes `[1, mid + 1, 2, mid + 2, 3, mid + 3]`
  - `i` becomes 4
  - `a` after this iteration: `[1, mid + 1, 2, mid + 2, 3, mid + 3]`

From the pattern, we can generalize that after `k` iterations, `a` will have the following elements:
\[ [1, mid + 1, 2, mid + 2, \ldots, k, mid + k] \]

### Final Iteration Analysis
The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n // 2 + 1`. Therefore, after the loop finishes:
- The value of `i` will be `n // 2 + 1`.
- The value of `a` will be a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values.

### Special Case: When the Loop Does Not Execute
If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Therefore:
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `a` remains an empty list `[]`.
- `mid` remains `n // 2`.

### Output State Calculation
Combining the above analysis, we can write the output state as follows:

**Output State:** 
- If `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values, and `mid` is `n // 2`.
- If `n` is less than 2, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is an empty list `[]`, and `mid` is `n // 2`.

Thus, the final output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `a` is a list containing pairs of numbers from 1 to `n // 2 + 1` and their corresponding mid-values, `mid` is `n // 2`.**
