The function accepts an integer `t`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `n`, ensuring that `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`. It then generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` such that the list is symmetric around the middle value of `n`. If `n` is even, the list contains pairs of numbers symmetrically placed around the middle; if `n` is odd, the middle number `n` is included in the list. After constructing the list, the function prints each element of the list in sequence without newlines, followed by a newline after each test case. The output consists of `t` sets of such lists, each set separated by a newline.
