    return components
    #`The program returns the list containing the results of BFS operations for all unvisited nodes starting from each node i in the range 1 to n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of prison cells, and a list of tuples `edges` representing bidirectional corridors between cells. It constructs an undirected graph using the provided edges and then performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each unvisited node. The function returns a list of the results of these BFS operations, where each result is a list of nodes that are reachable from the respective starting node, forming separate connected components. The function ensures that all nodes from 1 to `n` are processed, and only unvisited nodes trigger a BFS operation. If a node is already visited, it is skipped. The function handles the case where the graph might be disconnected, resulting in multiple connected components being identified and returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing a cell index (1 ≤ start ≤ n), where n is the number of prison cells. The graph is represented as a dictionary where keys are cell indices and values are lists of neighboring cell indices. visited is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, indicating whether each cell has been visited during the BFS traversal.
def bfs(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True
            component.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `queue` is an empty deque, `visited` is a boolean list where all elements are `True`, `component` is a list containing all nodes in the connected component starting from `start` including all nodes visited during the entire execution of the loop.
    return component
    #`The program returns the list 'component' containing all nodes in the connected component starting from 'start' including all nodes visited during the entire execution of the loop`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts a parameter `start`, which is an integer representing a cell index within a range (1 ≤ start ≤ n). It performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the graph, marking each visited cell and collecting all cells within the same connected component as `start`. The function returns a list `component` containing all nodes in the connected component starting from `start`, including all nodes visited during the entire execution of the loop. Potential edge cases include when the `start` cell is isolated (no neighbors), or when the graph is fully connected (all cells are part of one component). The function does not handle cases where `start` is out of bounds or where the `graph` dictionary is empty.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of prison cells, m is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors, c is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i.

The number of connected components in the graph is greater than 1

    for i in range(len(components)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
            cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
            cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is the last index of `components` - 1, `j` is the last index of `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum value of `cost_i + cost_j + c` over all valid iterations of the loop, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[i]`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`.
    return min_cost
    #The program returns min_cost which is the minimum value of cost_i (the square of the length of components[i]) + cost_j (the square of the length of components[j]) + c over all valid iterations of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function first calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of connected components in the graph represented by `n` and `edges`. If the number of connected components is exactly one, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the function iterates over all pairs of connected components, calculates the cost as the sum of the squares of their sizes plus `c`, and keeps track of the minimum cost found. Finally, the function returns the minimum cost.

Potential edge cases:
- If the number of connected components is exactly one, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- If there are multiple connected components, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the given formula and returns it.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are invalid (e.g., non-integer values, negative values for `n` or `c`, or invalid edges). This should be considered in practical applications.
