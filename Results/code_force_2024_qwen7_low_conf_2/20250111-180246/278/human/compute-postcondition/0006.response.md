State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of components**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `i`:**
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   
2. **Range of `j`:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `len(components)`.
   - Given `i` is 0, the loop runs for `j` in the range from `0 + 1` to `len(components)`, which simplifies to `1` to `len(components)`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one element in the `components` list (since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(components)`).

4. **Initial State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` is already 0, no change is needed for `i`.
   - `components` must be greater than 1 to ensure there are elements for `j` to iterate over starting from 1.
   - `j` must be initialized to a value within its valid range (greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `components`), although it will increment within the loop body.

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `components` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 0
- `j` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `components`
