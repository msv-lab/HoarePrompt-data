The code assigns the value of `len(components[j]) ** 2` to `cost_j`. Given that `j` is 3, `cost_j` becomes `len(components[3]) ** 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 0, and the other variables also remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`components` must be greater than 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cost_i` is `len(components[0]), cost_j` is `len(components[3]) ** 2**
