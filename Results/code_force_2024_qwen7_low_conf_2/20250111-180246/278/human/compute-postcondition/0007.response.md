The code calculates the square of the length of the string at index `i` in the list `components` and assigns it to the variable `cost_i`. The value of `i` is 0, so `cost_i` will be the square of the length of the first element in `components`. The lengths of the other elements in `components` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `components`, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the first element in `components`**
