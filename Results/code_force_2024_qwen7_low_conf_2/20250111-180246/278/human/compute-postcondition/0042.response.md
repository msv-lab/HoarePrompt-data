Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is one less than the last index of `components`.
   - `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared.
   - `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared.
   - `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

2. **Loop Definition:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `j = i + 1`.
   - In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1 until `j` reaches the last index of `components`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the last index of `components`.
   - Since `j` is one less than the last index at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1 to reach the last index.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` should be incremented by 1.
   - `cost_j` will now be the length of `components[j]` (which is now the last index) squared.
   - `min_cost` will be updated to include the new `cost_j`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is incremented by 1, making it the last index of `components`.
   - `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` (last index) squared.
   - `min_cost` is updated to `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

**Answer:**
State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is the last index of `components`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`**.
