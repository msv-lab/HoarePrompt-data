Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `components` must be a list with more than one element.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is the last index of `components`.
   - `min_cost` is the minimum cost found during the loop.
   - `cost_i` is the square of the length of the element at index 1 in `components`.
   - `cost_j` is the square of the length of the element at index `j` in `components`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `j = i + 1` to `j = len(components)`.
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be greater than `i`.

3. **Determine Required Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is given as 1, the loop will start if `j > 1`.
   - `j` is initially set to the last index of `components`, which means `j = len(components) - 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `len(components) - 1 > 1` for the loop to start.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `components` must be a list with more than one element (already given).
   - `i` is fixed at 1.
   - `j` must be greater than 1, and since `j` is the last index, `len(components) - 1 > 1`.

Given these points, we can adjust the states required for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `components` must be a list with more than one element.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` must be greater than 1 (which means `len(components) > 2`).

So, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`components` must be a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` must be greater than 1 (which implies `len(components) > 2`).**
