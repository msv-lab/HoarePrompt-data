The code updates the `min_cost` variable by comparing its current value with the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`. Since `min_cost` is initially undefined (or could be considered as infinity in this context), it will be updated to the minimum value between itself and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`.

- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` remains unchanged.
- `cost_i` remains unchanged.
- `cost_j` remains unchanged.

After executing the line `min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)`, `min_cost` is now the minimum value between its original value (considered as infinity) and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is one less than the last index of `components`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`.**
