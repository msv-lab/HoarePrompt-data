`cost_i` is assigned the value of the length of `components[i]` squared. Since `i` is 1, this means `cost_i` is the length of `components[1]` squared. The precondition that `components` is a list with more than one element and `i` is 1 remain valid, and the condition that `j` must be greater than 1 (implying `len(components) > 2`) also remains valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` must be greater than 1 (which implies `len(components) > 2`), and `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`.

Output State: **`components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` must be greater than 1 (which implies `len(components) > 2`), and `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`**.
