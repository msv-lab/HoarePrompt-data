Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function first calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of connected components in the graph represented by `n` and `edges`. If the number of connected components is exactly one, the function returns `-1`. Otherwise, the function iterates over all pairs of connected components, calculates the cost as the sum of the squares of their sizes plus `c`, and keeps track of the minimum cost found. Finally, the function returns the minimum cost.

Potential edge cases:
- If the number of connected components is exactly one, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- If there are multiple connected components, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the given formula and returns it.

Missing functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the input parameters are invalid (e.g., non-integer values, negative values for `n` or `c`, or invalid edges). This should be considered in practical applications.**

After the function concludes, the program state will be as follows:
- The program returns either `-1` if there is exactly one connected component, or the minimum calculated cost (the sum of the squares of the sizes of two connected components plus `c`) if there are multiple connected components.
