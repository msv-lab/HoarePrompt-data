Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `components` is a list with more than one element.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 2.
- `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`.
- `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[2]`.
- `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `i + 1` to `len(components)`.
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop starts at `j = 2` and goes up to `len(components) - 1`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`.
   - `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[2]`.
   - `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 3.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `components` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 3.
   - `cost_i` remains the square of the length of `components[1]`.
   - `cost_j` will be the square of the length of `components[3]` (since `j` is now 3).
   - `min_cost` remains the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `components` is a list with more than one element.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`.
- `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[3]`.
- `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

### Output State:
**`components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[3]`, and `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.**
