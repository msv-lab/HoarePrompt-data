The code initializes `min_cost` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not change the values of the other variables but sets `min_cost` to a known value. Therefore, the output state will include this new value for `min_cost`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells; `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors; `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i; `components` is an integer representing the number of connected components in the graph and is greater than 1; `min_cost` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`).**
