Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `components` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`.
   - `cost_i` is the square of the length of the first element in `components`.
   - `cost_j` is the square of the length of the second element in `components`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(components)`.
   - In the current state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1.

3. **For the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - The loop will execute again if `j` is incremented and still within the range specified by `range(i + 1, len(components))`.
   - Since `i` is 0, the loop condition becomes `j` being in the range `(0 + 1, len(components))` or simply `(1, len(components))`.

4. **Incrementing `j`**:
   - If the loop executes again, `j` will be incremented from 1 to 2 (assuming `len(components)` is at least 2).

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it does not change in this loop.
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `min_cost` remains the same as it is determined based on the initial values of `i` and `j` and will only update if a new minimum cost is found.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` will be 2.
- `min_cost` remains `cost_i + cost_j + c`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
