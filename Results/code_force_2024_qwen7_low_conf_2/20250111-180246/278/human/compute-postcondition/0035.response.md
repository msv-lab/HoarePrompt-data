`cost_i` is assigned the value of the length of `components[i]` squared. Since `i` is 2, `cost_i` becomes the length of `components[2]` squared. The value of `components[j]` is not directly used here, but `j` is the last index of `components`, which must be at least 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`components` must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `components` and must be at least 3; `cost_i` is the length of `components[2]` squared.**
