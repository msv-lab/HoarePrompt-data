The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells.
- `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors.
- `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple `(u_i, v_i)` represents a corridor between cells `u_i` and `v_i`.

The function returns a value based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns `-1`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns `min_cost`, which is the minimum value of `cost_i` (the square of the length of components[i]) + `cost_j` (the square of the length of components[j]) + `c` over all valid iterations of the loop.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `c`, and `edges`, and return either `-1` or the minimum calculated cost based on the given conditions.
