Output State: **`components` must be a list with more than one element, `i` is 0, `j` is the last index of `components`, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found during the loop, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the element at index `i` in `components`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the element at index `j` in `components`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0. The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(components) - 1`.
2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each iteration, `cost_i` is calculated as the square of the length of the element at index `i` in `components`.
   - Similarly, `cost_j` is calculated as the square of the length of the element at index `j` in `components`.
   - `min_cost` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the sum of `cost_i`, `cost_j`, and `c`.
3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will still be 0 because the loop only modifies `j`.
   - `j` will be the last index of `components` (i.e., `len(components) - 1`) because the loop runs until `j` reaches the end of the list.
   - `min_cost` will hold the minimum value of `cost_i + cost_j + c` found during all iterations of the loop.
4. **Special Case**:
   - If `components` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `i` will remain 0, `j` will never be assigned, and `min_cost` will remain at its initial value (which is undefined in this context but typically would be considered as a large or undefined value).

Thus, the final output state reflects the values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
