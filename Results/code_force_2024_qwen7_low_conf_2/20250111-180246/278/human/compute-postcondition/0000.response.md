The function `func_1(n, edges)` is called with `n` and `edges` as arguments. This function likely computes the number of connected components in a graph represented by the number of prison cells (`n`) and the list of bi-directional corridors (`edges`). The variables `m` and `c` are not affected by this function call, so their values remain unchanged.

After the function call, the result of `func_1(n, edges)` is assigned to the variable `components`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `components`, but we know it will be an integer representing the number of connected components in the graph.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of prison cells; `m` is an integer representing the number of bi-directional corridors; `c` is an integer representing the funding required to build a single corridor; `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (u_i, v_i) represents a corridor between cells u_i and v_i; `components` is an integer representing the number of connected components in the graph.**
