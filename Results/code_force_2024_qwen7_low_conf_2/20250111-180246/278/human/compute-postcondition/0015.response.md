`cost_i` is updated to the square of the length of `components[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, `cost_i` becomes the square of the length of `components[0]`. The values of `cost_j`, `min_cost`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`components` must be greater than 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `cost_i` is `len(components[0])**2`, `cost_j` is `len(components[3])`, `min_cost` is updated to `min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)`**
