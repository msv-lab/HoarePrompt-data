The code assigns the value of `len(components[i])**2` to `cost_i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so `cost_i` is set to `len(components[0])**2`. The other variables (`components`, `j`, and `min_cost`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `cost_i` is `len(components[0])**2`, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
