The code `cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2` assigns the value of the square of the length of `components[j]` to `cost_j`. Given the initial conditions:

- `components` must have at least 4 elements.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is the last index of `components` and must be at least 3.
- `cost_i` is the length of `components[2]` squared.

Since `j` is the last index of `components` and `components` has at least 4 elements, `j` is at least 3. Let's denote the length of `components[j]` as `len_j`.

The value of `cost_j` is calculated as `len_j ** 2`. The values of `components`, `i`, and `cost_i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`components` must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is the last index of `components` and must be at least 3; `cost_i` is the length of `components[2]` squared, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`.**
