The code updates the value of `cost_j` to be the square of the length of `components[j]`. Since `j` is the last index of `components`, `len(components[j])` is the length of the last element in `components`. Therefore, `cost_j` is updated to be the square of this length.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is the last index of `components`, `cost_i` remains the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the last element in `components`, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
