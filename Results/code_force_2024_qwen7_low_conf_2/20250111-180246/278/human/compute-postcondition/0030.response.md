`cost_j` is reassigned the value of the square of the length of `components[j]`. Given that `j` is 3, `cost_j` is updated to the square of the length of `components[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[3]`, and `min_cost` is updated to the minimum value between `min_cost` and `cost_i + cost_j + c`.**
