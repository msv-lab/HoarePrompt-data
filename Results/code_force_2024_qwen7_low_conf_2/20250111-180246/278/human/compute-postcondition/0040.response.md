`cost_j` is assigned the value of `len(components[j]) ** 2`. According to the initial state, `j` is one less than the last index of `components`, and `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared. The value of `cost_i` is not directly used in the code, but `cost_j` is calculated based on `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `i` remains unchanged, `j` is one less than the last index of `components`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is one less than the last index of `components`, `cost_i` is the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared**
