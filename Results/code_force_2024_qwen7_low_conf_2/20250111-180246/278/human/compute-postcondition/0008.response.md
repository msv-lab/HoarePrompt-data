`cost_j` is assigned the value of the square of the length of the element in `components` at index `j`. Since `i` is 0, `j` is between 1 and the length of `components`, and `cost_i` is the square of the length of the first element in `components`, the value of `cost_j` will be the square of the length of the element in `components` at index `j`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `components`, `cost_i` is the square of the length of the first element in `components`, `cost_j` is the square of the length of the element in `components` at index `j`**
