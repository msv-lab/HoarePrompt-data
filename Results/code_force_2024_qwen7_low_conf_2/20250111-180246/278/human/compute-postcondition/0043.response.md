The code updates the value of `cost_i` to be the square of the length of `components[i]`. Since `cost_i` was initially the length of `components[i]` squared, the value of `cost_i` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` remains unchanged, `j` is the last index of `components`, `cost_i` remains the length of `components[i]` squared, `cost_j` is the length of `components[j]` squared, `min_cost` is `cost_i + cost_j + c`**
