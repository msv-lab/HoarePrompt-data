Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop is iterating over `range(len(components))`.
   - Therefore, the variables involved are `i`, `components`, and `len(components)`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `n`: Number of prison cells (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `m`: Number of bi-directional corridors (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `c`: Funding required to build a single corridor (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `edges`: List of tuples representing corridors (not directly involved in the loop).
   - `components`: Number of connected components in the graph and is greater than 1.
   - `min_cost`: Set to infinity (`float('inf')`) (not directly involved in the loop).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `components` must be greater than 1 (as given in the initial state).
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `len(components) - 1` in the loop.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - `components` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute.
   - `i` should start at 0 (the initial value for the loop).

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the analysis, the necessary adjustments are:
- `components` must be greater than 1.
- `i` should be initialized to 0.

Thus, the final state needed for the loop to execute is:
**`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**.

### Final Answer:
State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**.
