The code `cost_j = len(components[j])**2` updates the value of `cost_j` to be the square of the length of the list at index `j` in the `components` list. Given the initial state where `components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `cost_i` is `len(components[0])`, we can proceed as follows:

- `cost_j` is updated to be the square of the length of `components[j]`, which is `components[2]`.
- The value of `cost_i` is not affected by this code.
- The values of `components`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Let's assume `components` is a list of lists, and `components[2]` has a specific length, say `k`. Then `cost_j` would be `k**2`.

Since the exact length of `components[2]` is not specified, let's denote its length as `k`. Therefore, `cost_j` is `k**2`.

Output State: **`components` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `cost_i` is `len(components[0])`, `cost_j` is `len(components[2])**2`**
