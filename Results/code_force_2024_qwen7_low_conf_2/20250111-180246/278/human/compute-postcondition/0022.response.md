`cost_j` is assigned the value of the square of the length of `components[j]`. Since `j` must be greater than 1, `components[j]` refers to the element at index 2 or higher in the list `components`. The value of `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`, but this does not affect the value of `cost_j`. Therefore, the Output State is: `components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` must be greater than 1, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`, and `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`.

Output State: **`components` is a list with more than one element, `i` is 1, `j` must be greater than 1, `cost_i` is the square of the length of `components[1]`, and `cost_j` is the square of the length of `components[j]`**
