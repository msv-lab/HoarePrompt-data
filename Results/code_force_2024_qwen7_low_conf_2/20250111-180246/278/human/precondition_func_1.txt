start is an integer representing a cell index (1 ≤ start ≤ n), where n is the number of prison cells. The graph is represented as a dictionary where keys are cell indices and values are lists of neighboring cell indices. visited is a boolean list of length n, initially all set to False, indicating whether each cell has been visited during the BFS traversal.
