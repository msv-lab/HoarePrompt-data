### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to partition the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - Each complex must be connected internally.
   - The cost is calculated as the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two complexes plus the cost of the corridors added to connect them.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function finds all connected components in the graph using BFS. It correctly initializes the graph and uses BFS to find all nodes in each component.
   - **bfs**: This function performs a breadth-first search to explore all nodes reachable from the start node and marks them as visited.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if the graph can be divided into exactly two components. If it cannot, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost to connect two components.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
   - **Component Identification**: The `func_1` function correctly identifies all connected components.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The `func_2` function iterates over all pairs of components to find the minimum cost. However, the current implementation assumes the graph is already processed and does not handle edge cases properly.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code does not handle the case where there are fewer than two components.
   - The BFS function should use the `visited` list from the outer scope, but it is defined locally in `func_1`.
   - The `func_2` function should check if the graph can be split into exactly two components by ensuring the number of components is exactly two.

### Correctness:

- The logic in `func_1` is correct but the `visited` list should be shared across calls.
- The `func_2` function needs to ensure that exactly two components exist before calculating the minimum cost.
- The overall approach to finding the minimum cost is correct but needs adjustments to handle edge cases properly.

### Addressing Edge Cases and Improvements:

1. **Shared Visited List**:
   - The `visited` list should be passed as a parameter to `bfs` and also updated within `func_1` to ensure it is shared across calls.
   
2. **Checking Exactly Two Components**:
   - `func_2` should explicitly check if the number of components is exactly two before proceeding with the cost calculation.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function should handle cases where there are fewer than two components by returning -1.

### Improved Code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

# Function 1: Find all connected components in the graph
def func_1(n, edges):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            component = bfs(i, visited, graph)
            if component:
                components.append(component)
    return components

# Function 2: Perform BFS to explore all nodes reachable from the start node
def bfs(start, visited, graph):
    queue = deque([start])
    component = []
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if not visited[node]:
            visited[node] = True
            component.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if not visited[neighbor]:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    return component if component else None

# Function 3: Calculate the minimum cost to divide the prison into two complexes
def func_2(n, m, c, edges):
    components = func_1(n, edges)
    
    # Check if there are exactly two components
    if len(components) != 2:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(components)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(components)):
            cost_i = len(components[i]) ** 2
            cost_j = len(components[j]) ** 2
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost_i + cost_j + c)
    
    return min_cost
```

### Conclusion:

With the improvements mentioned above, the code now handles edge cases properly and ensures the `visited` list is shared across calls. The logic for finding the minimum cost remains intact.
