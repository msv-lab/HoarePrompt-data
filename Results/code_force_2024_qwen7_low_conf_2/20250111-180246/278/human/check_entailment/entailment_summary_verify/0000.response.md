### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function uses BFS to identify connected components in the graph.
   - It constructs a graph from the given edges and then performs BFS starting from each unvisited node to find all connected nodes.
   - The function returns a list of components, where each component is a set of nodes that are mutually reachable.

2. **Function 2 (`bfs`)**:
   - This function is a standard BFS implementation to find all nodes reachable from a given start node.
   - It marks nodes as visited and collects all reachable nodes in a component.

3. **Function 3 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the list of components.
   - If there is only one component, it returns `-1` because it's impossible to divide the prison into two complexes.
   - Otherwise, it iterates over all pairs of components, calculates the cost as the sum of the squares of their sizes plus the cost `c` of building one connecting corridor, and finds the minimum cost.

Based on the provided function summary, the program seems to follow the logic correctly described:
- It identifies all connected components.
- It checks if the graph can be divided into exactly two complexes.
- It calculates the minimum cost based on the sizes of the components and the cost of the connecting corridor.

However, there are still some potential issues to consider:
- The program assumes that the input is always valid, which might lead to unexpected results if the input is invalid.
- The function does not explicitly handle cases where the graph cannot be divided into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

Given the function summaries and the detailed description of the problem, the program appears to follow the correct approach. The logic for identifying connected components and calculating the minimum cost seems sound.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to identify connected components and calculate the minimum cost to divide the prison into two complexes with one connecting corridor. The provided function summaries and the problem description support this conclusion. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate, and the program is correct.
