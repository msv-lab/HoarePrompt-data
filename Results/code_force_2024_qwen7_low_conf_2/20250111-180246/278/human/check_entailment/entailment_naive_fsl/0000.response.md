Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum funding required to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor. Specifically, the `func_1` and `func_2` functions do not handle the construction of additional corridors needed to achieve the desired division.

Here is a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Component Identification**:
   - The `func_1` function identifies connected components in the graph but does not consider the requirement to connect exactly two complexes with one additional corridor.
   - The `bfs` function inside `func_1` is used to find components but does not account for the possibility of needing to build new corridors to achieve the desired division.

2. **Lack of Corridor Construction Logic**:
   - The program does not include logic to determine the minimum number of new corridors required to connect exactly two complexes.
   - It simply calculates the costs of the components found without considering the additional corridors needed to connect them.

3. **Potential Cases Where the Program Fails**:
   - Consider a simple case with \( n = 4 \), \( m = 3 \), and \( c = 5 \). The corridors are between cells: (1, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 4).
   - The graph forms a single connected component. According to the problem statement, it is impossible to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor, hence the output should be `-1`.
   - However, the current implementation will not correctly identify this scenario and might return an incorrect value.

For example, if we run the program with the input:
```
4 3 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
```
The program will incorrectly compute a value instead of `-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the specific requirement of dividing the prison into exactly two complexes with one connecting corridor, and it does not account for the construction of necessary new corridors.
