### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to partition the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - Each complex must be connected internally.
   - The cost is calculated as the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two complexes plus the cost of the corridors added to connect them.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function finds all connected components in the graph using BFS. It correctly initializes the graph and uses BFS to find all nodes in each component.
   - **bfs**: This function performs a breadth-first search to explore all nodes reachable from the start node and marks them as visited.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if the graph can be divided into exactly two components. If it cannot, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost to connect two components.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
   - **Component Identification**: The `func_1` function correctly identifies all connected components.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The `func_2` function iterates over all pairs of components to find the minimum cost. However, the current implementation assumes the graph is already processed and does not handle edge cases properly.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code does not handle the case where there are fewer than two components.
   - The BFS function should use the `visited` list from the outer scope, but it is defined locally in `func_1`.
   - The `func_2` function should check if the graph can be split into exactly two components by ensuring the number of components is exactly two.

### Correctness:

- The logic in `func_1` is correct but the `visited` list should be shared across calls.
- The `func_2` function needs to ensure that exactly two components exist before calculating the minimum cost.
- The overall approach to finding the minimum cost is correct but needs adjustments to handle edge cases properly.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the functions seem to capture the essence of the solution but lack handling of edge cases and the proper sharing of the `visited` list. 

**Correctness: False**
