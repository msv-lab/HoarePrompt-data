Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to solve the problem of dividing the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor, minimizing the total funding required.
2. The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `bfs`, and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph from the given edges and performs BFS to find all connected components.
   - `bfs` performs a breadth-first search to explore and mark all nodes in a connected component starting from a given node.
   - `func_2` uses the results from `func_1` to determine if the graph can be divided into two components with exactly one connecting corridor. If not, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost based on the sizes of the components and the cost to build a single corridor.
3. The logic in `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the algorithm described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the connected components, checks if the graph can be divided into two parts with one connecting corridor, and calculates the minimum cost accordingly.
4. The code handles the basic case where the graph is completely connected (one component) and returns -1, which is correct according to the problem statement.
5. The nested loops in `func_2` iterate over all pairs of connected components, ensuring that all possible divisions are considered.
6. The calculations for the cost are performed correctly, and the minimum cost is tracked and returned appropriately.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
