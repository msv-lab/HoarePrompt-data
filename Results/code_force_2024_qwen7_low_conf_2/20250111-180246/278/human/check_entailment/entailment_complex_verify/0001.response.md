### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to partition the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - Each complex must be connected internally.
   - The cost is calculated as the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two complexes plus the cost of the corridors added to connect them.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function finds all connected components in the graph using BFS. It correctly initializes the graph and uses BFS to find all nodes in each component.
     - However, the `visited` list is not shared across multiple calls to `func_1`, leading to incorrect results if the graph is processed multiple times.
   - **bfs**: This function performs a breadth-first search to explore all nodes reachable from the start node and marks them as visited.
     - The `visited` list is correctly updated, but it should be shared across multiple calls to `bfs` within `func_1`.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if the graph can be divided into exactly two components. If it cannot, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost to connect two components.
     - The function correctly identifies if there is more than one component, but it does not ensure that exactly two components are formed.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
   - **Component Identification**: The `func_1` function correctly identifies all connected components using BFS. However, the `visited` list should be shared to avoid reprocessing nodes.
   - **Cost Calculation**: The `func_2` function iterates over all pairs of components to find the minimum cost. However, it does not ensure that the graph can be split into exactly two components.
   - **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where there are fewer than two components or where the graph is fully connected. Additionally, the `visited` list should be managed properly to avoid redundant processing.

4. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code does not handle the case where there are fewer than two components.
   - The `func_2` function should check if the graph can be split into exactly two components by ensuring the number of components is exactly two.
   - The `visited` list should be shared across multiple calls to `func_1` to avoid redundant processing.

### Correctness:

- The logic in `func_1` is mostly correct but the `visited` list should be shared across multiple calls.
- The `func_2` function needs to ensure that exactly two components exist before calculating the minimum cost.
- The overall approach to finding the minimum cost is correct but needs adjustments to handle edge cases properly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct but needs some adjustments to address the edge cases and ensure the `visited` list is shared. Here are the specific issues:
- The `visited` list should be shared across calls to `func_1` to avoid redundant processing.
- The `func_2` function should check if the graph can be split into exactly two components by ensuring the number of components is exactly two.

Given these issues, the original assessment is still accurate in pointing out the need for handling edge cases and the improper sharing of the `visited` list. However, the original code does not fully address these issues.

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
