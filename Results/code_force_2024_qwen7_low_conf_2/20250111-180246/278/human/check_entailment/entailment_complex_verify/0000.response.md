### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to divide the prison into exactly two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - The cost of dividing is calculated as the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two complexes plus the cost of building the connecting corridor.
   - The program needs to correctly identify the connected components and determine if it's possible to connect exactly two complexes with one additional corridor.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` uses BFS to identify connected components in the graph.
   - It constructs the graph and visits all nodes, but it does not handle the requirement to connect exactly two complexes.
   - The function returns a list of connected components, but it does not modify the graph to add any new corridors.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` to get the connected components.
   - If there is only one component, it returns `-1` indicating no valid division is possible.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost by iterating over all pairs of components and calculating the cost as the sum of the squares of their sizes plus the cost of the connecting corridor.
   - The function returns the minimum cost.

4. **Corridor Construction Logic**:
   - The program does not explicitly construct any new corridors. It only calculates the cost based on the existing connected components.
   - To ensure the minimum cost is achieved, the program needs to check all possible ways to connect two components with a single new corridor.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where there is only one component, returning `-1`.
   - However, it does not handle the scenario where it is possible to connect exactly two components with one new corridor. The program assumes that the connected components are fixed and does not explore all possible ways to add a single new corridor.

6. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the construction of new corridors to connect exactly two components.
   - The program only calculates the cost based on the existing connected components and does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved by adding the necessary corridors.

Given these points, the program is indeed incorrect because it fails to handle the requirement of constructing exactly one new corridor to connect two complexes.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, specifically the construction of the necessary new corridor to connect exactly two complexes.
