Reasoning:
The provided solution consists of three main functions:

1. `func_1`: Constructs a graph from the given edges and uses BFS to find all connected components.
2. `bfs`: Performs BFS to find all nodes reachable from a given starting node.
3. `func_2`: Uses the results from `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost to divide the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution step-by-step:

1. **Graph Construction and Component Identification (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly constructs an undirected graph using adjacency lists.
   - It performs BFS for each unvisited node, ensuring all nodes are processed.
   - The function returns a list of connected components, which is crucial for determining if a valid division is possible.

2. **Component Calculation and Cost Calculation (`func_2`)**:
   - The function checks if there is only one connected component. If true, it returns `-1` because a valid division is impossible.
   - For each pair of components, it calculates the cost of dividing the prison into those two components with a connecting corridor.
   - The cost is calculated as the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two components plus the cost of the connecting corridor.
   - The function keeps track of the minimum cost found and returns it.

Given the execution summaries:
- `func_1` correctly identifies all connected components.
- `func_2` correctly uses these components to find the minimum cost.

The solution accounts for all possible scenarios, including the edge case where the graph is fully connected (only one component).

Therefore, the provided solution meets the problem description and all given test cases are correctly handled.

Correctness: **True**
