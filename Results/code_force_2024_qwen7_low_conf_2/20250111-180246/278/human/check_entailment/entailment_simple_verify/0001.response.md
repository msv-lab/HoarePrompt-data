### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to partition the prison into two complexes with exactly one connecting corridor.
   - Each complex must be connected internally.
   - The cost is calculated as the sum of the squares of the sizes of the two complexes plus the cost of the corridors added to connect them.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function finds all connected components in the graph using BFS. It correctly initializes the graph and uses BFS to find all nodes in each component.
   - **bfs**: This function performs a breadth-first search to explore all nodes reachable from the start node and marks them as visited.
   - **func_2**: This function checks if the graph can be divided into exactly two components. If it cannot, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum cost to connect two components.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Component Identification**:
     - The `func_1` function correctly identifies all connected components using BFS. It constructs the graph and performs BFS for each unvisited node, collecting all nodes in each component.
     - The BFS function uses a local `visited` list, which is not shared across multiple calls. This is a critical flaw because the `visited` list should be shared to avoid reprocessing nodes unnecessarily and to ensure all nodes are marked as visited.

   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - The `func_2` function iterates over all pairs of components to find the minimum cost. However, it does not handle the case where the number of components is less than 2 or more than 2. This is a significant oversight.

   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The current implementation assumes the graph is already processed, but it does not properly share the `visited` list. This leads to potential issues with redundant processing and incorrect marking of nodes.
     - The `func_2` function should explicitly check if the graph can be split into exactly two components. If not, it should return -1.

4. **Improvements Needed**:
   - Ensure the `visited` list is shared across multiple calls to `func_1`.
   - Add checks in `func_2` to ensure the graph can be split into exactly two components.
   - Handle edge cases where the number of components is not exactly two.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The current implementation has logical flaws due to the shared `visited` list issue and missing edge case handling.
   - The overall approach is correct but needs refinement.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the functions capture the essence of the solution but lack proper handling of the `visited` list and edge cases. The original assessment correctly identified these issues.

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
