The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of prison cells, and a list of tuples `edges` representing bidirectional corridors between cells. It constructs an undirected graph using the provided edges and then performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from each unvisited node. The function returns a list of the results of these BFS operations, where each result is a list of nodes that are reachable from the respective starting node, forming separate connected components. The function ensures that all nodes from 1 to `n` are processed, and only unvisited nodes trigger a BFS operation. If a node is already visited, it is skipped. The function handles the case where the graph might be disconnected, resulting in multiple connected components being identified and returned.
