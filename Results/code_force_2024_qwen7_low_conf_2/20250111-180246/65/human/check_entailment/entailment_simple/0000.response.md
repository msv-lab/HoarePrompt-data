Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   
2. **Condition Checks**:
   - The program checks if the total points `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3` is even. If not, it immediately appends `-1` to the results, indicating inconsistency.
   - It also checks if `p3 > p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it again appends `-1` to the results, indicating inconsistency.
   
3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - If the conditions above are satisfied, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws using the formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.
   - This formula accounts for the fact that draws contribute 1 point to each player, while wins and losses contribute 2 and 0 points, respectively.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are either `-1` or the calculated maximum number of draws.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1**: `0 0 0`
  - `total_points = 0`, which is even.
  - `p3 <= p1 + p2` is true.
  - `max_draws = 0`, so the output is `0`.

- **Test Case 2**: `0 1 1`
  - `total_points = 2`, which is even.
  - `p3 <= p1 + p2` is true.
  - `max_draws = 1`, so the output is `1`.

- **Test Case 3**: `1 1 1`
  - `total_points = 3`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Test Case 4**: `1 1 2`
  - `total_points = 4`, which is even.
  - `p3 <= p1 + p2` is false.
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Test Case 5**: `3 3 3`
  - `total_points = 9`, which is odd.
  - Output: `-1`.

- **Test Case 6**: `3 4 5`
  - `total_points = 12`, which is even.
  - `p3 <= p1 + p2` is true.
  - `max_draws = 6`, so the output is `6`.

- **Test Case 7**: `1 1 10`
  - `total_points = 12`, which is even.
  - `p3 <= p1 + p2` is false.
  - Output: `-1`.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and follows the logic specified in the problem description, thus it is correct.
