Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes an empty list `test_cases` to store the input data.
2. For each test case, the program splits the input into three integers (p1, p2, p3) and stores them in a tuple within the `test_cases` list.
3. The function `func_1` processes each test case from the `test_cases` list.
4. The function checks two conditions:
   - `total_points % 2 != 0`: This condition ensures that the sum of the points is even, which is necessary because each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - `p3 > p1 + p2`: This condition ensures that the highest score is not greater than the sum of the other two scores, as this would imply an impossible distribution of wins and draws.
5. If either of these conditions fails, the function appends `-1` to the `results` list.
6. Otherwise, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.
7. The function then appends the calculated number of draws to the `results` list.
8. After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.

Given the problem statement and the provided example cases, the program logic appears to be correct. It correctly handles the input constraints and calculates the maximum number of draws or returns `-1` when the conditions are not met.

Correctness: **True**
