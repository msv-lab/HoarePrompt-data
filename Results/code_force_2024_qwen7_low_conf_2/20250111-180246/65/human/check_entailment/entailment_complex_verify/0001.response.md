### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the code and the logic step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The scores are stored in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It calculates the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks two conditions to ensure the scores are valid:
     - The total points must be even (`total_points % 2 != 0`).
     - The highest score `p3` should not exceed the sum of the other two scores (`p3 <= p1 + p2`).
   - If either condition fails, it appends `-1` to the results indicating an invalid set of scores.
   - If the scores are valid, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of the Conditions:

- **Total Points Condition**:
  - The condition `total_points % 2 != 0` is unnecessary and incorrect. The total points must be even, not odd. Each game contributes exactly 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1), so the total points must always be even. Removing this check simplifies the logic without affecting correctness.

- **Sum of Scores Condition**:
  - The condition `p3 <= p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players. This condition is necessary to ensure that the scores are achievable through a series of games. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to guarantee that the scores can be achieved. We need to consider the distribution of wins and draws more carefully.

### Calculation of Maximum Draws:

- The formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` is used to calculate the maximum number of draws. This formula is designed to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. However, it does not account for all possible distributions of wins and draws.

### Counterexample:

Consider the test case:
```
1
2 3 4
```

- Total points: `2 + 3 + 4 = 9` (which is odd, but this condition is removed in the original code).
- Highest score: `4 <= 2 + 3` (which is true).

Using the formula:
- `min(2, 4 - 3) = min(2, 1) = 1`
- `min(3, 4 - 2) = min(3, 2) = 2`
- `max_draws = 1 + 2 = 3`

However, the actual maximum number of draws can be determined by distributing the points differently:
- One game with a draw: `1 + 1` (total 2 points, remaining points: `2 + 3 + 2 = 7`)
- Remaining points: `2 + 3 + 2` can be distributed as 2 wins for the third player and 1 win for the second player, resulting in `1 + 1 + 1` (total 3 draws).

Thus, the correct maximum number of draws should be `3`, not `3`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment missed the fact that the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is not always optimal. The provided solution does not account for all possible distributions of wins and draws, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
