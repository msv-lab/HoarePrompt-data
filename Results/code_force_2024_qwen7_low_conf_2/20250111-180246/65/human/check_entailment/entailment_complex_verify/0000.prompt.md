You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of strings, where each string represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `test_cases` is a list of tuples (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `results` is a list that contains `-1` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that fails the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, and `max_draws` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that passes the condition, where `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1).`

    #`results` is a list that contains `-1` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that fails the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, and `max_draws` for each tuple (p1, p3 - p2) that passes the condition, where `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `test_cases`, where each string represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. It processes each test case to determine whether certain conditions are met. If the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2` are not satisfied, the function appends `-1` to the `results` list. If the conditions are met, the function calculates `max_draws` using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the `results` list. After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the total points are odd or when `p3` exceeds `p1 + p2`. According to the problem description, if the total points are not divisible by 2, or if `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, it is impossible to achieve those scores with the given rules, and the program should return `-1`.

However, the current implementation does not check these conditions properly. Specifically, the condition `total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2` is not sufficient to cover all invalid cases. For instance, consider the test case `1 1 10`:

- Total points: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (which is even).
- `p3` (10) is not greater than `p1 + p2` (1 + 1 = 2).

But this case should still return `-1` because the only way to achieve 10 points for the third player would require more points from the first two players than they can collectively achieve without having more games than the constraints allow. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the sum of points for the first two players is at least equal to the points of the third player minus the maximum possible points from draws. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum possible draws
        max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the total points
        if max_draws * 2 > total_points:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(max_draws)
    return results
```

This version checks if the total points can be evenly split and ensures that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the total points.
