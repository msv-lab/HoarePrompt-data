Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identified issues in the provided function, particularly in how it handles the conditions for returning `-1`. The assessment provided a detailed explanation of why the current implementation fails to correctly identify invalid cases, especially for the test case `1 1 10`.

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to verify the corrected function:

1. **Total Points Check**: The condition `total_points % 2 != 0` correctly identifies cases where the total points are odd, which cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules.

2. **Sum Check**: The condition `p3 > p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players. This prevents invalid scenarios where the third player's score is too high to be achieved.

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The calculation `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` is correct for determining the maximum possible draws. This accounts for the fact that in a draw, both players get 1 point each.

4. **Additional Validation**: The additional check `if max_draws * 2 > total_points:` ensures that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the total points. This prevents scenarios where the calculated number of draws would result in more points being distributed than available.

Given these checks, the corrected function now accurately identifies invalid cases and provides the correct maximum number of draws for valid cases. The original assessment was accurate, and the proposed corrections address the identified issues.

Final: **True**
