Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where the total points are odd or when `p3` exceeds `p1 + p2`. According to the problem description, if the total points are not divisible by 2, or if `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, it is impossible to achieve those scores with the given rules, and the program should return `-1`.

However, the current implementation does not check these conditions properly. Specifically, the condition `total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2` is not sufficient to cover all invalid cases. For instance, consider the test case `1 1 10`:

- Total points: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (which is even).
- `p3` (10) is not greater than `p1 + p2` (1 + 1 = 2).

But this case should still return `-1` because the only way to achieve 10 points for the third player would require more points from the first two players than they can collectively achieve without having more games than the constraints allow. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the sum of points for the first two players is at least equal to the points of the third player minus the maximum possible points from draws. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in test_cases:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        # Calculate the maximum possible draws
        max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
        # Ensure the calculated draws do not exceed the total points
        if max_draws * 2 > total_points:
            results.append(-1)
        else:
            results.append(max_draws)
    return results
```

This version checks if the total points can be evenly split and ensures that the calculated number of draws does not exceed the total points.
