### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step, using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The scores are stored in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It calculates the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks two conditions to ensure the scores are valid:
     - The total points must be even (`total_points % 2 != 0`).
     - The highest score `p3` should not exceed the sum of the other two scores (`p3 <= p1 + p2`).
   - If either condition fails, it appends `-1` to the results indicating an invalid set of scores.
   - If the scores are valid, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Condition Checking**:
  - The condition `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points scored by all players is even, which is necessary because each game contributes 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
  - The condition `p3 <= p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable through a series of games.

- **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
  - The formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` is designed to calculate the maximum number of draws. However, there are some issues with this formula:
    - When both `p1` and `p2` are less than `p3 - p2` and `p3 - p1` respectively, the formula might incorrectly overestimate the number of draws.
    - Specifically, if `p1` and `p2` are both less than `p3 - p2` and `p3 - p1`, the formula will count these as separate draws, but they can actually be combined into a single game that ends in a draw.
    - The correct approach should be to consider the total points and the distribution of wins and draws more carefully.

### Example Counter-Examples:

1. **Case (1, 1, 1)**:
   - Total points: 3 (odd), so the condition fails directly.
   - Correct output: -1.
   - Program output: -1.
   - Correct.

2. **Case (1, 1, 2)**:
   - Total points: 4 (even).
   - `p3` (2) â‰¤ `p1 + p2` (1 + 1).
   - Max draws: `min(1, 2 - 1) + min(1, 2 - 1) = 1 + 1 = 2`.
   - Correct output: 2.
   - Program output: 2.
   - Correct.

3. **Case (1, 1, 10)**:
   - Total points: 12 (even).
   - `p3` (10) > `p1 + p2` (1 + 1).
   - Correct output: -1.
   - Program output: 2.
   - Incorrect. The program incorrectly calculates 2 draws when the maximum possible draws should be 0 since the condition `p3 <= p1 + p2` fails.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment did not fully account for the edge cases where the maximum number of draws might be incorrectly calculated. The formula used to calculate `max_draws` can lead to overestimation in certain scenarios.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
