You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The scores are stored in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It calculates the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks two conditions to ensure the scores are valid:
     - The total points must be even (`total_points % 2 != 0`).
     - The highest score `p3` should not exceed the sum of the other two scores (`p3 <= p1 + p2`).
   - If either condition fails, it appends `-1` to the results indicating an invalid set of scores.
   - If the scores are valid, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Condition Checking**:
  - The condition `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points scored by all players is even, which is necessary because each game contributes 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
  - The condition `p3 <= p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable through a series of games.

- **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
  - The formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` calculates the maximum number of draws. This formula accounts for the possibility of draws in such a way that it maximizes the number of games ending in draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the provided code, it correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each set of scores. The conditions and calculations are appropriate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
