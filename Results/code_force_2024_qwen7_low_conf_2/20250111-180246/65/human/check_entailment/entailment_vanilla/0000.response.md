### Reasoning:

The provided Python program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games among three players, given their final scores. Let's analyze the code step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The scores are stored in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It calculates the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks two conditions to ensure the scores are valid:
     - The total points must be even (`total_points % 2 != 0`).
     - The highest score `p3` should not exceed the sum of the other two scores (`p3 <= p1 + p2`).
   - If either condition fails, it appends `-1` to the results indicating an invalid set of scores.
   - If the scores are valid, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Condition Checking**:
  - The condition `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points scored by all players is even, which is necessary because each game contributes 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
  - The condition `p3 <= p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable through a series of games.

- **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
  - The formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` calculates the maximum number of draws. This formula accounts for the possibility of draws in such a way that it maximizes the number of games ending in draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the provided code, it correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each set of scores. The conditions and calculations are appropriate and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
