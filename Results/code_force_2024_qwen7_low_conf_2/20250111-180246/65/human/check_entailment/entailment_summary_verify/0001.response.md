### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the code and the function `func_1` in detail to verify the correctness of the provided solution.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - The scores are stored in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case to determine the maximum number of draws.
   - It calculates the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks two conditions to ensure the scores are valid:
     - The total points must be even (`total_points % 2 != 0`).
     - The highest score `p3` should not exceed the sum of the other two scores (`p3 <= p1 + p2`).
   - If either condition fails, it appends `-1` to the results indicating an invalid set of scores.
   - If the scores are valid, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Condition Checking**:
  - The condition `total_points % 2 != 0` ensures that the total points scored by all players is even, which is necessary because each game contributes 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).
  - The condition `p3 <= p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score does not exceed the combined scores of the other two players, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be achievable through a series of games.

- **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
  - The formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` calculates the maximum number of draws. This formula accounts for the possibility of draws in such a way that it maximizes the number of games ending in draws while ensuring the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Edge Case Analysis:

1. **Case 0 0 0**:
   - Total points: 0
   - Conditions: `0 % 2 == 0` (valid), `0 <= 0 + 0` (valid)
   - Result: `0` draws

2. **Case 0 1 1**:
   - Total points: 2
   - Conditions: `2 % 2 == 0` (valid), `1 <= 0 + 1` (valid)
   - Result: `1` draw

3. **Case 1 1 1**:
   - Total points: 3
   - Conditions: `3 % 2 != 0` (invalid)
   - Result: `-1`

4. **Case 1 1 2**:
   - Total points: 4
   - Conditions: `4 % 2 == 0` (valid), `2 <= 1 + 1` (invalid)
   - Result: `-1`

5. **Case 3 3 3**:
   - Total points: 9
   - Conditions: `9 % 2 != 0` (invalid)
   - Result: `-1`

6. **Case 3 4 5**:
   - Total points: 12
   - Conditions: `12 % 2 == 0` (valid), `5 <= 3 + 4` (valid)
   - Result: `6` draws

7. **Case 1 1 10**:
   - Total points: 12
   - Conditions: `12 % 2 == 0` (valid), `10 <= 1 + 1` (invalid)
   - Result: `-1`

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly handles the edge cases and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately based on the given constraints. The function `func_1` appropriately checks the conditions and calculates the maximum number of draws.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
