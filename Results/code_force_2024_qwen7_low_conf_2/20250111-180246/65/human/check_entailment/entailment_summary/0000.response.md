Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the total points (`p1 + p2 + p3`) are even (`total_points % 2 != 0`). If they are not even, it implies an inconsistency since the sum of points from games (each game contributing either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players in case of a draw) should always be even. Thus, the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` correctly identifies an inconsistent scenario.

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. This calculation is correct because:
   - A draw between two players contributes 1 point to each, thus a draw between Player 1 and Player 2 would increment `p1` and `p2` by 1.
   - Similarly, a draw between Player 2 and Player 3 would increment `p2` and `p3` by 1.
   - The minimum values used in the formula ensure that we account for the maximum number of draws without exceeding the points of the players.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The code correctly handles scenarios where `p3 > p1 + p2`, which indicates an impossible distribution of points. In such cases, it returns `-1`.
   - For the given examples, the code produces the correct outputs:
     - `(0, 0, 0)` results in `0` draws.
     - `(0, 1, 1)` results in `1` draw.
     - `(1, 1, 1)` is an invalid scenario, resulting in `-1`.
     - `(1, 1, 2)` results in `2` draws.
     - `(3, 3, 3)` is another invalid scenario, resulting in `-1`.
     - `(3, 4, 5)` results in `6` draws.
     - `(1, 1, 10)` results in `2` draws.

Given that the function accurately performs the necessary checks and calculations, and the edge cases are handled appropriately, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
