`results.append(-1)` adds the value `-1` to the list `results`. The initial state tells us that `results` is an empty list, so after appending `-1`, `results` will contain `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), `results` is [-1], `total_points` is the sum of p1, p2, and p3, and either `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`**
