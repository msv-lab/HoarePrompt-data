The code `results.append(max_draws)` appends the value of `max_draws` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `max_draws` is defined as `p1 + p2`, and the other conditions about `total_points` and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `max_draws` is `p1 + p2`; `results` now contains `max_draws`; if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 == 1` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, `results` contains at least one `-1`, otherwise `results` does not contain `-1`.**
