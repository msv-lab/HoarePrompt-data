The code assigns the value of `p1 + p2 + p3` to `total_points`. This means the value of `total_points` is updated based on the current values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

- The initial state is that `test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1'', p2'', p3'')\) such that \(0 \leq p1'' \leq p2'' \leq p3'' \leq 30\); `total_points` is \(p1'' + p2'' + p3''\); `max_draws` is \(p1'' + p2''\); `results` does not contain `-1` unless the conditions \((p1'' + p2'' + p3'') \% 2 == 1\) or \(p3'' > p1'' + p2''\) are met.
- After executing the line `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`, `total_points` is now equal to \(p1 + p2 + p3\), which is the sum of the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. 

The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. The condition for `results` remains the same.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1'', p2'', p3'')\) such that \(0 \leq p1'' \leq p2'' \leq p3'' \leq 30\); `total_points` is \(p1 + p2 + p3\); `max_draws` is \(p1 + p2\); `results` does not contain `-1` unless the conditions \((p1 + p2 + p3) \% 2 == 1\) or \(p3 > p1 + p2\) are met.**
