The code updates the `max_draws` variable. The new value of `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `total_points`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Let's break down the calculation:

- `min(p1, p3 - p2)` will take the minimum value between `p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `min(p2, p3 - p1)` will take the minimum value between `p2` and `p3 - p1`.

Therefore, the updated value of `max_draws` will be the sum of these two minimum values.

Since the exact values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not specified in the initial state, we can express `max_draws` in terms of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1'', p2'', p3'') such that 0 ≤ p1'' ≤ p2'' ≤ p3'' ≤ 30; `total_points` is p1 + p2 + p3; `max_draws` is min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1); `results` contains -1 if either (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2; otherwise, `results` does not contain -1.**
