To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the requirements for the loop to continue.

### Given Conditions:
1. `test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
2. `results` is now \([-1, max_draws]\).
3. `total_points` is the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\).
4. Either `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.
5. `max_draws` is calculated as \(\min(p1, p3 - p2) + \min(p2, p3 - p1)\).

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over each tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) in `test_cases`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Assumptions**: The loop must still have at least one tuple in `test_cases` to continue iterating.
2. **Next Iteration Requirements**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one tuple left in `test_cases`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `test_cases` must still contain at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) that satisfies the given conditions. Since the problem does not specify any changes to the elements of `test_cases` within the loop, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `test_cases` still contains at least one tuple.

### Final State:
State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\)**
