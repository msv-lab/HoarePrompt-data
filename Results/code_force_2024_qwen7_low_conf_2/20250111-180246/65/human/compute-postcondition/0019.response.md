The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the variables `test_cases`, `total_points`, `max_draws`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1'', p2'', p3'') such that 0 ≤ p1'' ≤ p2'' ≤ p3'' ≤ 30; `total_points` is p1 + p2 + p3; `max_draws` is p1 + p2; `results` contains -1**
