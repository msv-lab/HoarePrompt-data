According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` contains at least one string representing a valid test case.

Before the loop starts, `results` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is a list of strings where each string represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).

For the loop to be executed, `test_cases` must contain at least one string that meets the criteria described above. The initial state does not provide enough information about the content of `test_cases`, but we know it must have at least one valid test case for the loop to execute.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must contain at least one valid test case.

State: **`test_cases` must contain at least one string representing a valid test case (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\), and `results` is an empty list**
