The code `results.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. This operation changes the value of `results` but does not affect the other variables like `test_cases`, `total_points`, `max_draws`, or the specific tuples within `test_cases`.

Given the initial state, the following conditions hold:
- `test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1'', p2'', p3'')\) such that \(0 \leq p1'' \leq p2'' \leq p3'' \leq 30\).
- `total_points` is \(p1 + p2 + p3\).
- `max_draws` is \(p1 + p2\).
- `results` does not contain `-1` unless the conditions \((p1 + p2 + p3) \% 2 == 1\) or \(p3 > p1 + p2\) are met.

After executing the code, the condition that `results` does not contain `-1` is violated because `-1` has been appended to `results`. Therefore, the new state for `results` is that it now contains `-1`.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1'', p2'', p3'') such that 0 ≤ p1'' ≤ p2'' ≤ p3'' ≤ 30; `total_points` is p1 + p2 + p3; `max_draws` is p1 + p2; `results` contains -1.**
