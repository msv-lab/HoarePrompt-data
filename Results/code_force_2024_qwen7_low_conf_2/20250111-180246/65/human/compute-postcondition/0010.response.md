`total_points` is assigned the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial conditions state that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), and the code calculates the sum of these three values. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`**
