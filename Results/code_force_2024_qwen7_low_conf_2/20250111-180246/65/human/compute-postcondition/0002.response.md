The code assigns the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` to `total_points`. Given that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are elements of a tuple in `test_cases` and are constrained by \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), `total_points` will be their sum. The `results` list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), `results` is an empty list, and `total_points` is the sum of p1, p2, and p3.**
