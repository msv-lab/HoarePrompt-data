The `results` list is appended with the value `-1`. The `test_cases` and `total_points` variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `results` contains at least one `-1`.
