The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The `continue` statement simply indicates that the loop would continue to its next iteration if it were present.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), `results` is [-1], `total_points` is the sum of p1, p2, and p3, and either `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`.**
