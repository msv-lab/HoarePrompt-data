`results` is appended with the value of `max_draws`. The calculation of `max_draws` is as follows: `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), `results` is now [-1, max_draws], `total_points` is the sum of p1, p2, and p3, and either `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**
