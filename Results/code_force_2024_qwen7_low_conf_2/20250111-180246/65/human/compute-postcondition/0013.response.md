Postcondition: ***`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`. If either `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, then `results` contains at least one `-1`. Otherwise, `results` does not contain `-1`.***
