Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `test_cases`, where each string represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. It processes each test case to determine whether certain conditions are met. If the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2` are not satisfied, the function appends `-1` to the `results` list. If the conditions are met, the function calculates `max_draws` using the formula `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` and appends this value to the `results` list. After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the condition `p3 > p1 + p2` and appends `-1` accordingly.
- The function correctly handles the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` and appends `-1` accordingly.
- The function correctly calculates `max_draws` when both conditions are met using the provided formula.
- However, the annotation and the code do not mention any specific handling for the case where `p1 == p2 == p3`. In such a scenario, `max_draws` would be 0 since `min(p1, p3 - p2)` and `min(p2, p3 - p1)` would both be 0. This is an edge case that should be considered.

Therefore, the function `func_1` effectively processes each test case and appends either `-1` or `max_draws` to the `results` list based on the given conditions, with the understanding that `max_draws` is 0 when `p1 == p2 == p3`.
