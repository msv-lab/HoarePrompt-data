Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step and derive the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple (p1, p2, p3) satisfies \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- `results` is initially an empty list.

### Loop Code
```python
for p1, p2, p3 in test_cases:
    total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
    if total_points % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2:
        results.append(-1)
        continue
    max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)
    results.append(max_draws)
```

### Analysis
1. **Condition Check**: For each tuple (p1, p2, p3) in `test_cases`, the loop performs the following checks:
   - If `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, then `results.append(-1)` and the loop continues without appending any value to `results`.
   - Otherwise, `results.append(max_draws)` where `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.

2. **Final State**:
   - If no tuple in `test_cases` satisfies the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, then `results` will only contain valid `max_draws` values.
   - If at least one tuple in `test_cases` fails the condition, then `-1` will be appended to `results` for those tuples.

### Output State
- `test_cases` remains unchanged as it is only used for iteration.
- `results` will contain a mix of `-1` and valid `max_draws` values based on the conditions checked during the loop.

### Conclusion
The final output state after all iterations of the loop will be:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples (p1, p2, p3) where each tuple satisfies \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- `results` is a list that contains:
  - `-1` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that fails the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`.
  - `max_draws` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that passes the condition, where `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `results` is a list that contains `-1` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that fails the condition `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2`, and `max_draws` for each tuple (p1, p2, p3) that passes the condition, where `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1).`**
