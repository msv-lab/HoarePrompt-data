Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
   - `total_points` is \(p1 + p2 + p3\).
   - `max_draws` is \(p1 + p2\).
   - `results` now contains `max_draws`.
   - If \((p1 + p2 + p3) \% 2 == 1\) or \(p3 > p1 + p2\), `results` contains at least one `-1`. Otherwise, `results` does not contain `-1`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) in `test_cases`.

3. **Key Variables**:
   - `test_cases`: A list of tuples \((p1, p2, p3)\).
   - `total_points`: The sum of the values in the current tuple.
   - `max_draws`: The sum of the first two values in the current tuple.
   - `results`: A list that stores results based on conditions.

4. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the current tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\), we need to check the conditions:
     - If \((p1 + p2 + p3) \% 2 == 1\) or \(p3 > p1 + p2\), add `-1` to `results`.
     - Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.

5. **State After Previous Iteration**:
   - Assume the current tuple processed is \((p1', p2', p3')\).
   - `total_points` would be updated to \(p1' + p2' + p3'\).
   - `max_draws` would be updated to \(p1' + p2'\).
   - `results` would either remain unchanged or get an additional `-1` if the conditions were met.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, we need the next tuple \((p1'', p2'', p3'')\) from `test_cases`.
   - Ensure that `test_cases` still contains at least one tuple.
   - `total_points` should be the sum of the next tuple.
   - `max_draws` should be the sum of the first two values of the next tuple.
   - `results` should not contain `-1` unless the conditions are met for the new tuple.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, we need the next tuple from `test_cases` to satisfy the initial conditions. The state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1'', p2'', p3'')\) such that \(0 \leq p1'' \leq p2'' \leq p3'' \leq 30\); `total_points` is \(p1'' + p2'' + p3''\); `max_draws` is \(p1'' + p2''\); `results` does not contain `-1` unless the conditions \((p1'' + p2'' + p3'') \% 2 == 1\) or \(p3'' > p1'' + p2''\) are met.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration with the necessary conditions met.
