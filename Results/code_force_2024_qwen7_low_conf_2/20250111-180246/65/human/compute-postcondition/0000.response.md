The code initializes an empty list called `results`. The initial state includes `test_cases` being a list of strings where each string represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. No changes are made to `test_cases` or any other variables in this code snippet.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of strings, where each string represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `results` is an empty list**
