The code `results.append(max_draws)` appends the value of `max_draws` to the list `results`. Since `max_draws` is already defined in the initial state, the value of `max_draws` remains unchanged, but it is now added to the list `results`.

The initial conditions are:
- `test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1'', p2'', p3'') such that 0 ≤ p1'' ≤ p2'' ≤ p3'' ≤ 30;
- `total_points` is p1 + p2 + p3;
- `max_draws` is min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1);
- `results` contains -1 if either (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2; otherwise, `results` does not contain -1.

After executing the code, `results` will include the value of `max_draws` appended to its current contents. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1'', p2'', p3'') such that 0 ≤ p1'' ≤ p2'' ≤ p3'' ≤ 30; `total_points` is p1 + p2 + p3; `max_draws` is min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - 1); `results` contains -1 if either (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0 or p3 > p1 + p2; otherwise, `results` contains the previous value of `results` plus `max_draws`.**
