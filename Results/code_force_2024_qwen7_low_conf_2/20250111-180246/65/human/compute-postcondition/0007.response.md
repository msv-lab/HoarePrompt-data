The code calculates `max_draws` based on the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `min(p1, p3 - p2)` will take the minimum value between `p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `min(p2, p3 - p1)` will take the minimum value between `p2` and `p3 - p1`.

The formula `max_draws = min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)` updates the value of `max_draws`, but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `total_points`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple (p1, p2, p3) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\), `results` is either an empty list or [-1], `total_points` is the sum of p1, p2, and p3, and either `total_points` is odd or `p3` is greater than `p1 + p2`, `max_draws` is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`**.
