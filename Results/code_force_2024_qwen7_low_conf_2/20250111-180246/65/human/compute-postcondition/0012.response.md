The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables, but it does affect the flow of the loop. Since the initial state includes the conditions for the variables and there's no loop or conditional block that this `continue` statement is part of, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` contains at least one tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\); `total_points` is `p1 + p2 + p3`; `results` contains at least one `-1`.**
