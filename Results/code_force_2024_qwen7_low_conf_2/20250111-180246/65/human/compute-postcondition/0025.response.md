The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of strings. Each string in the list represents a test case containing three integers separated by spaces (p_1, p_2, p_3) such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

The function returns a list `results`. For each tuple (p1, p2, p3), if the conditions `total_points % 2 != 0` or `p3 > p1 + p2` are not met, the corresponding element in `results` is `-1`. Otherwise, the element in `results` is `max_draws`, which is calculated as `min(p1, p3 - p2) + min(p2, p3 - p1)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of strings `test_cases`, and for each test case, calculate and return either `-1` if the given conditions are not satisfied or `max_draws` if they are satisfied.
