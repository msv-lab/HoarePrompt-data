Reasoning: 
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes the available days for each lecturer.
2. The logic for calculating the cumulative availability of lecturers over each day is correct. This step is essential for determining whether a given window of days has enough lecturers available.
3. The program iterates through all possible window sizes from 1 to `n` and correctly counts the number of valid segments for each window size.
4. The function `func_1` handles the case where no lecturers are available on any day, and it ensures that the result is only returned for valid window sizes up to `n`.
5. The overall approach and implementation align with the problem statement and the execution summary provided.

Correctness: **True**
