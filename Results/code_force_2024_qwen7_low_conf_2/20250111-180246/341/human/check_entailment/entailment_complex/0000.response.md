Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input data and stores it in a structured format.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem as specified in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of its logic:
   - It first constructs an `availability` array to keep track of the number of lecturers available on each day.
   - It then calculates the cumulative availability for each day, ensuring that the value at any index `d` in `availability` represents the total number of lecturers available on day `d`.
   - Next, it iterates over possible window sizes from 1 to `n` and calculates the number of valid windows for each size. A valid window is defined as a sequence of consecutive days where the total number of available lecturers is at least the window size.
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where no lecturers are available on any day.
3. The final output matches the expected format, providing the number of valid windows for each window size from 1 to `n`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
