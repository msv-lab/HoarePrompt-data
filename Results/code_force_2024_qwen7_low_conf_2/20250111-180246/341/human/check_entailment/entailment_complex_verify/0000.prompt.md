You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been asked to organize a very important art conference. The first
step is to choose the dates.

The conference must last for a certain number of consecutive days. Each day,
one lecturer must perform, and the same lecturer cannot perform more than
once.

You asked n potential lecturers if they could participate in the conference.
Lecturer i indicated that they could perform on any day from l_i to r_i
inclusive.

A certain segment of days can be chosen as the conference dates if there is a
way to assign an available lecturer to each day of the segment, assigning each
lecturer to no more than one day.

For each k from 1 to n , find how many ways there are to choose a segment of k
consecutive days as the conference dates.

Input

The first line of input contains one integer n — the number of potential
lecturers (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Each of the next n lines contains two integers l_i and r_i — the segment of
available days for the i th lecturer (1 \le l_i \le r_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ).

Output

Print n integers, where the k th number denotes the number of ways to select a
segment of k consecutive days as conference dates.

Note

In the first testcase, a one-day conference can be organized on any of the
days from 1 to 6 . A two-day conference can be organized from day 2 to day 3 ,
as well as from day 4 to day 5 .

In the second testcase, five lecturers can perform only from day 1 to day 3 ,
so it will not be possible to organize a conference longer than three days.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers`, a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer. It processes this data to determine the number of valid windows of consecutive days where the sum of the number of available lecturers is at least the window size `k`. The function first constructs an `availability` array to count the number of lecturers available on each day. Then, it calculates the cumulative availability for each day. Finally, it iterates through possible window sizes from 1 to `n` and counts the number of valid windows for each size, storing these counts in the `result` list. The function returns a list of `n` integers, where each element indicates the number of valid windows found for the corresponding window size `k` (from 1 to `n`). The function handles edge cases such as when no lecturers are available on any day, and it ensures that the result is only returned for valid window sizes up to `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose a segment of k consecutive days as conference dates. Specifically, the logic for counting the available days is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

According to the problem description, we expect the output to be:
```
8
4
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program gives the following output:
```
8
4
2
0
0
```

The issue lies in the way the `current_window_sum` is calculated and updated. The program does not correctly handle the sliding window sum to ensure that the sum of available days within the window is at least k. This leads to incorrect counts for some values of k.

To fix this, the program needs to accurately count the number of days that have at least one available lecturer for each segment of k consecutive days.
