Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose a segment of k consecutive days as conference dates. Specifically, the logic for counting the available days is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
```

According to the problem description, we expect the output to be:
```
8
4
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program gives the following output:
```
8
4
2
0
0
```

The issue lies in the way the `current_window_sum` is calculated and updated. The program does not correctly handle the sliding window sum to ensure that the sum of available days within the window is at least k. This leads to incorrect counts for some values of k.

To fix this, the program needs to accurately count the number of days that have at least one available lecturer for each segment of k consecutive days.
