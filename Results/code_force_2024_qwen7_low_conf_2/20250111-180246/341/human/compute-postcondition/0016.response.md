The code sets `available_days[day]` to the value of `current_available`. Given that `day` is 1, this means `available_days[1]` is now equal to `current_available`. The initial state tells us that `current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `current_available` remains unchanged, and `available_days[1]` is updated.

Output State: **`current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, `day` is 1**
