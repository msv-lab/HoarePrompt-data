`n` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `n` is not specified. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition `(pq)` remains false since `pq` is still an empty priority queue.

Output State: **`vc[2]` is a non-empty list, `i` is the index of the last element in `vc[2]`, `j` is the new last element of `vc[2]` (which is the largest element of `vc[2]` after all smallest elements are removed), `pq` is an empty priority queue since all elements have been removed from it, and `m` is the same as its initial value; `n` is incremented by 1; the condition `(pq)` is false.**
