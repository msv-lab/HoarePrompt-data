The code decrements the value at index `r + 1` in the `availability` list by 1. Since `availability` is initialized as a list of `max_day + 2` zeros, the initial value at `availability[r + 1]` is 0. After decrementing, the value at `availability[r + 1]` becomes `-1`.

The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers; `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers and the loop is about to process the next pair; `max_day` is 200,000; `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the value at index `r + 1` equal to -1.**
