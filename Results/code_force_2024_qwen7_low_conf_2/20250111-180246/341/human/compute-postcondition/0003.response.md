The code `availability[l] += 1` increments the value at index `l` in the `availability` list by 1, where `l` is the first element of each pair in the `lecturers` list. The `lecturers` list contains pairs of integers `(l_i, r_i)`, where `l_i` represents the start day of availability for each lecturer. Since the initial state of `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros (with `max_day` being 200000), the value at index `l_i` will be incremented by 1 for each lecturer. The `n`, `lecturers`, `max_day`, and the initial state of `availability` remain unchanged except for the increment operation performed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers [(l_i, r_i)], where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, `max_day` is 200000, `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the value at index `l_i` incremented by 1 for each lecturer, and the loop can execute if `lecturers` is non-empty.**
