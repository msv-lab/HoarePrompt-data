According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` is 2, which means that the loop has already executed for `i = 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3.

Let's analyze the current state and what needs to change:

- `i` was 2, so for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be 3.
- The other variables (`l`, `r`, `b`, `c`, `d`) do not depend on `i` directly and remain unchanged as long as `i` does not affect them in the loop body.

Thus, we only need to adjust `i` to be 3, and the other variables should remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 3; `l` is `a[2][0]`; `r` is `a[2][1]`; `b[a[2][0]]` is `a[2][1]`; `c[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][1] + 1]` is decremented by 1**
