Postcondition: ***`result[k+1]` is 0, `count` is either 2 or 3, `current_window_sum` is current_window_sum + (available_days[start + k - 1] - available_days[start - 1]), `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]` plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`, and `start` must be in the range [3, max_day - k + 2]. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, `count` is incremented by 1.***
