Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `current_window_sum` is the previous value of `current_window_sum` plus `available_days[start + k - 1]` minus `available_days[start - 1]`.
   - `start` is `s + 1`.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true.
   - `result` remains unchanged unless `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true and `result[k + 1]` is updated.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop runs for `start` values from `2` to `max_day - k + 2`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration:**
   - `start` will be incremented by 1, so the new `start` will be `s + 2`.
   - `current_window_sum` will be updated based on the new `start` value: `current_window_sum` becomes the previous value of `current_window_sum` plus `available_days[start + k - 1]` minus `available_days[start - 1]`.
   - `count` will be incremented by 1 if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true during this iteration.
   - `result` will be updated if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true and `result[k + 1]` is not already updated.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- `start` will be `s + 2`.
- `current_window_sum` will be recalculated based on the new `start` value.
- `count` will be incremented if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true.
- `result` will be updated if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true and `result[k + 1]` is not already updated.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**

- `current_window_sum` will be the previous value of `current_window_sum` plus `available_days[start + k - 1]` minus `available_days[start - 1]`, where `start` is now `s + 2`.
- `start` is `s + 2`.
- `count` will be incremented by 1 if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true.
- `result` will be updated if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true and `result[k + 1]` is not already updated.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`current_window_sum` is the previous value of `current_window_sum` plus `available_days[start + k - 1]` minus `available_days[start - 1]` with `start` is `s + 2`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true, `result` is updated if `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true and `result[k + 1]` is not already updated.**
