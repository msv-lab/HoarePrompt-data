`current_window_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of `available_days[1:k+1]`. Given the initial state, `available_days[1:k+1]` means `available_days[1:max_day+1]` because `k` is 1 initially. The value of `current_window_sum` is therefore `current_available * max_day` since `available_days[1]` to `available_days[max_day]` are all equal to `current_available`.

Output State: **`current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `day` is `max_day` + 1, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `k` is 2, `count` is 0, `current_window_sum` is `current_available * max_day`**
