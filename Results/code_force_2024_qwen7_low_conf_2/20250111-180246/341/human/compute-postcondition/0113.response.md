Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `l` is `a[n][0]`, `r` is `a[n][1]`, `b[a[n][0]]` is `a[n][1]`, `c[a[n][1]]` is `n + 1`, `d[a[n][0]]` is `n + 1`, `d[a[n][1] + 1]` is `d[n + 2] - (n + 1)`, `vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted.**

### Explanation:
- **Variable `i`:** The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- **Variables `l` and `r`:** For each iteration, `l` is set to `a[i][0]` and `r` is set to `a[i][1]`. Therefore, after the last iteration, `l` is `a[n][0]` and `r` is `a[n][1]`.
- **Variable `b[l]`:** Each `l` is set to `r`, so `b[a[n][0]]` is `a[n][1]`.
- **Variable `c[r]`:** Each `r` increases the count in `c` by 1, and since this happens `n + 1` times, `c[r]` will be `n + 1`.
- **Variable `d[l]` and `d[r + 1]`:** Each `l` increments `d[l]` by 1 and decrements `d[r + 1]` by 1. Since this happens `n + 1` times, `d[l]` will be `n + 1` and `d[r + 1]` will be `d[n + 2] - (n + 1)`.
- **Variable `vc[a[i][0]]`:** It contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n + 1`.
- **Variable `pq`:** It is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted.
- **Variable `a[n]`:** It is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted.
