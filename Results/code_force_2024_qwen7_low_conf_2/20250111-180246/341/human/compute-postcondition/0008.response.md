According to the given code snippet, the loop iterates over each pair `(l, r)` from the `lecturers` list. The loop is about to process the next pair. To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers.
   - `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers.
   - `max_day` is 200,000.
   - `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros, with the value at index `r + 1` equal to -1.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop is about to process the next pair in the `lecturers` list. This means the current pair `(l, r)` has been processed, and the next pair `(l', r')` will be processed in the next iteration.
   - Since the `lecturers` list is being iterated, the `lecturers` list will be reduced by one pair after this iteration.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are as follows:
- The `lecturers` list will now have one fewer pair.
- The `availability` list remains unchanged since the processing of the current pair `(l, r)` does not affect the `availability` list until it reaches the relevant indices.
- `max_day` remains the same as it is a constant value.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers minus 1; `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers with one fewer pair; `max_day` is 200,000; `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros**.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers - 1, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers with one fewer pair, `max_day` is 200,000, `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros**.
