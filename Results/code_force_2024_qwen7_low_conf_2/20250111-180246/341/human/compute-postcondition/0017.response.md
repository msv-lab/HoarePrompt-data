Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]`.
   - `available_days[1]` is `current_available`.
   - `day` is 1.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for day in range(1, max_day + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `day = 1` to `day = max_day`.
   - Each iteration of the loop increments `day` by 1.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `day` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `day` needs to be incremented to 2.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `day` is currently 1, after the next iteration, it will be 2.
   - The other states (`current_available`, `available_days[1]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself (assuming the loop body does not change these values).

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, `day` is 2**
