The code `availability[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value at index `r + 1` in the `availability` list by 1. Given the initial state, the `availability` list is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros (where `max_day` is 200000), meaning initially every element is 0. For each lecturer `(l_i, r_i)` in `lecturers`, the value at index `l_i` in `availability` was incremented by 1.

After the line `availability[r + 1] -= 1` executes, the value at index `r + 1` will be decreased by 1. The values at other indices remain unchanged because no other part of the code modifies them. The `n`, `lecturers`, and `max_day` variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, `max_day` is 200000, `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the value at index `l_i` incremented by 1 for each lecturer except for the value at index `r + 1`, which is now decremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, `max_day` is 200000, `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the value at index `l_i` incremented by 1 for each lecturer except for the value at index `r + 1`, which is now decremented by 1.**
