The code assigns the value 200000 to the variable `max_day`. This does not affect the values of `n` or the contents of the `lecturers` list. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers [(l_i, r_i)], where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, and `max_day` is 200000.**
