`s` is assigned the value of `s + c[i]`. The value of `s` is updated by adding the value of `c[i]` to it. However, the initial values of `s` and `c[i]` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `s` after the operation. But we can say that `s` has been updated.

Output State: **`s` has been updated to `s + c[i]`, `c[i]` remains unchanged**
