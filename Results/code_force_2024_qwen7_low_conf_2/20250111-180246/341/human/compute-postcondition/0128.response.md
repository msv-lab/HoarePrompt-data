Postcondition: **\( n \) is a non-negative integer, \( i \) is 1, \( l = a[n][0] \), \( r = a[n][1] \), \( b[a[n][0]] = a[n][1] \), \( c[a[n][0]] = n + 1 \), \( d[a[n][0]] = n + 1 \), \( d[a[n][1] + 1] = d[n + 2] - (n + 1) \), \( vc[a[i][0]] \) contains all the \( r \) values for each lecturer \( i \) from 1 to \( n + 1 \), \( pq \) is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, \( a[n] \) is the last valid pair inserted into \( a \) if any valid pair was inserted, \( s = s_{initial} - k \) where \( k \) is the number of times \( b[j + (k-1)] \) is True during the loop, \( j \leq m \)**
