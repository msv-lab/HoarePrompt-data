The code sets `available_days[day]` to the value of `current_available`. Given that `day` is 3, this means `available_days[3]` is now equal to `current_available`.

From the initial state:
- `current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]` plus `availability[3]`.
- `available_days[1]` is `current_available`.
- `day` is 3.
- `available_days[3]` is `current_available`.

Since `available_days[day]` (where `day` is 3) is set to `current_available`, and `available_days[3]` was already `current_available`, there is no change in the value of `available_days[3]`. However, `current_available` itself remains unchanged from its initial definition.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]` plus `availability[3]`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, `day` is 3, `available_days[3]` is `current_available`.**
