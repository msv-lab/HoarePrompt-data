Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**:
   - The loop variable is `start`.
   - The loop runs from `2` to `max_day - k + 2`.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`.
   - `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`.
   - `start` is `max_day - k + 2`.
   - `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `result[k + 1]` updated to `count` if `current_window_sum >= k + 1` was true.
   - `count` is incremented by 1 if `current_window_sum >= k + 1`, otherwise `count` remains 0.
   - `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]`.

3. **Determine the Starting Condition**:
   - For the loop to start, `start` must be within the range `[2, max_day - k + 2]`.
   - Since `start` is initially set to `max_day - k + 2`, we need to check if this value is valid for the loop to start.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - The loop will start if `start` is within the specified range.
   - Therefore, `start` must be between `2` and `max_day - k + 2`.

Given the above analysis, the required states to be adjusted are:
- `start` must be within the range `[2, max_day - k + 2]`.

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `start` must be within the range `[2, max_day - k + 2]`, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `result[k + 1]` updated to `count` if `current_window_sum >= k + 1` was true, `count` is incremented by 1 if `current_window_sum >= k + 1`, otherwise `count` remains 0, `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[k + 1]`.**
