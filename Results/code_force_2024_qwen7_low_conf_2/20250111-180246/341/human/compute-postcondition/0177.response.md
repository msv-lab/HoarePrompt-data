Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from standard input, representing the number of potential lecturers, followed by `n` lines of input where each line contains two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the segment of available days for the i-th lecturer. It then calculates the number of ways to select a segment of `k` consecutive days as conference dates for each `k` from 1 to `n`. Finally, it prints these counts to standard output.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following steps:**
1. Reads the number of lecturers `n` and their available day segments `(l_i, r_i)`.
2. Constructs a data structure to efficiently find the earliest end day for any lecturer.
3. Uses a priority queue to maintain the current set of available end days.
4. Counts the number of valid segments for each possible conference date length from 1 to `n`.
5. Prints the counts of valid segments for each possible conference date length.

**Edge Cases:**
- If no valid segments are found, the function will still proceed but the counts for all lengths will be zero.
- The function handles the maximum input size of `2Â·10^5` lecturers and their available days appropriately without crashing.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly handle cases where `l_i` and `r_i` are equal, though it implicitly handles such cases since the counting mechanism is based on ranges.
