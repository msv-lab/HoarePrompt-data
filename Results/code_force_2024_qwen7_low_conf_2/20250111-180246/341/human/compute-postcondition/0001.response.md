The code initializes a list `availability` with length `max_day + 2` and fills it with zeros. This means that for each day from 0 to `max_day + 1`, the availability is set to 0. The values of `n`, `lecturers`, and `max_day` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers [(l_i, r_i)], where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, `max_day` is 200000, and `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros.**
