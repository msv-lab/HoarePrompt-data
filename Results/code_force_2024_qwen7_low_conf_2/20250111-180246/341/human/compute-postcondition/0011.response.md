Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer, `max_day` is 200,000, and `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` integers. For each lecturer `(l_i, r_i)`, the value at index `l_i` in `availability` is incremented by 1, and the value at index `r + 1` is decremented by 1. After all iterations, the value at any index `d` in `availability` (where `1 <= d <= max_day`) represents the total number of lecturers available on day `d`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each lecturer's availability range and increments the count of availability on the start day (`l_i`) and decrements the count on the next day (`r + 1`).
- After all iterations, the `availability` list will reflect the cumulative availability of all lecturers across the specified range of days.
- The `max_day` value remains unchanged and is set to 200,000.
- The `lecturers` list remains intact and represents the original ranges of availability for each lecturer.
- The `n` value remains the same, indicating the total number of lecturers considered.
