`j` is decremented by 1. The original value of `j` was `j - 1`, and `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`. After decrementing `j` by 1, `j` will be `j - 2`. The condition `s < j - i` remains valid, as `s` must still be less than `j - i`, which is now `(j - 1) - i`.

Output State: **`j` is `j - 2`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and `s` must be less than `j - i`.**
