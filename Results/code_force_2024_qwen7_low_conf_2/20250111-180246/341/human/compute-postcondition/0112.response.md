Step-by-step analysis:

1. Initial State:
   - `i` is 3
   - `l` is `a[3][0]`
   - `r` is `a[3][1]`
   - `b[a[3][0]]` is `a[3][1]`
   - `c[a[2][1]]` is increased by 1
   - `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1
   - `d[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1
   - `d[a[2][1] + 1]` is decremented by 1
   - `c[r]` is increased by 1
   - `d[a[3][0]]` is increased by 1

2. Code Execution:
   - The code `d[r + 1] -= 1` decreases the value of `d[r + 1]` by 1.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - `d[r + 1]` is updated from its initial value (which was `d[a[2][1] + 1]` before) to `d[a[2][1] + 1] - 1`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3; `l` is `a[3][0]`; `r` is `a[3][1]`; `b[a[3][0]]` is `a[3][1]`; `c[a[2][1]]` is increased by 1; `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][1] + 1]` is decreased by 1; `c[r]` is increased by 1; `d[a[3][0]]` is increased by 1; `d[r + 1]` is `d[a[2][1] + 1] - 1`.**
