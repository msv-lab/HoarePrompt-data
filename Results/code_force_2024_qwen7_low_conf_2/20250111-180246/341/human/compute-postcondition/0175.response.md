Output State: **`i` is `nnn + 1`, `i` is greater than `nnn`.**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `k + 2`.
   - `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `nnn + 1`.
   - Each iteration increments `i` by `1`.

3. **Iteration Analysis**:
   - After the first iteration (`i = 2`), `i` is `k + 3`.
   - After the second iteration (`i = 3`), `i` is `k + 4`.
   - This pattern continues until `i` reaches `nnn + 1`.

4. **Final Iteration**:
   - When `i` reaches `nnn + 1`, the loop condition `i <= nnn` fails.
   - At this point, `i` is exactly `nnn + 1`.

5. **Post-Loop State**:
   - Since the loop stops when `i` exceeds `nnn`, the final value of `i` is `nnn + 1`.
   - `i` is now greater than `nnn`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state is:
- `i` is `nnn + 1`.
- `i` is greater than `nnn`.

This is the state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.
