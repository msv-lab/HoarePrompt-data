Postcondition: ***`result[k+1]` is 0, `count` is either 3 or 4, `current_window_sum` is the old value of `current_window_sum` plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`, and `start` is `start + 1`. If `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `count` is either 3 or 4; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged as there is no else part in the code.***
