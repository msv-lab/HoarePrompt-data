Let's break down the requirements for the loop to execute step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Variable**: The loop variable is `day`, which iterates from 1 to `max_day + 1`.
2. **Determine the Range of `day`**: The loop will start if `day` is in the range from 1 to `max_day + 1`. Given that `max_day` is 200,000, the loop will start when `day` is between 1 and 200,001 (inclusive).
3. **Check the Initial Value of `day`**: The initial value of `day` should be 1 for the loop to start executing its first iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The values of `n`, `lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, and `available_days` do not directly affect the execution of the loop itself. However, their initial values might be relevant to the loop body, but they are not required for the loop to start executing.

Based on this analysis:

- The loop will execute if `day` is 1.
- Since `max_day` is fixed at 200,000, we only need to ensure that `day` starts at 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`day` is 1, `max_day` is 200,000, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers, `availability` is a list of 200,002 integers, `current_available` is 0, and `available_days` is a list of 200,001 zeros**. 

However, since `max_day` and the lists (`lecturers`, `availability`, `current_available`, `available_days`) do not directly control the loop's execution, we focus on the initial value of `day`.

Final State: **`day` is 1**
