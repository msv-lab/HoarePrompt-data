Postcondition: **`current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `start` must be within the range `[2, max_day - k + 2]`, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `result[k + 1]` is updated to `count` if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `current_window_sum` is now the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[start]`, and the condition `(current_window_sum >= k)` is checked. If `(current_window_sum >= k)` is true, `current_window_sum` is updated to the sum of `available_days[1]` through `available_days[start]`. If `(current_window_sum >= k)` is false, no changes are made to `result[k + 1]`, `count`, or `current_window_sum`.**
