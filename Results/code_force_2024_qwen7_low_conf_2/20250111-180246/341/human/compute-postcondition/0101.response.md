Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is `a[1][0]`.
   - `r` is `a[1][1]`.
   - `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`.
   - `c[a[1][1]]` is increased by 1.
   - `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1.
   - `d[a[1][1] + 1]` is decreased by 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to become 2 for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i` should now be 2.

4. **Adjust Other States:**
   - The values of `l` and `r` depend on `a[1][0]` and `a[1][1]`, which remain unchanged.
   - The assignment `b[a[1][0]] = a[1][1]` remains the same.
   - The increments `c[a[1][1]]` and `d[a[1][0]]` also remain the same.
   - The decrement `d[a[1][1] + 1]` remains the same.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is `a[1][0]`.
   - `r` is `a[1][1]`.
   - `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`.
   - `c[a[1][1]]` is increased by 1.
   - `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1.
   - `d[a[1][1] + 1]` is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `l` is `a[1][0]`, `r` is `a[1][1]`, `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`, `c[a[1][1]]` is increased by 1, `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1, `d[a[1][1] + 1]` is decreased by 1**.
