`count` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the `current_available`, `available_days`, `start`, `result`, `current_window_sum`, and `count` remain in their original states.

Output State: **`current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `start` is `max_day`, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `count` is `count + 1`, `current_window_sum` is `current_window_sum`.**
