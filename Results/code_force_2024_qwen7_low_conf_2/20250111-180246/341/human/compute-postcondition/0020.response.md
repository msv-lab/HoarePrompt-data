Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]`.
   - `available_days[1]` is `current_available`.
   - `day` is 2.
   - `available_days[2]` is `current_available`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for day in range(1, max_day + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `day = 1` to `day = max_day`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `day` is 2.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `day` must be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3 (assuming `max_day` is at least 3).
   - The `current_available` value remains unchanged as it is not directly modified within the loop.
   - The `available_days` array will be updated based on the new value of `day`.

5. **New State:**
   - `current_available` remains the same.
   - `available_days[2]` remains the same.
   - `day` will be 3.
   - `available_days[3]` will be updated to `current_available`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, `day` is 3, `available_days[3]` is `current_available**.
