Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State: `i` is 2; `l` is `a[2][0]`; `r` is `a[2][1]`; `b[a[2][0]]` is `a[2][1]`; `c[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
d[r + 1] -= 1
```

Here, `r` is `a[2][1]`. Let's denote `a[2][0]` as `x` and `a[2][1]` as `y`. From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is `x`
- `r` is `y`
- `b[x]` is `y`
- `c[y]` is incremented by 1
- `d[x]` is incremented by 1

So, `d[r + 1]` is equivalent to `d[y + 1]`. The code decrements the value of `d[y + 1]` by 1.

After executing the code:
- `i` remains 2
- `l` remains `a[2][0]` (which is `x`)
- `r` remains `a[2][1]` (which is `y`)
- `b[x]` remains `y`
- `c[y]` is incremented by 1 (value is `c[y] + 1`)
- `d[x]` is incremented by 1 (value is `d[x] + 1`)
- `d[y + 1]` is decremented by 1

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` is `a[2][0]`; `r` is `a[2][1]`; `b[a[2][0]]` is `a[2][1]`; `c[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][1] + 1]` is decremented by 1**
