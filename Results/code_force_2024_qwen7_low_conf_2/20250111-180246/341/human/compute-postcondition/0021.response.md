`current_available` is updated by adding the value of `availability[day]`. Given that `day` is 3, `current_available` was initially its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, and `available_days[3]` is `current_available`. So, `current_available` is now its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]` plus `availability[3]`.

Output State: **`current_available` is its original value plus `availability[1]` plus `availability[2]` plus `availability[3]`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, `day` is 3, `available_days[3]` is `current_available`**
