`j` is decremented by 1. The value of `j` was previously such that `ans[j]` was incremented by 1, and other variables were set according to their respective initial conditions. Since `j` is decremented by 1, the value of `j` now is the previous value of `j` minus 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans[j-1]` is incremented by 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2, `l = a[n][0]`, `r = a[n][1]`, `b[a[n][0]] = a[n][1]`, `c[a[n][0]] = n + 1`, `d[a[n][0]] = n + 1`, `d[a[n][1] + 1] = d[n + 2] - (n + 1)`, `vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted, `s` is `s_{\text{initial}} - k + c[1] - 1` if `b[j]` is True, otherwise `s` is `s_{\text{initial}} - k + c[1]`.**
