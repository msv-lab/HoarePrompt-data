According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `nnn + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `print(ans[i])` has been executed, meaning that `i` was incremented (or the loop has just started with `i = 1`).

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Value of `i`:** Since `print(ans[i])` was executed, `i` must be equal to the current value of `i` plus one if it's the next iteration, or `i` would be set to 1 if this is the first iteration.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:** The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `nnn + 1`.

Given that `print(ans[i])` was just executed, the new value of `i` will be either `i + 1` (if it's not the first iteration) or `1` (if it's the first iteration). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be within the range of 1 to `nnn + 1`.

Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` will be `k + 1`.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we generalize the answer based on the condition that `i` must still be within the valid range.

State: **`i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.**
