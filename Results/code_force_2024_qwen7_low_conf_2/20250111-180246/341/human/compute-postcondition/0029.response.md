`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `day`, `result`, `k`, `current_available`, and `current_window_sum` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `day` is `max_day` + 1, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `k` is 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `current_window_sum` is `current_available * max_day`.

Output State: **`current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `day` is `max_day` + 1, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `k` is 2, `count` is `count + 1`, `current_window_sum` is `current_available * max_day`.**
