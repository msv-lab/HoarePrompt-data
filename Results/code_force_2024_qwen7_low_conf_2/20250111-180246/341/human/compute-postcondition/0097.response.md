`b[l]` is assigned the value of `r`. Given that `l` is `a[1][0]` and `r` is `a[1][1]`, this means `b[a[1][0]] = a[1][1]`.

The initial state is updated as follows:
- `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
- `l` remains unchanged and is still `a[1][0]`.
- `r` remains unchanged and is still `a[1][1]`.
- A new assignment is made to `b[l]` which is `a[1][1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is 1, `l` is `a[1][0]`, `r` is `a[1][1]`, `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`**.
