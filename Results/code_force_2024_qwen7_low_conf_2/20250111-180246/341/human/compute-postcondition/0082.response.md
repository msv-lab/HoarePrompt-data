`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was either 2 or 3, so after incrementing, the new value of `count` will be 3 or 4 respectively. The other variables (`result[k+1]`, `current_window_sum`, `start`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`result[k+1]` is 0, `count` is either 3 or 4, `current_window_sum` is the old value of `current_window_sum` plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1], start is `start + 1`**
