The code `print(ans[i])` prints the value of `ans[i]`. However, no new variables are assigned, and no changes are made to existing variables other than printing the value of `ans[i]`. The initial state remains unchanged except for the action of printing.

Output State: **`print(ans[i])` is executed and the value of `ans[i]` is printed.**
