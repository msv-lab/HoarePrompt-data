Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers`, a list of pairs of integers where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer. It processes this data to determine the number of valid windows of consecutive days where the sum of the number of available lecturers is at least the window size `k`. The function first constructs an `availability` array to count the number of lecturers available on each day. Then, it calculates the cumulative availability for each day. Finally, it iterates through possible window sizes from 1 to `n` and counts the number of valid windows for each size, storing these counts in the `result` list. The function returns a list of `n` integers, where each element indicates the number of valid windows found for the corresponding window size `k` (from 1 to `n`). The function handles edge cases such as when no lecturers are available on any day, and it ensures that the result is only returned for valid window sizes up to `n`.**
