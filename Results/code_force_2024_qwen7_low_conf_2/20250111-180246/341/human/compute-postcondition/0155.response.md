Initial State: 
- \( j \geq i \)
- \( s < j - i + 1 \)
- \( j \) is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

Code Snippet:
```python
s -= 1 if b[j] else 0
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the Impact of the Code:**
   - The code updates \( s \) by subtracting 1 if \( b[j] \) is `False`, otherwise \( s \) remains unchanged.
   
2. **Update the Value of \( s \):**
   - If \( b[j] \) is `False`, then \( s \) is decremented by 1.
   - If \( b[j] \) is `True`, then \( s \) remains the same.
   
3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The previous state required \( j \geq i \) and \( s < j - i + 1 \).
   - After updating \( s \), the new condition for \( s \) is \( s < j - i \) because \( j \) is now \( j - 1 \).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- \( j = j - 1 \)
- \( j \geq i \) (since \( j \) is decreased by 1, this condition is still satisfied if \( j \geq i \))
- \( s < j - i \)

Output State: **`j` is `j - 1`, `j` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and `s` must be less than `j - i`.**
