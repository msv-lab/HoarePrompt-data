`j` is decremented by 1, but the specific value of `j` is not given. The value of `s` and other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is `s + c[i] - 1` if `b[j]` is `False` and `s + c[i]` is less than `j - i + 1`, otherwise `s` is `s + c[i]` and `s + c[i]` is less than `j - i + 1`; `j` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is `s + c[i] - 1` if `b[j]` is `False` and `s + c[i]` is less than `j - i + 1`, otherwise `s` is `s + c[i]` and `s + c[i]` is less than `j - i + 1`; `j` is decreased by 1.**
