Postcondition: ***`current_available` is the sum of all `availability[day]` for `day` from 1 to `max_day`, `available_days[1]` is `current_available`, ..., `available_days[max_day]` is `current_available`, `start` is `max_day - 1`, `result` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `count` is `count + 2`, `current_window_sum` is `current_available * max_day`, if `current_window_sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `count` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
