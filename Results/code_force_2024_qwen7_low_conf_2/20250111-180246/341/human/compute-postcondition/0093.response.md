Postcondition: ***`vc[2][i]` is assigned to `a[n]`; `n` is incremented by 1; `pq` is an empty priority queue; an `IndexError` is raised due to `heapq.heappop(pq)` on an empty queue.*** 

Explanation: Since the if part and the else part do not provide additional states beyond the initial states and the operation within the if part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition within the if part. The else part does not introduce any new conditions, so it does not affect the overall postcondition.
