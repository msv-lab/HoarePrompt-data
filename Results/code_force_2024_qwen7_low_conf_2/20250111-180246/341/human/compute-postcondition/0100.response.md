Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `i` is 1
  - `l` is `a[1][0]`
  - `r` is `a[1][1]`
  - `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`
  - `c[a[1][1]]` is increased by 1
  - `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  d[r + 1] -= 1
  ```

- Impact Analysis:
  - `r` is initially `a[1][1]`.
  - The line `d[r + 1] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `d[r + 1]`, where `r` is `a[1][1]`.

Since the initial value of `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1 (which means `d[a[1][1] + 1]` was incremented by 1), after executing the line `d[r + 1] -= 1`, the value of `d[r + 1]` will be decreased by 1.

So, `d[a[1][1] + 1]` will be decremented by 1.

- Updated Values:
  - `i` remains 1.
  - `l` remains `a[1][0]`.
  - `r` remains `a[1][1]`.
  - `b[a[1][0]]` remains `a[1][1]`.
  - `c[a[1][1]]` remains increased by 1.
  - `d[a[1][0]]` remains increased by 1.
  - `d[a[1][1] + 1]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is `a[1][0]`, `r` is `a[1][1]`, `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`, `c[a[1][1]]` is increased by 1, `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1, `d[a[1][1] + 1]` is decreased by 1.**
