To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `result[k+1]` is 0
   - `count` is either 2 or 3
   - `current_window_sum` is the sum of `available_days[1:k + 1]` plus the difference between `available_days[start + k - 1]` and `available_days[start - 1]`
   - `start` must be in the range [3, max_day - k + 2]

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `start` from 2 to `max_day - k + 2`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to continue, `start` must increment by 1.
   - The new value of `start` would be `start + 1`.

4. **Updating States:**
   - Since `start` is increasing by 1, the new value of `start` will be `start + 1`.
   - `current_window_sum` will be recalculated for the new `start` value.

5. **Checking Constraints:**
   - The new `start` value must still satisfy the condition: `3 ≤ start + 1 ≤ max_day - k + 2`.
     - Simplifying this, we get: `2 ≤ start ≤ max_day - k + 1`.

Given these points, the key changes needed for the next iteration are:

- Increase `start` by 1.
- Recalculate `current_window_sum` for the new `start` value.
- Ensure the new `start` value satisfies the range constraint.

Since the other states (`result[k+1]`, `count`, and `current_window_sum`) are dependent on the loop body execution and not directly affected by the increment of `start`, they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`result[k+1]` is 0, `count` is either 2 or 3, `current_window_sum` is recalculated for the new `start` value, `start` is `start + 1` and must be in the range [3, max_day - k + 2]**.

For simplicity, if we assume no change in `count` or `current_window_sum` without additional context from the loop body, the state can be summarized as:

State: **`result[k+1]` is 0, `count` is either 2 or 3, `current_window_sum` is recalculated, `start` is `start + 1`**.
