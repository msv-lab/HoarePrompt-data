`d[l]` is assigned the value of `d[l] + 1`. Given that `l` is `a[1][0]`, this means `d[a[1][0]]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is `a[1][0]`, `r` is `a[1][1]`, `b[a[1][0]]` is `a[1][1]`, `c[a[1][1]]` is increased by 1, `d[a[1][0]]` is increased by 1**.
