The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `a[n]` and removes the smallest element from `pq` using `heapq.heappop(pq)`. However, the initial state indicates that `pq` is an empty priority queue, meaning there is nothing to pop from it. Thus, `heapq.heappop(pq)` will raise an `IndexError` and terminate the execution. 

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output state should reflect the changes made to the variables `a[n]` and `n` while noting that an error occurs due to the empty `pq`.

Output State: **`vc[2][i]` is assigned to `a[n]`; `n` is incremented by 1; `pq` is an empty priority queue; an `IndexError` is raised due to `heapq.heappop(pq)` on an empty queue.**
