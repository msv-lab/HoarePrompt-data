The code `availability[r + 1] -= 1` decrements the value of `availability[r + 1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `r` is an index within the range of the list `lecturers`, and `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros.

Since the exact value of `r` is not specified, the only change is in the `availability` list at the position `r + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers - 1, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers with one fewer pair, `max_day` is 200,000, `availability` is a list of 200,002 zeros where `availability[r + 1]` is now decreased by 1.**
