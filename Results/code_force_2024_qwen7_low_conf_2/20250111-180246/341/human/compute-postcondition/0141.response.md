The value of `j` is decremented by 1. The initial state is `j` is `original_j - 1` and `original_j` must be greater than 12. After decrementing, `j` becomes `original_j - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 2, `j` is `original_j - 2`, `original_j` must be greater than 12, `n` is a non-negative integer, `l = a[n][0]`, `r = a[n][1]`, `b[a[n][0]] = a[n][1]`, `c[a[n][0]] = n + 1`, `c[a[n][1]] = n + 1`, `d[a[n][0]] = n + 1`, `d[a[n][1] + 1] = d[n + 2] - (n + 1)`, `vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted, `s` is 8 if `b[j]` is True or 9 if `b[j]` is False.**
