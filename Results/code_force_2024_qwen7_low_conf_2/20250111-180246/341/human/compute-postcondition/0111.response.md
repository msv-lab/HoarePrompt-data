The code `d[l] += 1` increments the value of `d[l]` by 1. From the initial state, we know that `l` is `a[3][0]`. Therefore, the value of `d[a[3][0]]` is incremented by 1.

The initial values are:
- `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1
- `d[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1
- `d[a[2][1] + 1]` is decremented by 1
- `c[r]` is increased by 1

Since `l` is `a[3][0]`, the only relevant change from the initial state is to `d[l]`. All other values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `l` is `a[3][0]`; `r` is `a[3][1]`; `b[a[3][0]]` is `a[3][1]`; `c[a[2][1]]` is increased by 1; `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][1] + 1]` is decremented by 1; `c[r]` is increased by 1; `d[a[3][0]]` is increased by 1**
