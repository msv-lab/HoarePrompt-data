`j` is decremented by 1, which means the value of `j` changes but the condition \( s < j - i + 1 \) and \( j \geq i \) needs to be checked to see if it still holds true. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `s`, `i`, and `b`, we only know that the condition must still hold true after decrementing `j`. Therefore, the updated state is that `j` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is equal to \( s - 1 \) if `b[j]` is `False`, otherwise `s` remains the same; \( s < j - i + 1 \) and \( j \geq i \), and `j` is decreased by 1.**
