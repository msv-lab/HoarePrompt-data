Output State: **`vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `n` is the number of valid pairs inserted into `a`, `i` is `m` (the upper limit of the outer loop), `m` is the number of iterations of the outer loop, `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, and `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted.**
