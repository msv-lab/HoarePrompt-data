The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it processes input from standard input where the first line contains an integer `n` representing the number of potential lecturers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5). Each of the next `n` lines contains two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ 2·10^5) representing the segment of available days for the i-th lecturer. The output is printed to standard output, consisting of `n` integers where the `k`-th number denotes the number of ways to select a segment of `k` consecutive days as conference dates.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the input from standard input, which includes the number of lecturers and their available days, and then print to standard output the number of ways to select segments of consecutive days for each lecturer.
