`d[l]` is incremented by 1. From the initial state, we know `l` is `a[2][0]`. Therefore, `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` is `a[2][0]`; `r` is `a[2][1]`; `b[a[2][0]]` is `a[2][1]`; `c[a[2][1]]` is incremented by 1; `d[a[2][0]]` is incremented by 1**
