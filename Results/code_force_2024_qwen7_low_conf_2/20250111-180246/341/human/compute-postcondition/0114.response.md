`s` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n + 1`, `l` is `a[n][0]`, `r` is `a[n][1]`, `b[a[n][0]]` is `a[n][1]`, `c[a[n][1]]` is `n + 1`, `d[a[n][0]]` is `n + 1`, `d[a[n][1] + 1]` is `d[n + 2] - (n + 1)`, `vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted, `s` is `0`.
