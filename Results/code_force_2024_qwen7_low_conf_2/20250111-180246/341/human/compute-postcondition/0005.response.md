To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers.
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers where each pair \((l, r)\) represents the range of available days for the \(i\)-th lecturer.
- `max_day` is 200,000.
- `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros. For each lecturer, the value at index \(l_i\) is incremented by 1, and the value at index \(r + 1\) is decremented by 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for (l, r) in lecturers:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each pair \((l, r)\) in the `lecturers` list.
2. **Effect of Each Iteration**:
   - For each pair \((l, r)\), the value at index \(l\) in the `availability` list is incremented by 1.
   - For each pair \((l, r)\), the value at index \(r + 1\) in the `availability` list is decremented by 1.

### State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers.
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers.
- `max_day` is 200,000.
- `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the values at indices \(l_i\) and \(r + 1\) adjusted based on the previous iterations.

### Adjusting the States for Next Iteration:
- Since the loop will execute again if there are more pairs in the `lecturers` list, we need to ensure that the loop can continue.
- At the end of the previous iteration, the current lecturer's availability range \((l, r)\) has been processed, so the next lecturer's range will be considered.

### New State:
- `n` remains unchanged as it represents the total number of lecturers.
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers, but the specific pair \((l, r)\) from the previous iteration is no longer being considered.
- `max_day` remains 200,000.
- `availability` will have updated values based on the next lecturer's range \((l, r)\).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to reflect the next lecturer's availability range being considered. 

**State:**
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers.
- `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers, and the loop is about to process the next pair.
- `max_day` is 200,000.
- `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the values at indices \(l_{next}\) and \(r_{next} + 1\) adjusted based on the next lecturer's range \((l_{next}, r_{next})\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers and the loop is about to process the next pair, `max_day` is 200,000, `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the values at indices \(l_{next}\) and \(r_{next} + 1\) adjusted based on the next lecturer's range \((l_{next}, r_{next})\)**.
