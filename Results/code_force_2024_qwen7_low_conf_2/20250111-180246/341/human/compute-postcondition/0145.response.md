Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `ans[0]` is 1, `ans[j+1]` is incremented by `m`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `l = a[n][0]`, `r = a[n][1]`, `b[a[n][0]] = a[n][1]`, `c[a[n][0]] = n + 1`, `c[a[n][1]] = n + 1`, `d[a[n][0]] = n + 1`, `d[a[n][1] + 1] = d[n + 2] - (n + 1)`, `vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted, `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted. If `j <= m`, `ans[j+1]` is further incremented by `m`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
