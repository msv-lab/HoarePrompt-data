The code snippet `print(ans[i])` does not change the value of any variables. It only prints the value of `ans[i]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`. The value of `ans[i]` is printed.**
