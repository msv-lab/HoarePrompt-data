The code `l, r = a[i]` assigns the elements from the list `a` at index `i` to the variables `l` and `r`. Given that `i` is 1 and `i` must be less than `n + 1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and the values of `l` and `r` are set to the elements in the list `a` at index 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` is `a[1][0]`, `r` is `a[1][1]`**
