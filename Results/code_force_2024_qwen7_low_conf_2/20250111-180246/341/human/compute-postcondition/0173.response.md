Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` from the previous iteration.
   - `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.
   - The value of `ans[i]` is printed.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `nnn + 1`. 

3. **Current Value of `i`**: From the initial state, we know `i` is currently `k + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, the next value of `i` must satisfy the loop condition. Since the loop increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `k + 2`.

5. **Condition Check**: We need to ensure that `k + 2` is still within the range `[1, nnn + 1]`. This means `k + 2` should be less than or equal to `nnn`.

6. **State Adjustment**: 
   - `i` will be `k + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The condition `i <= nnn` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- The condition `i <= nnn` must still be true.

Since the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration was `k + 1`, the new state for the next iteration is:
- `i` is `k + 2`.
- `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.

The final state is:
State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`**.
