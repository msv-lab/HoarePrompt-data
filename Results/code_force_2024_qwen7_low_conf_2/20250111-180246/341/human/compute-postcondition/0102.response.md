The code snippet updates the values of `l` and `r` by assigning them the values from `a[i]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- Initially, `i` is 2.
- `l` is `a[1][0]`.
- `r` is `a[1][1]`.

When the code runs, `l` and `r` are updated to the values of `a[i][0]` and `a[i][1]` respectively. Since `i` is 2, the new values of `l` and `r` are `a[2][0]` and `a[2][1]`.

The states of other variables (`b`, `c`, `d`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 2; `l` is `a[2][0]`; `r` is `a[2][1]`**
