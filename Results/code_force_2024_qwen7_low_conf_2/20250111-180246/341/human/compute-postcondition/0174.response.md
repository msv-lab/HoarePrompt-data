The code `print(ans[i])` prints the value of `ans[i]` but does not change the value of any variables. The only variable that could potentially be accessed or changed in this line of code is `i`, but since no assignment operation is performed on `i`, its value remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`

Since the code does not modify the value of `i`, the value of `i` remains `k + 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`i` is `k + 2`, `i` must be less than or equal to `nnn`.**
