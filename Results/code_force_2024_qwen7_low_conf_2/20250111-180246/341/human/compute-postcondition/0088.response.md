The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers, and `lecturers`, which is a list of pairs of integers [(l_i, r_i)], where each pair represents the range of available days for the i-th lecturer. The function returns a list of `n` integers where each `result[k]` (for `k` from 1 to `n`) is the number of valid windows found where the sum of `available_days[start:start+k]` is at least `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `lecturers` (a list of pairs of integers), and returns a list of `n` integers where each element indicates the number of valid windows with a sum of available days meeting the specified condition.**
