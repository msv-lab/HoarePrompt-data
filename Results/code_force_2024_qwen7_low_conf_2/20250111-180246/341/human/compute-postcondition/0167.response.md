`ans[i]` is incremented by `ans[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `max(m, n) - 2`, the value of `i` does not change. The value of `ans[i]` is updated to its current value plus `ans[i + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `max(m, n) - 2`, `j` is `m`, `s` is unchanged, `ans[0]` is incremented by 1, `ans[j - i + 1]` is incremented by `m`, `n` is unchanged, `l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `d` is unchanged, `vc` is unchanged, `ans[i]` is now `ans[i] + ans[i + 1]`, `pq` is unchanged, `a[n]` is unchanged unless a valid pair was inserted**
