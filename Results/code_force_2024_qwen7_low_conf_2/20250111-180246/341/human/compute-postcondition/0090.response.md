Postcondition: ***`vc[2]` is a non-empty list, `i` is the index of the last element in `vc[2]`, `j` is the new last element of `vc[2]` (which is the largest element of `vc[2]` after all smallest elements are removed), `pq` is an empty priority queue since all elements have been removed from it, and `m` is the same as its initial value. The condition `(pq)` is false since `pq` is an empty priority queue.***
