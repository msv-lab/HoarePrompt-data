The code `availability[l] += 1` increments the value at index `l` of the `availability` list by 1. Here, `l` is `l_next`, which is part of the current lecturer's range \((l_{next}, r_{next})\).

- The value of `n` (the number of potential lecturers) remains unchanged.
- The `lecturers` list remains unchanged because only one lecturer's range is being processed here.
- `max_day` remains unchanged.
- The `availability` list has its value at index `l_next` incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of potential lecturers; `lecturers` is a list of pairs of integers and the loop is about to process the next pair; `max_day` is 200,000; `availability` is a list of `max_day + 2` zeros with the value at index `l_next` incremented by 1.**
