Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
1. `vc[a[i][0]]` contains all the `r` values for each lecturer `i` from 1 to `n+1`.
2. `n` is the number of valid pairs inserted into `a`.
3. `i` is `m` (the upper limit of the outer loop).
4. `m` is the number of iterations of the outer loop.
5. `pq` is an empty priority queue if no valid pair was inserted or remains non-empty if at least one valid pair was inserted.
6. `a[n]` is the last valid pair inserted into `a` if any valid pair was inserted.

### Loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is at least 1 to start the loop.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - Hence, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the condition `i < n + 1` will hold true as long as `i` does not exceed `n`.
   - We need to ensure that the loop will eventually terminate, which means `i` should not become greater than or equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `vc[a[i][0]]`: This variable does not directly affect the loop condition but might be used inside the loop.
   - `n`: This is a fixed value and does not change within the loop.
   - `m`: This is the upper limit of the outer loop and is not directly relevant to the inner loop's condition.
   - `pq`: Whether the priority queue is empty or not does not directly affect the loop's continuation.
   - `a[n]`: This variable is used to store the last valid pair and does not directly affect the loop condition.

### Conclusion:

The key adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is initialized correctly and that the loop will eventually terminate. The critical state adjustments are:

- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `i` should not exceed `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `n + 1`**.
