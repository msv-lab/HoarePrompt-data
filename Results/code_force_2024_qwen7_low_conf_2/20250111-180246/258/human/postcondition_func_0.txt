The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). If `x` is 1, it returns the list `[1]`. Otherwise, it constructs a list `a` where the first element is `1`, followed by `-1` repeated `n-2` times, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the last bit), and returns this list `a`.
