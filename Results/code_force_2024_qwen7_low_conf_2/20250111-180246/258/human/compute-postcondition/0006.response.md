The code `bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` to the list `bits`. The value of `bit` is either 0 or 1, but since it is not specified what the exact value of `bit` is, we can keep it as `bit`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) and \(x\) is not equal to 1; `bits` is a list containing one element which is either 0 or 1; `bit` is either 0 or 1.**
