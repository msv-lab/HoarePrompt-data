Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`. This means the loop will execute from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Loop Variables**:
   - `i` starts at 0.
   - `n` is an unspecified variable but determines the number of iterations.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be a non-negative integer (i.e., `n` must be at least 1).

4. **Other Relevant Variables**:
   - `x` is initially 0.
   - `bits` is a list containing one element, `[0]`.
   - `a` is a list containing one element, `[0]`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The initial values of `x`, `bits`, and `a` do not directly affect the loop condition but might be relevant for other parts of the program logic.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is [0], `a` is [0], `n` must be greater than 0**
