Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). If `x` is 1, it returns the list `[1]`. Otherwise, it constructs a list `a` where the first element is `1`, followed by `-1` repeated `n-2` times, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the last bit), and returns this list `a`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `x` is 1, the function returns `[1]`.
- If `x` is 2, the function returns `[1, -1]`.
- For any other positive integer `x`, the function returns `[1, -1, -1, ..., -1]` with `n-2` `-1`s, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the last bit).

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotations suggest that after the loop, `bits` should contain the binary representation of `x` in reverse order. However, the code does not explicitly reverse the `bits` list before constructing the `a` list. Therefore, the `bits` list will contain the binary representation of `x` in its original order, which does not affect the final output since the `a` list is constructed based on the presence of `1`s and `0`s in `bits`, not their order.
