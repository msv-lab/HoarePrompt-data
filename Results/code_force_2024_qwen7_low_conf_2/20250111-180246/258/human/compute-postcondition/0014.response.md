`bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` to the list `bits`. Since `bit` is already defined as `x & 1`, and `bits` initially contains only `[bit]`, after appending, `bits` will be `[bit, bit]`. The values of `x` and `bit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `x // 4` and greater than 0; `bit` is `x & 1`; `bits` is `[bit, bit]`**
