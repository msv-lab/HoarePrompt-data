`bits.append(bit)` appends the value of `bit` to the list `bits`. Given the initial state where `x` is `x // 2` (meaning `x` is now half of its original value, and it must be greater than 0) and `bit` is `x & 1` (meaning `bit` is the least significant bit of `x`), the code appends this `bit` value to the `bits` list. However, since `bits` is not defined in the initial state, it will be initialized as a list containing the `bit` value. The values of `x` and `bit` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is `x // 2` and greater than 0; `bit` is `x & 1`; `bits` is a list containing one element, which is `bit`**
