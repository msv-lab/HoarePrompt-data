According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is `x // 4` and greater than 0.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must still be greater than 0 after the next iteration. Given that `x` is updated by `x // 4` in each iteration, we need to ensure that after the next division, `x` remains greater than 0.

Since `x` is currently `x // 4` and greater than 0, dividing it by 4 again will result in `x // 16` (or some smaller integer) still being greater than 0. Therefore, no further adjustment to the state is necessary as long as `x` remains positive after the division.

Thus, the state at the end of the current iteration should remain the same for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`x` is `x // 4` and greater than 0; `bit` is `x & 1`; `bits` is a list containing one element, which is `bit`**
