First, let's examine the initial state:
- `x` is 0
- `bits` is `[0, True]`
- `a` is `[1, -1]`
- `i` is an unspecified index.

The code snippet is `a[i + 1] = -1`.

Given the initial state, `bits[0]` is `False` and `bits[1]` is `True`. Since `bits[i]` is `True`, the program will continue execution with `bits[i]` being `True`. This means `i` must be `1`.

Now, substituting `i` with `1`, the code becomes `a[1 + 1] = -1`, which simplifies to `a[2] = -1`.

Since `a` initially is `[1, -1]`, adding another element `a[2]` with the value `-1` results in `a` being `[1, -1, -1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `x` remains `0`
- `bits` remains `[0, True]`
- `a` becomes `[1, -1, -1]`
- `i` remains `1`

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is [0, True], `a` is [1, -1, -1], `i` is 1**
