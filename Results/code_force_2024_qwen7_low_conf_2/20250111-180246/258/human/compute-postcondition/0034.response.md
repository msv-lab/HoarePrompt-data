The code `a[i + 1] = -1` updates the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a` to `-1`. From the initial state, we know that `bits[0]` is `True`, which means `a[0]` was updated from `-1` to `1`. Therefore, `i` is `0`, and the element at index `1` (which is `i + 1`) will be updated to `-1`.

After executing the code, the list `a` will be `[1, -1, 1]` because the only change is at index `1`.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` remains [0, True], `a` is [1, -1, 1]**
