Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` in reverse order.** 

Explanation:
- The loop continues to shift `x` right by 1 bit until `x` becomes 0.
- During each iteration, the least significant bit of `x` is appended to the `bits` list.
- After the loop finishes, `x` will be 0 because the right shift operation eventually reduces `x` to 0.
- The `bits` list contains all the bits of the original value of `x` in reverse order (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).

Since `x` is a positive integer and initially \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\), the length of the `bits` list will be \(\lceil \log_2(x+1) \rceil\), which is the number of bits required to represent `x` in binary.
