The code snippet updates the value of `a[i + 1]` to `-1`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `i`. Since the initial state only mentions that `bits` is `[0]` and `a` is `[1]`, and there is no index specified for updating `a[i + 1]`, we cannot determine the exact index being updated without additional information. Given the initial state and the provided code, the only valid index based on the initial `bits` list is `0` (since `bits[1]` would be out of range). 

Thus, `a[1]` is updated to `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is 0, `bits` is [0], `a` is [1, -1], `n` must be greater than 0**
