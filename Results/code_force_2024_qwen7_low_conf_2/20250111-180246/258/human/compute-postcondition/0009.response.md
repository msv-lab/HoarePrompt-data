The code `bit = x & 1` assigns the value of `x & 1` to the variable `bit`. The bitwise AND operator `&` between `x` and `1` results in `1` if the least significant bit of `x` is `1`, and `0` otherwise. Since `x` is initially `x // 2` and must be greater than `0`, the value of `x` is an integer greater than `0`. After the operation, the value of `bit` depends on the least significant bit of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is now `x // 2`, and `x` must be greater than 0; `bit` is `x & 1`**
