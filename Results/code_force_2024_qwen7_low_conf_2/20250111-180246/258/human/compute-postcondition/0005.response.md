The code `bit = x & 1` takes the bitwise AND of `x` and `1`. Since `1` in binary is `00000000000000000000000000000001`, the operation `x & 1` will yield the least significant bit (rightmost bit) of `x`. This least significant bit will be either `0` or `1` depending on whether `x` is even or odd. 

Given that `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) and \(x\) is not equal to 1, the value of `bit` will be either `0` or `1`. The initial state of `bits` being an empty list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) and \(x\) is not equal to 1; `bits` is an empty list; `bit` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\) and \(x\) is not equal to 1; `bits` is an empty list; `bit` is either 0 or 1.**
