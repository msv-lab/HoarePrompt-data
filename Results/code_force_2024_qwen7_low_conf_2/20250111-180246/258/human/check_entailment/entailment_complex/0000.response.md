### Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate an array `a` based on the input integer `x` such that the conditions specified in the problem statement are met.
   - If `x` is 1, the function directly returns `[1]`.
   - For other values of `x`, the function constructs the array `a` based on the binary representation of `x`.

2. **Binary Representation and Construction**:
   - The function iterates over the bits of `x` using a while loop, appending each bit to the `bits` list.
   - The loop runs until `x` becomes 0, and each iteration appends the least significant bit of `x` to the `bits` list and then right-shifts `x` by 1.
   - After the loop, `bits` contains the binary representation of `x` in reverse order.

3. **Constructing the Array `a`**:
   - The function then initializes an array `a` of zeros with the same length as `bits`.
   - It then iterates through the `bits` list and sets `a[i]` to 1 if `bits[i]` is 1 and `a[i+1]` to -1 if `bits[i+1]` is 1 (for indices within bounds).
   - This ensures that the array `a` satisfies the condition that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist (since only one bit can be 1 at any position).

4. **Validation of Conditions**:
   - The constructed array `a` satisfies the conditions:
     - The length of `a` is between 1 and 32.
     - Each element of `a` is either 1, 0, or -1.
     - The sum of `a[i] * 2^i` for all `i` equals `x`.
     - No two consecutive elements are non-zero.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis above, the function correctly implements the logic required to satisfy the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the provided implementation is correct.
