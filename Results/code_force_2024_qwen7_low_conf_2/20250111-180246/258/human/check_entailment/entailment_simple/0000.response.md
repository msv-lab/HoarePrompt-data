Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it fails to ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq 0\). Here's a detailed breakdown of why it is incorrect:

1. **Binary Representation Construction**: The program correctly constructs the binary representation of \(x\) and reverses it to form the list `bits`. This part is correct as it ensures that the sum of the elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals \(x\).

2. **Array Construction**: The program then constructs the array `a` based on the `bits` list. However, the logic used to populate `a` is flawed:
   - It sets `a[i]` to 1 if `bits[i]` is 1.
   - It sets `a[i+1]` to -1 if `bits[i+1]` is 1.
   
   This approach can lead to invalid arrays where there are consecutive non-zero elements. For example, consider \(x = 14\). The binary representation of 14 is `1110`. Following the current logic:
   - `a[0] = 1` (since `bits[0] = 1`)
   - `a[3] = -1` (since `bits[3] = 1`)
   
   This results in the array `[1, 0, 0, -1]`, which violates the condition that there should not be consecutive non-zero elements.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. One way to achieve this is to construct the array in a more controlled manner, ensuring that each non-zero element is isolated from another non-zero element.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function that meets the problem description:

```python
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return [1]
    
    bits = []
    while x > 0:
        bit = x & 1
        bits.append(bit)
        x >>= 1
    
    n = len(bits)
    a = [0] * n
    sign = 1  # Start with a positive sign
    
    for i in range(n):
        if bits[i]:
            a[i] = sign
            sign *= -1  # Alternate the sign for the next element
    
    return a
```

In this corrected version:
- We initialize `sign` to 1.
- We set `a[i]` to `sign` if `bits[i]` is 1.
- We alternate the sign for the next element, ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

With this change, the program will always generate a valid array that meets all the conditions specified in the problem description.
