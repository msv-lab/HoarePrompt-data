You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return [1]
    bits = []
    while x > 0:
        bit = x & 1
        bits.append(bit)
        x >>= 1
    n = len(bits)
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if bits[i]:
            a[i] = 1
        if bits[i + 1]:
            a[i + 1] = -1
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). If `x` is 1, it returns the list `[1]`. Otherwise, it constructs a list `a` where the first element is `1`, followed by `-1` repeated `n-2` times, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the last bit), and returns this list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array \(a\) of integers where each element is either 1, 0, or -1, and the sum of these elements with their respective powers of 2 should equal \(x\).
2. The solution uses bitwise operations to extract the binary representation of \(x\), but it needs adjustments to ensure the array satisfies the given constraints.
3. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly handle the requirement that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist. It also does not always produce a valid array that meets the criteria.

Let's analyze the function `func_1` step-by-step:
- The function handles the case when \(x = 1\) directly, returning `[1]`.
- For other values of \(x\), it initializes an empty list `bits` to store the bits of \(x\).
- It iteratively extracts bits from \(x\) using bitwise AND and right shift operations, appending them to `bits`.
- The length of `bits` gives the number of elements in the required array.
- It initializes an array `a` of zeros with the same length as `bits`.
- It then tries to assign values to `a` based on the extracted bits. If a bit is 1, it sets the corresponding position to 1. If the next bit is 1, it sets the current position to -1.

This approach has several issues:
- It does not ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
- It does not account for the possibility of different valid configurations of 1s and -1s.

A corrected approach would involve constructing the array from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) and ensuring that no two consecutive non-zero elements appear.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return [1]
    
    bits = []
    n = 0
    while x > 0:
        bit = x & 1
        bits.append(bit)
        x >>= 1
        n += 1
    
    # Ensure the array is at most 32 elements long
    if n > 32:
        return None  # This should never happen under given constraints
    
    a = [0] * 32
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < 32:
        if bits[i] == 1:
            a[j] = 1
            i += 1
            # Skip the next bit to avoid consecutive non-zero elements
            if i < n and bits[i] == 1:
                i += 1
        elif bits[i] == 0:
            a[j] = 0
            i += 1
        else:  # bits[i] == 0 and we need to make it -1
            a[j] = -1
            j -= 1
            if j >= 0 and bits[i] == 1:
                a[j] = 1
                j += 1
                i += 1
        j += 1
    
    # Trim the array to the actual size needed
    return a[:j]

# Example usage
for x in [1, 14, 24, 15, 27, 11, 19]:
    result = func_1(x)
    print(f"{len(result)}")
    print(" ".join(map(str, result)))
```

With this corrected approach, the function now ensures that the array `a` meets the problem constraints and produces a valid output for each test case.
