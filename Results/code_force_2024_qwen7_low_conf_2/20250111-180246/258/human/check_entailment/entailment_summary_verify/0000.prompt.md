You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func_1(x):
    if x == 1:
        return [1]
    bits = []
    while x > 0:
        bit = x & 1
        bits.append(bit)
        x >>= 1
    n = len(bits)
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if bits[i]:
            a[i] = 1
        if bits[i + 1]:
            a[i + 1] = -1
    return a



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `x` such that \(1 \leq x < 2^{30}\). If `x` is 1, it returns the list `[1]`. Otherwise, it constructs a list `a` where the first element is `1`, followed by `-1` repeated `n-2` times, where `n` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `x` (excluding the last bit), and returns this list `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not satisfy the condition that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). Consider the input \(x = 14\):

- The program generates the array \([0, -1, 0, 0, 1]\), which is a valid representation of \(14\) in base-2 notation but does not satisfy the constraint because \(a_1 = -1\) and \(a_2 = 0\) (no zero between non-zero elements, but we can see that no two consecutive non-zero elements are present).

However, a more critical issue is observed in the input \(x = 15\):

- The program generates the array \([-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\). This array is not valid because it does not represent \(15\) correctly as \(15 = 1 \cdot 2^0 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^3\), and it also violates the condition that there should not be two consecutive non-zero elements. The correct representation should be \([1, 1, 1, 1]\).

Thus, the program fails to generate the required array for \(x = 15\), making it incorrect.
