Reasoning:
The provided program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, the program's logic for constructing the array `a` is flawed because it does not ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist, except possibly the last element being non-zero. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Handling of Single Bit Case**: The function correctly handles the case when `x` is 1 by returning `[1]`.

2. **Bit Extraction and Array Construction**:
   - The function extracts the bits of `x` and stores them in the `bits` list.
   - It then constructs the array `a` with the first element set to 1 and the rest of the elements set to -1.
   - This construction does not guarantee that there are no two consecutive non-zero elements.

3. **Requirement Violation**: The problem specifies that there should not exist an index `0 ≤ i ≤ n - 2` such that both `a_{i} ≠ 0` and `a_{i + 1} ≠ 0`. However, the current implementation sets the entire array `a` to `-1` after the first element, which violates this condition for many values of `x`.

Given these observations, the program does not meet the problem's requirement for constructing a valid array `a`.

Correctness: **False**
