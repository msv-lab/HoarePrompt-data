Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not satisfy the condition that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). Consider the input \(x = 14\):

- The program generates the array \([0, -1, 0, 0, 1]\), which is a valid representation of \(14\) in base-2 notation but does not satisfy the constraint because \(a_1 = -1\) and \(a_2 = 0\) (no zero between non-zero elements, but we can see that no two consecutive non-zero elements are present).

However, a more critical issue is observed in the input \(x = 15\):

- The program generates the array \([-1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\). This array is not valid because it does not represent \(15\) correctly as \(15 = 1 \cdot 2^0 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^3\), and it also violates the condition that there should not be two consecutive non-zero elements. The correct representation should be \([1, 1, 1, 1]\).

Thus, the program fails to generate the required array for \(x = 15\), making it incorrect.
