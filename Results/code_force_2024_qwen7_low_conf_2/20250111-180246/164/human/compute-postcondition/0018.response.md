According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `next_platform`. For the loop to execute, `next_platform` must be a valid element in the list `graph[current_platform]`. The initial state provides information about `graph`, `m`, `queue`, `visited`, `current_platform`, and `steps`. 

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Graph (`graph`)**: The list `graph` contains `n` lists. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one platform connected to `current_platform` (i.e., `next_platform` must be a valid element in `graph[current_platform]`).

2. **Current Platform (`current_platform`)**: It is stated that `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`. This ensures that we are not starting from the last platform in the graph.

3. **Next Platform (`next_platform`)**: To enter the loop, `next_platform` must exist within the `graph[current_platform]` list. Therefore, `graph[current_platform]` must contain at least one element.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state to ensure that `next_platform` is a valid element in `graph[current_platform]`.

State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([]), `visited` is {`(0, levels[0])`}, `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 0, `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`**
