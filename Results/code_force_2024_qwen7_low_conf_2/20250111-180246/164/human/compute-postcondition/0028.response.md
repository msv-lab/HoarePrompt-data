`visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. The `next_state` is defined as `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H)`. The `visited` set is updated with this new state. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([(next_p_val, 3)])` if a valid `next_p_val` is found, or `deque([])` if no valid `next_p_val` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H)`, `current_platform` is the same as before, `steps` is 2.**
