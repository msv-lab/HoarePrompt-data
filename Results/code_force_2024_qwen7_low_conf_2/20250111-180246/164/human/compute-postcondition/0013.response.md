According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, the state is as follows:
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists
- `m` is 0
- `queue` is deque([(0, 0)])
- `visited` is {`(0, levels[0])`}
- `levels` is undefined

For the loop to execute at least once, `queue` must contain at least one element. The current state shows that `queue` is already containing one element (deque([(0, 0)])). Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the `queue` state itself for the loop to execute.

The other states (`graph`, `m`, `visited`, and `levels`) do not affect the condition of the `while` loop directly. They are just part of the overall program state.

So, the state right before the loop remains the same:

State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([(0, 0)]), `visited` is {`(0, levels[0])`}, `levels` is undefined**
