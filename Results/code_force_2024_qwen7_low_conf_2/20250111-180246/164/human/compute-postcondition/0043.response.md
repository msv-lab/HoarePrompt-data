Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed, `current_platform` is the first element's platform from `queue`, `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`, `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`. If `current_platform` is the last platform (i.e., `n - 1`), the function returns `steps`, which is the number of steps taken from the first element in `queue`. Otherwise, no change is made to the program state.***
