The code updates the value of `next_state` to `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. Let's break this down:

1. `next_state` is assigned a new value based on `next_platform`.
2. The second part of the assignment, `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, is calculated and appended to `next_state`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `m` is 0.
- `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed and possibly updated with `next_state`, `current_platform`, and `steps`.
- `current_platform` and `steps` are the first element's platform and steps from the updated `queue`.
- `visited` includes `next_state`.
- `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary.
- `next_platform` is the next valid platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.

After the code runs, the value of `next_state` will be updated to include `next_platform` followed by `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed and possibly updated with `next_state`, `current_platform`, and `steps`, `current_platform` and `steps` are the first element's platform and steps from the updated `queue`, `visited` includes `next_state`, `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`**
