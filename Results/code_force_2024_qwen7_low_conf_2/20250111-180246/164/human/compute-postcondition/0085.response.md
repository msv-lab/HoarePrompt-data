The code assigns the value of `next_platform` and the expression `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` to the variable `next_state`. Let's break down the impact:

- `next_platform` is already defined from the initial state.
- The expression `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H` calculates a new value for the second element of `next_state`.

Given this, the output state will be:

- `current_platform` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- `steps` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- `queue` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
- `next_state` is now the tuple consisting of `next_platform` and the calculated value `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, and `next_state` is a new tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`**.
