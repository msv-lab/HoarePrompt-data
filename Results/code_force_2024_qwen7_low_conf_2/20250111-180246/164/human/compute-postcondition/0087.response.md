The code `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))` appends a new tuple to the `queue`. The new tuple is `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, where `next_platform` is the current value of `next_platform` and `steps + 1` is the updated value of `steps`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `visited` contains the next_state which is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), and `next_state` is a new tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.**
