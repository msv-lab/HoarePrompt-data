The code assigns a new tuple to `next_state` using the value of `next_platform` and the expression `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. 

Given the initial state:
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists,
- `m` is 0,
- `queue` is either `deque([(next_platform, 3)])` if a valid `next_platform` is found, or `deque([])` if no valid `next_platform` is found,
- `visited` is updated based on the new `next_platform` and `levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]`,
- `current_platform` is the same as before,
- `steps` is 2,
- `next_platform` is the first element in the updated `queue`.

Let's denote the value of `next_platform` as `next_p_val`, and the values of `levels[next_p_val]` and `changes[next_p_val]` as `level_val` and `change_val` respectively.

The code updates `next_state` as follows:
- `next_state = (next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H)`

Since the other variables (`graph`, `m`, `queue`, `visited`, `current_platform`, and `steps`) are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([(next_p_val, 3)])` if a valid `next_p_val` is found, or `deque([])` if no valid `next_p_val` is found, `visited` is updated based on the new `next_p_val` and `(level_val + change_val) % H`, `current_platform` is the same as before, `steps` is 2, and `next_state` is `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H).**
