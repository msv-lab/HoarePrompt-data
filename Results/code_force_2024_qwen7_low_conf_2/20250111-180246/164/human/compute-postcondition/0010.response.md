Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer (though not directly relevant to the loop).
- `n` and `H` are positive integers (though not directly relevant to the loop).
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `levels` and `changes` are lists of `n` integers each.
- `passages` is a list of `m` pairs of integers.
- `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists.

### Loop Code
```
for u, v in passages:
    graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
    graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
```

### Analysis

1. **First Iteration:**
   - For the first pair `(u, v)` in `passages`, `graph[u - 1]` gets `v - 1` appended.
   - Simultaneously, `graph[v - 1]` gets `u - 1` appended.
   - Example: If `passages[0] = (1, 2)`, then `graph[0].append(1)` and `graph[1].append(0)`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - For the second pair `(u, v)` in `passages`, the same logic applies.
   - `graph[u - 1]` gets `v - 1` appended, and `graph[v - 1]` gets `u - 1` appended.
   - Example: If `passages[1] = (2, 3)`, then `graph[1].append(2)` and `graph[2].append(1)`.

3. **General Iteration:**
   - For every pair `(u, v)` in `passages`, the following happens:
     - `graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)`
     - `graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)`

4. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Each pair `(u, v)` in `passages` ensures that both `u - 1` and `v - 1` are added to each otherâ€™s respective positions in the `graph`.
   - Therefore, for each `i` in `0` to `n-1`, `graph[i]` will contain all nodes connected to node `i+1`.

5. **Special Case: If the loop does not execute (i.e., `m` is 0):**
   - In this case, `graph` remains as initially defined, which means all `graph[i]` are empty lists.

### Final Output State
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists where each `graph[i]` contains all nodes (indices) that are directly connected to node `i+1` through the `passages`.
- If `m` is 0, `graph` remains a list of `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists where each `graph[i]` contains all indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i+1` and node `j+1` in the `passages` list. If `m` is 0, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists.**
