The code updates the value of `levels[current_platform]` to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`. This means that the value of `levels[current_platform]` is modified according to the given formula. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` contains the tuples of the shortest path found from the first element in the original queue to all reachable platforms with the same level, `current_platform` and `steps` are the platform and steps from the first element of `queue`, `visited` includes all visited `(platform, level)` pairs, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.**
