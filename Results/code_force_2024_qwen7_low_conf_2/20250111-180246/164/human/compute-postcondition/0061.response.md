`queue` is modified by appending a new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`. The value of `next_platform` and `steps` remain unchanged from their previous values. The variable `queue` now includes this new tuple. The states of the other variables (`m`, `current_platform`, `visited`, `levels`, `next_state`, and `changes`) are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `queue` includes the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `visited` now includes `next_state`, `levels[next_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`**
