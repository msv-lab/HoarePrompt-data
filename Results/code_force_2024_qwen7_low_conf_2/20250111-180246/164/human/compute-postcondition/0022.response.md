The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Since this addition modifies the `visited` set, the output state will reflect this change.

Given the initial conditions:
- `visited` initially contains the tuple `(0, levels[0])`.
- `next_state` is not in `visited`.

After executing `visited.add(next_state)`, `next_state` will be added to `visited`. The exact value of `next_state` depends on the current `next_platform`, `levels[next_platform]`, and `changes[next_platform]`, but it is guaranteed to be a new entry because `next_state` is not already in `visited`.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([]), `visited` is {(0, levels[0]), next_state}, `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 0, `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)**
