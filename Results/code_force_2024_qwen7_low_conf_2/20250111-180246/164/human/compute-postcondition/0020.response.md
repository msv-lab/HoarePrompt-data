`next_state` is assigned the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. The value of `next_platform` is unchanged, but the value of the second element of the tuple depends on the current values of `levels[next_platform]` and `changes[next_platform]`. Since the level of the `current_platform` is equal to the level of the `next_platform`, the value of `levels[next_platform]` is the same as the level of the `current_platform`. However, the specific values of `next_platform`, `levels[next_platform]`, and `changes[next_platform]` are not provided.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `graph` remains a list of `n` lists.
- `m` remains 0.
- `queue` remains `deque([])`.
- `visited` remains `{(0, levels[0])}`.
- `current_platform` remains less than `n - 1`.
- `steps` remains 0.
- `next_platform` remains an element in `graph[current_platform]`.
- `next_state` is the tuple `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([]), `visited` is {(0, levels[0])}, `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 0, `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`, and `next_state` is (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)**.
