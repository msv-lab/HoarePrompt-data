The code updates the value of `levels[current_platform]` to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`. This means that the value of `levels[current_platform]` will be recalculated based on its current value, the value of `changes[current_platform]`, and the modulus operation with `H`.

All other variables (`current_platform`, `steps`, `queue`, and `visited`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `queue` is the original queue with the elements removed corresponding to the number of iterations the loop has executed and appended with tuples of the form `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing all the unique `next_state` tuples of the form `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` that were added during the iterations provided that `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`, and `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.**
