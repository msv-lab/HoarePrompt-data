The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the `visited` set. The `next_state` is defined as `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. Since the code only adds `next_state` to the `visited` set and does not modify any other variables, the output state remains unchanged for all other variables.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed and possibly updated with `next_state`, `current_platform` and `steps` are the first element's platform and steps from the updated `queue`, `visited` includes `next_state`, `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`**
