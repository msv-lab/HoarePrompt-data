The code creates a set called `visited` and assigns it the value of a set containing a tuple `(0, levels[0])`. The variable `levels` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `levels[0]`. However, we know that `visited` is now a set containing this tuple.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([(0, 0)]), `visited` is {`(0, levels[0])`}, `levels` is undefined**
