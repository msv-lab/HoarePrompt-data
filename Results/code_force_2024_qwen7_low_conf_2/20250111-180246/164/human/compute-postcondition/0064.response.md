Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` contains the tuples of the shortest path found from the first element in the original queue to all reachable platforms with the same level, `current_platform` and `steps` are the platform and steps from the first element of `queue`, `visited` includes all visited `(platform, level)` pairs, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`. If there are no more elements in `queue`, the function returns `steps`, which is the number of steps taken from the first element in the original queue. If `current_platform` is the last platform (i.e., `n - 1`), the function returns `steps`. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is added to `queue` and `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary. If `next_state` is already in `visited`, no change is made to the `queue` and `levels`.**
