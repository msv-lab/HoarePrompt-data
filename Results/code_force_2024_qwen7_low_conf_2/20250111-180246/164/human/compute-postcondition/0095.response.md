Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `H`, along with lists `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`. It constructs a graph representation of the platforms and their connections. The function then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the last platform (`n-1`). During the BFS, it updates the levels of the platforms based on the changes list and ensures that only valid transitions are made.

After executing the BFS, the function returns one of the following:
- **Case 1:** If a path to the last platform is found, it returns `0` if the number of steps taken is `0`, otherwise, it returns the number of steps taken.
- **Case 2:** If a path to the last platform is found, it returns the number of steps taken from the first element in the queue.
- **Case 3:** If a path to the last platform is found, it returns the leftmost element of the original queue, which represents the first platform visited.
- **Case 4:** If no path to the last platform is found, it returns `-1`.

The function covers all potential edge cases, including scenarios where the graph is empty (if `m` is `0`) and ensures that all possible paths are considered during the BFS.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `m` is `0`, the graph will be empty, and the function will return `-1` since there are no passages to traverse.
- If the BFS does not find a path to the last platform (`n-1`), the function returns `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions four possible return cases, but the code only directly returns `-1` in one case. The other cases are implied through the BFS logic and the handling of the queue. The code ensures that if a path is found, it correctly handles the return values based on the steps taken and the first element in the queue.**

This summary captures the essential actions and states of the function, considering both the code and the provided annotations.
