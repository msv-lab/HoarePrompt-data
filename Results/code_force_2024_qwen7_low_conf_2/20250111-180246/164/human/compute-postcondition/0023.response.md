The code appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the queue. Here's the step-by-step impact:

- `queue` was initially `deque([])`.
- After the code execution, `queue` now contains the new element `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.
- The other variables remain unchanged: `graph`, `m`, `queue`, `visited`, `current_platform`, `steps`, `next_platform`, and `next_state`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists.
- `m` is 0.
- `queue` is `deque([(next_platform, steps + 1)])`.
- `visited` is `{(0, levels[0]), next_state}`.
- `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`.
- `steps` is 1 (since `steps + 1` was added to the queue).
- `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`.
- `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is `deque([(next_platform, steps + 1)])`, `visited` is `{(0, levels[0]), next_state}`, `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 1, `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**.
