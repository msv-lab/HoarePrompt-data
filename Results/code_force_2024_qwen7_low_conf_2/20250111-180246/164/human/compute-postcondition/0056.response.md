Postcondition: ***`m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element possibly updated and removed plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `current_platform` and `steps` are the platform and steps from the first element of the updated `queue`, `visited` includes `next_state`, `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `next_state` is added to `queue` and `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary. If `next_state` is already in `visited`, no change is made to the `queue` and `levels`.***
