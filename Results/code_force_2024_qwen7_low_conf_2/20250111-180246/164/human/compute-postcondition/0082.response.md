Postcondition: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, and `next_state` is added to the `visited` set if the condition `next_state not in visited` is true.**
