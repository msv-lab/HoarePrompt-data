The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `a` > 0 and `b` >= 0. The function returns either the original value of `b` along with 0 and 1, or the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, `x` which is `y1 - b // a * x1`, and `y` which is `x1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `a` > 0), and return either the original value of `b` along with 0 and 1, or the gcd of `a` and `b`, `x` which is `y1 - b // a * x1`, and `y` which is `x1`.
