`queue` appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to itself. The value of `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`. The value of `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`. Therefore, `steps + 1` represents the incremented number of steps.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `current_platform` is the first element's platform from `queue`, `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`, `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited including `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
