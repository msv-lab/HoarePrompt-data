The code assigns `next_state` as a tuple with the first element being `next_platform` and the second element being `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. The value of `next_state` is directly derived from `next_platform` and the calculation involving `levels[next_platform]` and `changes[next_platform]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `current_platform` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- `steps` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- `queue` remains the same as it was in the initial state.
- `next_state` is updated to be a tuple with the first element being `next_platform` and the second element being `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.**
