`queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the `queue`. In this case, the initial `queue` is `deque([(0, 0)])`. So, `current_platform` is assigned the first tuple in the `queue`, which is `0`, and `steps` is assigned the second element in the tuple, which is `0`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([]), `visited` is {`(0, levels[0])`}, `current_platform` is 0, `steps` is 0**
