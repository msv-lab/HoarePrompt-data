Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is added to `visited`. This holds true if `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the initial state described in the precondition.***
