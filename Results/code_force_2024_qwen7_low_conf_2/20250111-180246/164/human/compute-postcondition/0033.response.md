The code assigns `next_state` to a tuple consisting of `next_platform` and the result of `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. This means that `next_state` will be a tuple with the same first element as `next_platform` and the second element being the result of the modulo operation.

Given the initial state:
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists
- `m` is 0
- `queue` is either `deque([('next_platform', 3)])` or `deque([])` depending on whether a valid `next_platform` is found
- `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`
- `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`
- `steps` is 2

After the code executes:
- `next_state` is assigned the value `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([('next_platform', 3)])` or `deque([])` depending on whether a valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is 2, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
