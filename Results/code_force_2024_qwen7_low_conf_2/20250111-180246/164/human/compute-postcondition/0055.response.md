The code appends a tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the `queue`. From the initial state, we know:
- `m` is 0
- `queue` is the original queue with its first element possibly updated and removed
- `current_platform` and `steps` are the platform and steps from the first element of the updated `queue`
- `visited` includes `next_state`
- `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary
- `next_state` is `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`

After executing `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))`:
- The `queue` now contains the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended to it.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element possibly updated and removed plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `current_platform` and `steps` are the platform and steps from the first element of the updated `queue`, `visited` includes `next_state`, `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`**
