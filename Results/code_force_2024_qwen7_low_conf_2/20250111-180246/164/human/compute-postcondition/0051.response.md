Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed. If `next_state` (which is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`) is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `next_state`. `current_platform` and `steps` remain as the first element's platform and steps from `queue`, `visited` now includes `next_state`, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, and `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`. If `next_state` is already in `visited`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
