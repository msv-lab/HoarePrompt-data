Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([(`next_platform`, 3)]) if a valid `next_platform` is found, or deque([]) if no valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H)`, `current_platform` is the same as before, `steps` is 2, and `next_state` is `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H)`. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `queue` remains unchanged and `visited` includes the new state. If `next_state` is already in `visited`, then `queue` remains empty and `visited` includes the state `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H).***
