The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` tuple to the set `visited`. Given the initial state, `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. The addition of `next_state` to `visited` means that the `next_state` tuple is now part of the `visited` set.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `queue` includes the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` was not in `visited`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `visited` now includes `next_state`, `levels[next_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
