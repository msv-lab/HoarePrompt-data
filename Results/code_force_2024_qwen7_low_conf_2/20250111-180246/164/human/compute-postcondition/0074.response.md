The code adds `next_state` to the set `visited`. This means that the state represented by `next_state` (which includes `next_platform` and the modified value `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`) is now marked as visited.

The variables `current_platform`, `steps`, `queue`, and the contents of `next_state` (including `next_platform` and the modified value) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue`, `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed, `next_state` is a tuple with first element `next_platform` and second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, and `next_state` is now in `visited`**
