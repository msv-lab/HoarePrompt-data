To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `current_platform` is a valid platform index.
   - `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue` + 1.
   - `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended.
   - `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
   - If `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`, then `next_state` is added to `visited`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.

3. **Key Considerations**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `queue` and `current_platform` is updated within each iteration.

Given the above, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

- `current_platform` should be set to the next platform obtained from `graph[current_platform]`.
- `steps` should be updated to `steps + 1` since we are considering the next platform.
- `queue` should be adjusted to remove the current element and append the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`.
- `next_state` should be recalculated based on the new `next_platform` and `levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform] % H`.
- `visited` should be updated if `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. If `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is added to `visited`.**
