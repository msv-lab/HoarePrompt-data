Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is the leftmost element of `queue`; `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue`; `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed. If `current_platform` equals `n - 1`, the function returns `steps`. If `current_platform` does not equal `n - 1`, the function continues without returning anything, and the queue remains unchanged.***
