Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `graph` is a list of `n` lists.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `queue` is either `deque([(next_platform, steps + 1)])` if `(next_platform, levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform])` is not in `visited`, or `deque([])` if it is already in `visited`.
   - `visited` is updated accordingly based on whether `(next_platform, levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform])` is in `visited`.
   - `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`.
   - `steps` is 1.
   - `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop iterates over each `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]` such that `next_platform` is different from `current_platform` (to ensure progress).

4. **Key Variables**:
   - `current_platform`: This variable remains unchanged within the loop but is used to determine the next platforms to explore.
   - `steps`: This is incremented by 1 each time the loop iterates, so `steps` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `queue`: The state of the queue is determined by whether a valid `next_platform` is found.
   - `visited`: This set is updated based on the current `next_platform` and `levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `m` will remain 0 since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `queue` will be updated based on the new `next_platform` and `steps` value.
   - `visited` will be updated based on the new `next_platform` and `levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]`.
   - `current_platform` will remain the same unless a new `next_platform` is chosen, but since we are only looking at the start of the next iteration, we assume `current_platform` remains unchanged.
   - `steps` will be incremented to 2.
   - `next_platform` will be the first element in the updated `queue` if `queue` is not empty.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `graph` remains the same.
- `m` remains 0.
- `queue` is updated to `deque([(next_platform, steps + 1)])` where `next_platform` is the first element in the updated `queue` if the queue is not empty, or `deque([])` if no valid `next_platform` is found.
- `visited` is updated accordingly.
- `current_platform` remains the same.
- `steps` is 2.
- `next_platform` is the first element in the updated `queue`.

State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([(next_platform, 3)])` if a valid `next_platform` is found, or `deque([])` if no valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` is updated based on the new `next_platform` and `levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]`, `current_platform` is the same as before, `steps` is 2, and `next_platform` is the first element in the updated `queue`.**
