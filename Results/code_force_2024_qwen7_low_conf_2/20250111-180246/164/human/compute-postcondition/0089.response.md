Postcondition: ***`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is incremented by 1, `queue` is updated by removing the current element and appending a new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `visited` includes the new `next_state` which is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and `next_state` is a new tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, provided that `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`. If `levels[current_platform]` does not equal `levels[next_platform]`, the `queue`, `visited`, and `next_state` remain unchanged.***
