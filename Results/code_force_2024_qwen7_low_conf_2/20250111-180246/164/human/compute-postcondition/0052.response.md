Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `graph` is a list of `n` lists.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed.
   - `current_platform` and `steps` are the first element's platform and steps from `queue`.
   - `visited` now includes `next_state`.
   - `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `next_state` (which is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`) is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `next_state`.
   - `current_platform` and `steps` remain as the first element's platform and steps from `queue`.
   - `visited` now includes `next_state`.
   - `levels[current_platform]` is updated to `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.
   - If `next_state` is already in `visited`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `m` will still be 0 since it was not modified inside the loop.
   - `queue` is updated based on the loop body, but we need to consider the state just before entering the loop.
   - `current_platform` and `steps` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop unless they are the first element of the updated `queue`.
   - `visited` includes `next_state`, and if the new `next_state` is added to `queue`, it will be processed in subsequent iterations.
   - `levels[current_platform]` might change if the loop body updates it.
   - `next_platform` is determined within the loop based on the condition `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `m` remains 0.
- `queue` is updated to remove its first element and potentially add `next_state` to it.
- `current_platform` and `steps` remain as the first element's platform and steps from the updated `queue`.
- `visited` includes `next_state`.
- `levels[current_platform]` may have been updated.
- `next_platform` is the next valid platform for the current state.

State: **`m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed and possibly updated with `next_state`, `current_platform` and `steps` are the first element's platform and steps from the updated `queue`, `visited` includes `next_state`, `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary, and `next_platform` is the next valid platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`**.
