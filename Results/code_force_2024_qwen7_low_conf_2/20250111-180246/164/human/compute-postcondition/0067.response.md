The `queue.popleft()` function is called, which removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue. The values of the variables `current_platform` and `steps` are set to the values of this removed element. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`current_platform` is the leftmost element of `queue`; `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue`; `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed.**
