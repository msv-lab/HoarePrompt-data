Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([(next_platform, steps + 1)])` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, or remains `deque([])` if `next_state` is already in `visited`. `visited` is updated to either `{(0, levels[0]), next_state}` if `next_state` is not in `visited`, or remains unchanged if `next_state` is already in `visited`. `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 1, `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`, and `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`***
