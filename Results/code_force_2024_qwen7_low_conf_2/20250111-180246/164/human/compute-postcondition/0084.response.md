To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and follow the logic step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `current_platform` is a valid platform index.
   - `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1.
   - `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended.
   - `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
   - `next_state` is added to the `visited` set if `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]` and `next_state not in visited`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `next_platform` in `graph[current_platform]`.
   - For each `next_platform`, the loop body (which is omitted) will be executed.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `queue`.

### State Adjustment:

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `current_platform` is a valid platform index.
- `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1.
- `queue` contains the updated tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` and potentially other elements.
- `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
- `next_state` is added to the `visited` set if `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]` and `next_state not in visited`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition for the loop to continue must still be satisfied, which means there must be elements in the `queue`.

### Adjusted States:

- Since the loop body has been executed, the `current_platform` remains the same (as it is derived from the `next_platform` which is processed within the loop).
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `queue` should still contain elements, specifically the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` added to it.
- `next_state` is a new tuple that needs to be considered for the next iteration.

Given these points, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `current_platform` remains the same.
- `steps` is incremented by 1.
- `queue` now contains the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` added to it.
- `next_state` is a new tuple derived from the next platform being processed.

### Final Answer:

State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, and `next_state` is a new tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.**
