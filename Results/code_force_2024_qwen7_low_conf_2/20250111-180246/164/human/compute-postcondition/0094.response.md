The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `H`, which are all positive integers, and `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`, which are lists. Specifically, `levels` and `changes` are lists of `n` integers each, and `passages` is a list of `m` pairs of integers. Each element in `levels` and `changes` indexes into platform indices from 0 to `n-1`, and each pair in `passages` represents a bidirectional passage between two platforms.

The function has four possible return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns `0`.
- Case_2: The function returns `steps`, which is the number of steps taken from the first element in `queue`.
- Case_3: The function returns the leftmost element of the original `queue`.
- Case_4: The function returns `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, and `H`, along with lists `levels`, `changes`, and `passages`, and based on certain conditions, return either `0`, the number of steps taken from the first element in `queue`, the leftmost element of the original `queue`, or `-1`.
