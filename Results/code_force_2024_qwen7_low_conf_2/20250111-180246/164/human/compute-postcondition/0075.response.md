The code appends a tuple to the `queue`. The tuple contains the `next_platform` and `steps + 1`. The `next_platform` is the first element of the `next_state` tuple, and `steps + 1` is the current value of `steps` incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue` plus 1, `queue` is the original queue with the new tuple appended, `next_state` is a tuple with first element `next_platform` and second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, and `next_state` is now in `visited`.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with first element `next_platform` and second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, and `next_state` is now in `visited`**.
