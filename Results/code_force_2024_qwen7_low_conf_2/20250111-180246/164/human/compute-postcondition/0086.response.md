The code `visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The `next_state` is a tuple with the first element being `next_platform` and the second element being `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

The impact of this code is that the `visited` set now includes the `next_state`. The other variables (`current_platform`, `steps`, `queue`) remain unchanged from their initial values.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `visited` contains the next_state which is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H), and `next_state` is a new tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.**
