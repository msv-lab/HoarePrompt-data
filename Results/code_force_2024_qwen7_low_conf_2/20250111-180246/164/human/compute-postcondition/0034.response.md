`visited.add(next_state)` adds the `next_state` to the set `visited`. The `next_state` is defined as `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. Since the `next_state` is already included in the condition, it means that the set `visited` now contains this specific tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([('next_platform', 3)])` or `deque([])` depending on whether a valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` plus the added `next_state`, `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is 2**
