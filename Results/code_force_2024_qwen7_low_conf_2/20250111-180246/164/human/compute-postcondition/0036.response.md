Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([('next_platform', 3)])` or `deque([])` depending on whether a valid `next_platform` is found. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` plus the added `next_state`, `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, and `steps` is 3. If `next_state` is in `visited`, the state remains unchanged.***
