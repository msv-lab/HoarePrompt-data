Postcondition: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with first element `next_platform` and second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, `next_state` is added to `visited`.**
