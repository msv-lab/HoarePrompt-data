The code assigns a new value to `next_state`. Specifically, `next_state` is set to a tuple containing `next_platform` and `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`. 

From the precondition, we know:
- `current_platform` is a valid platform index.
- `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue`.
- `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed.
- `graph[current_platform]` must have at least one element.
- The levels of `current_platform` and `next_platform` are equal.

However, the actual value of `next_platform` is not given in the code snippet, nor are the specific values of `levels[next_platform]` and `changes[next_platform]`. Therefore, we can only represent these values symbolically.

Thus, the output state will be:

- `current_platform` remains unchanged.
- `steps` remains unchanged.
- `queue` remains unchanged.
- `next_state` is a tuple where the first element is `next_platform` and the second element is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the leftmost element of `queue`, `queue` is the original queue with the leftmost element removed, `next_state` is a tuple with first element `next_platform` and second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`**
