The code appends a new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` to the queue. This affects the `queue` variable, which now includes the new tuple along with the original elements.

Given the initial state:
- `current_platform` is a valid platform index.
- `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1.
- `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed and the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended.
- `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.
- `visited` contains the tuple `next_state`.

After executing `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))`, the `queue` will include the new tuple.

Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the current value of `steps` + 1, `queue` is the original queue with the current element removed, the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` appended, `next_state` is a tuple with the first element `next_platform` and the second element `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`, `visited` contains the tuple `next_state`**.
