Output State: **`num_platforms` is an integer such that 2 ≤ num_platforms ≤ 10^5, `num_passages` is an integer such that 1 ≤ num_passages ≤ 10^5, `max_level` is an integer such that 1 ≤ max_level ≤ 10^9, `levels` is a list of `num_platforms` integers where each integer is in the range [0, `max_level`-1], `changes` is a list of `num_platforms` integers where each integer is in the range [0, `max_level`-1], and `passages` is a list of `num_passages` tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indices (1-based) of the platforms connected by a passage, and the function "Calculate the minimum number of steps needed to reach from platform 1 to platform `num_platforms`" has been defined.**
