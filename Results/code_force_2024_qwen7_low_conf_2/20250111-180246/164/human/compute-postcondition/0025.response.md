Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([(next_platform, steps + 1)])` if `(next_platform, levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform])` is not in `visited`, or remains `deque([])` if it is already in `visited`. `visited` is updated to either `{(0, levels[0]), (next_platform, levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H}` if `(next_platform, levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform])` is not in `visited`, or remains unchanged if it is already in `visited`. `current_platform` is less than `n - 1`, `steps` is 1, and `next_platform` is an element in `graph[current_platform]`.***
