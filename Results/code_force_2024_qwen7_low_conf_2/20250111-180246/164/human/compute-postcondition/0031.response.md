Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either deque([(`next_platform`, 3)]) or deque([]) depending on whether a valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `current_platform` is the same as before, `steps` is 2. If `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]` and `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `queue` remains unchanged and `visited` includes the new state. If `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]` and `next_state` is already in `visited`, then `queue` remains empty and `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H).***
