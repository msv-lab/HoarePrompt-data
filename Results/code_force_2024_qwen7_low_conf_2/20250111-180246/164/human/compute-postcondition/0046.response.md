The code assigns the value of `next_platform` and the updated level to `next_state`. Since `next_platform` is already defined, we know it is a valid platform, and the level is calculated as `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

Here are the updates:
- `next_state` is now a tuple containing `next_platform` and the updated level, which is `(levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `graph` is a list of `n` lists.
- `m` is still 0.
- `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed.
- `current_platform` is the first element's platform from `queue`.
- `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`.
- `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited.
- `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
- `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed, `current_platform` is the first element's platform from `queue`, `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`, `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
