Output State: **`current_platform` is a valid platform index, `steps` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `queue` is the original queue with the elements removed corresponding to the number of iterations the loop has executed and appended with tuples of the form `(next_platform, steps + 1)`, `visited` is a set containing all the unique `next_state` tuples of the form `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` that were added during the iterations, provided that `levels[current_platform]` equals `levels[next_platform]`. If `levels[current_platform]` does not equal `levels[next_platform]`, the corresponding `next_state` is not added to `visited`. If the loop does not execute, the values of `current_platform`, `steps`, and `queue` remain as they were initially, and `visited` remains an empty set.**
