Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `m` is 0
   - `queue` includes the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` was not in `visited`
   - `current_platform` is `next_platform`
   - `steps` is incremented by 1
   - `visited` remains the same
   - `levels[next_platform]` is updated if necessary

2. The code snippet updates the `next_state` variable:
   ```python
   next_state = next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H
   ```

3. Let's denote the values before this code snippet:
   - `next_platform` (let's call it `p`)
   - `levels[p]` (let's call it `l`)
   - `changes[p]` (let's call it `c`)
   - `H` (let's assume it is known)

4. After executing the code snippet, `next_state` will be:
   - `next_state = (p, (l + c) % H)`

5. Since the code does not affect any other variables except `next_state`, the other variables remain in their initial or previously calculated states.

Output State: **`m` is 0, `queue` includes the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` was not in `visited`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `visited` remains the same, `levels[next_platform]` is updated if necessary, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`**
