The code `queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))` appends a tuple to the `queue`. The first element of the tuple is `next_platform`, and the second element is `steps + 1`. 

- `next_platform` is a variable that holds a specific value from the initial state.
- `steps` is initially 2.

Therefore, the new value of `steps + 1` will be `3`.

Since `queue` is a deque, appending a tuple to it does not change its nature as a deque, but it does add a new element to it.

The output state is: `graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is either `deque([('next_platform', 3)])` or `deque([('next_platform', 3)])` depending on whether a valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)` plus the added `next_state`, `current_platform` is the next platform in `graph[current_platform]`, `steps` is 3.
