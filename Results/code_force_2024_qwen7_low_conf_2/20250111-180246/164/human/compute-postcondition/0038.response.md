Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is a deque containing valid `(platform, steps)` pairs that have been discovered and added to the queue, `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited, `current_platform` is the last valid platform added to the queue, `steps` is the number of steps taken to reach the current platform. If no valid platform is found, `queue` remains empty, `visited` includes all previously visited states, and `current_platform` remains unchanged, `steps` is still 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Graph**: Remains unchanged as the graph itself does not change within the loop.
- **Queue**: Contains all valid `(platform, steps)` pairs that have been discovered and added to the queue. Initially starts as an empty deque, but gets updated each time a valid next platform is found and added.
- **Visited**: Contains all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited. This set grows as the loop continues to find new valid states.
- **Current_Platform**: Tracks the last valid platform that was added to the queue. It may change if a valid next platform is found, but if no valid platform is found, it remains unchanged.
- **Steps**: Tracks the number of steps taken to reach the current platform. It increments by 1 each time a valid next platform is found and added to the queue.

If the loop does not execute (e.g., if there are no valid platforms starting from `current_platform`), `queue` remains empty, `visited` includes all previously visited states, and `current_platform` and `steps` remain unchanged with `steps` being 0.
