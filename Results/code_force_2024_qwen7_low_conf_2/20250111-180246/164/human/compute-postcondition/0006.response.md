The code assigns the value of `x1` to `y`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, `gcd_val`, `x1`, `y1`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `b` is a non-negative integer, the GCD of `a` and `b` is `gcd_val`, `x1` and `y1` are the coefficients such that `gcd_val = x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`, `y` is `x1`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `b` is a non-negative integer, the GCD of `a` and `b` is `gcd_val`, `x1` and `y1` are the coefficients such that `gcd_val = x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`, `y` is `x1`**
