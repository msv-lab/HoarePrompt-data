To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
  - \( m \) is 0
  - `queue` is the original queue with its first element possibly updated and removed plus the tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)`
  - `current_platform` and `steps` are the platform and steps from the first element of the updated `queue`
  - `visited` includes `next_state`
  - `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary
  - `next_state` is `next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H`
  - If `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `next_state` is added to `queue` and `levels[current_platform]` is updated if necessary. If `next_state` is already in `visited`, no change is made to the `queue` and `levels`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for next_platform in graph[current_platform]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - The variable `next_platform` is initialized to each platform in `graph[current_platform]` during each iteration of the loop.
   - Since we don't know the exact values of the variables at the start of the current iteration, we need to assume that the first element of the `queue` was just processed and `next_platform` is now being evaluated.

2. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - **`queue`:** At the start of the next iteration, the `queue` should include the new elements added during the current iteration. Specifically, if `next_state` (which is derived from the current `next_platform`) is not in `visited`, it will be added to the `queue` along with the updated `levels[current_platform]`.
   - **`current_platform` and `steps`:** These will be updated to reflect the new `next_platform` and the incremented steps.
   - **`visited`:** This set remains unchanged as the loop only adds new states to the queue if they are not already visited.
   - **`levels`:** If `next_state` is not in `visited`, `levels[next_platform]` might be updated based on the new path length.

3. **Specific States to Update:**
   - `queue` will now contain the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` was not in `visited`.
   - `current_platform` will be updated to the new `next_platform`.
   - `steps` will be incremented by 1.

### Conclusion:
State: **`m` is 0, `queue` includes the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` was not in `visited`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `visited` remains the same, and `levels[next_platform]` is updated if necessary.**

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
```
State: **`m` is 0, `queue` includes the new tuple `(next_platform, steps + 1)` if `next_state` was not in `visited`, `current_platform` is `next_platform`, `steps` is incremented by 1, `visited` remains the same, and `levels[next_platform]` is updated if necessary.**
