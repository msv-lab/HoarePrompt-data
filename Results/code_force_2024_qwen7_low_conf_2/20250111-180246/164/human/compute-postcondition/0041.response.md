The code `current_platform, steps = queue.popleft()` removes the first element from the `queue` and assigns it to `current_platform` and `steps`. This impacts the `queue` by removing its first element and updates `current_platform` and `steps` with the values from the removed element.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed, `current_platform` is the first element's platform from `queue`, `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`, `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.**
