Postcondition: ***`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed. If `next_state` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is updated to include `(next_platform, steps + 1)`. `current_platform` and `steps` remain as the first element's platform and steps from `queue`, `visited` includes `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`. If `next_state` is in `visited`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
