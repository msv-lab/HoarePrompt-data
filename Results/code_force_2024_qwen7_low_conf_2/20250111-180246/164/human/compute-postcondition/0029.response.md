The code appends a tuple containing `next_platform` and `steps + 1` to the `queue`. The `steps` variable currently holds a value of 2, so `steps + 1` will be 3. The `next_platform` variable's value remains unchanged. The `queue` variable, which was either `deque([(next_p_val, 3)])` if a valid `next_p_val` is found, or `deque([])` if no valid `next_p_val` is found, will now contain the new tuple.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([(`next_platform`, 3)]) if a valid `next_platform` is found, or deque([]) if no valid `next_platform` is found, `visited` includes the state `(next_p_val, (level_val + change_val) % H)`, `current_platform` is the same as before, `steps` is 2.**
