The function `func_1(b % a, a)` is called, which computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b % a` and `a` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This function returns three values: `gcd_val`, `x1`, and `y1`. The value of `gcd_val` is the GCD of `b % a` and `a`, while `x1` and `y1` are the coefficients satisfying the equation `gcd_val = x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a`.

Since the GCD of `a` and `b` was computed using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm before this line of code, and now we are computing the GCD of `b % a` and `a`, the value of `gcd_val` will be the same as the original GCD of `a` and `b`. However, the values of `x1` and `y1` will be different from the original coefficients `x` and `y` because they are calculated for the new pair `(b % a, a)`.

Given the initial conditions, the only changes are in the values of `x1` and `y1`, and the GCD is preserved. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `b` is a non-negative integer, the GCD of `a` and `b` is `gcd_val`, `x1` and `y1` are the coefficients such that `gcd_val = x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a**
