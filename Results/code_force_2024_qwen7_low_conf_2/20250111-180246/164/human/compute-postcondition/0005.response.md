The code updates the value of `x` based on the existing values of `x1` and `b // a * x1`. Let's break it down:

- The initial state has `a` as a non-negative integer greater than 0, `b` as a non-negative integer, `gcd_val` as the GCD of `a` and `b`, and `x1` and `y1` are the coefficients such that `gcd_val = x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a`.

- The new value of `x` is calculated as `y1 - b // a * x1`.

Since `b // a` gives the quotient when `b` is divided by `a`, the term `b // a * x1` represents a multiple of `x1`. 

Thus, the new value of `x` is `y1 - (b // a) * x1`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `b` is a non-negative integer, the GCD of `a` and `b` is `gcd_val`, `x1` and `y1` are the coefficients such that `gcd_val = x1 * (b % a) + y1 * a, `x` is `y1 - b // a * x1`**
