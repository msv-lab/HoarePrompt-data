Postcondition: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is the original queue with its first element removed, `current_platform` is the first element's platform from `queue`, `steps` is the first element's steps from `queue`, `visited` is a set of all valid `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited, `levels[current_platform]` is `(levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`, `next_platform` is a valid next platform such that `levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]`, `next_state` is `(next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)`, and the current state satisfies `next_state not in visited`**
