The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(0, 0)`. This tuple consists of two elements: the first element is `0`, which could represent a node index, and the second element is `0`, which could represent some additional information like the distance from the starting node.

Given the initial state where `graph` is a list of `n` lists, each containing indices of nodes connected by edges, and if `m` is 0, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists, the variable `queue` is updated with the specified tuple. The values of `graph` and `m` remain unchanged as no operation directly modifies them in this code snippet.

Output State: **`graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is deque([(0, 0)])**
