The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where `a` > 0. It returns either the original value of `b` along with 0 and 1, or the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, and the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. If `a` is 0, the function returns `b`, 0, and 1 directly. Otherwise, it recursively computes the gcd and the coefficients using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. The final state of the program is that it provides the gcd of `a` and `b`, and the BÃ©zout coefficients `x` and `y` that satisfy the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)` unless `a` is 0, in which case it simply returns `b`, 0, and 1.
