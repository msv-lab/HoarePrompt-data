num_platforms is an integer such that 2 ≤ num_platforms ≤ 10^5, num_passages is an integer such that 1 ≤ num_passages ≤ 10^5, max_level is an integer such that 1 ≤ max_level ≤ 10^9, levels is a list of num_platforms integers where each integer is in the range [0, H-1], changes is a list of num_platforms integers where each integer is in the range [0, H-1], and passages is a list of num_passages tuples, where each tuple contains two integers representing the indices (1-based) of the platforms connected by a passage.
