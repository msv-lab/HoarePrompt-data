t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and H are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ H ≤ 10^9. levels is a list of n integers representing the initial levels of each platform, where 0 ≤ levels[i] ≤ H-1 for all i. changes is a list of n integers representing the change of level for each platform, where 0 ≤ changes[i] ≤ H-1 for all i. passages is a list of m pairs of integers representing the passages between platforms, where each pair (a, b) indicates a passage between platforms a and b, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n.
