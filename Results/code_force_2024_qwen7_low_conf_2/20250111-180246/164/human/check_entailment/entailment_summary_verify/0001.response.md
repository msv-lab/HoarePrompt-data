### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of steps to move from platform 1 to platform \( n \) in a labyrinth where the level of each platform changes after each step. The movement is restricted to platforms at the same level.

2. **Graph Representation**: The program correctly initializes a graph using adjacency lists to represent the connections between platforms.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS approach is used to explore possible moves. This ensures that the shortest path (in terms of the number of steps) is found, as BFS explores nodes level by level.

4. **Level Update**: The program correctly updates the level of the current platform after each step using the formula \( l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H \).

5. **Visited States**: The visited set is used to keep track of states, which helps in avoiding cycles and redundant visits. This prevents the algorithm from getting stuck in an infinite loop.

6. **Return Values**: The function `func_1` returns `-1` if it is not possible to reach platform \( n \), which is the correct behavior as per the problem statement.

7. **Main Program Logic**: The main part of the program processes each test case independently and prints the result for each test case.

Given these points, the program logic and implementation align with the problem requirements. The BFS approach ensures that the shortest path is found, and the handling of levels and visited states is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
