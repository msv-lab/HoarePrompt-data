You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a game where you need to move through a labyrinth. The labyrinth
consists of n platforms, connected by m passages.

Each platform is at some level l_i , an integer number from 0 to H - 1 . In a
single step, if you are currently on platform i , you can stay on it, or move
to another platform j . To move to platform j they have to be connected by the
passage, and their levels have to be the same, namely l_i = l_j .

After each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform
i is calculated as l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H , for all i .

You start on platform 1 . Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to
platform n .

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and H (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m \le 10^5 , 1 \le H \le 10^9 ).

The second line contains n integers l_i , the initial level of each platform
(0 \le l_i \le H-1 ).

The third line contains n integers s_i , the change of level for each platform
(0 \le s_i \le H-1 ).

Next m lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described
as a pair of integers — the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at
most one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage
connecting a platform to itself.

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^5 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed
to get from platform 1 to platform n .

If it is impossible to get to platform n , print -1 .

Note

This is how levels of the platforms change, and what actions we need to
perform in the first example.

| Platform 1| Platform 2| Platform 3| Action  
---|---|---|---|---  
Step 1| 1| 9| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 2| 3| 2| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 3| 5| 5| 4| Move to the platform 2  
Step 4| 7| 8| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 5| 9| 1| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 6| 1| 4| 4| Move to the platform 3

- Program:
from collections import deque

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, H) = map(int, input().split())
    levels = list(map(int, input().split()))
    changes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    passages = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    result = func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (u, v) in passages:
        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
        graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    visited = set([(0, levels[0])])
    while queue:
        (current_platform, steps) = queue.popleft()
        if current_platform == n - 1:
            return steps
        for next_platform in graph[current_platform]:
            if levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]:
                next_state = (next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[next_platform]) % H)
                if next_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_state)
                    queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))
        levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H
    return -1



- Function Summary: 
- The annotation mentions four possible return cases, but the code only directly returns `-1` in one case. The other cases are implied through the BFS logic and the handling of the queue. The code ensures that if a path is found, it correctly handles the return values based on the steps taken and the first element in the queue.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to find the minimum number of steps required to move from platform 1 to platform n in a labyrinth.
2. It correctly initializes a graph to represent the connections between platforms.
3. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible moves, ensuring that it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.
4. The BFS ensures that it only moves to platforms with the same current level and updates the level of the current platform after each step.
5. The visited set keeps track of visited states, which is crucial to avoid revisiting the same state and getting into an infinite loop.
6. The function `func_1` returns `-1` if it's not possible to reach platform n, which is the correct behavior as per the problem statement.
7. The main part of the program processes each test case independently and prints the result for each test case.

Given these points, the program logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.
