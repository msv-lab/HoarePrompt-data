### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Initialization and BFS Setup:**
   - The program correctly initializes a graph using the `passages` information, creating a list of adjacency lists.
   - It then sets up a BFS queue with the starting platform (0, 0) and a visited set to keep track of visited states.

2. **BFS Execution:**
   - During the BFS execution, the program checks if the current platform is the target platform (n-1). If so, it returns the number of steps taken.
   - For each valid move (same level), it calculates the new level of the next platform and checks if this state has been visited before adding it to the queue.
   - After exploring all neighbors, it updates the level of the current platform.

3. **Level Update:**
   - The level update logic ensures that the levels of platforms change correctly according to the problem statement.
   - This update happens after checking the current state and before moving to the next platform.

4. **Handling Infinite Loops and Unreachable Platforms:**
   - The use of a visited set prevents revisiting the same state, thus avoiding infinite loops.
   - If the BFS completes without finding the target platform, it correctly returns -1.

5. **Test Case Processing:**
   - The program processes each test case independently and prints the result for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no passages exist (`m` is 0) correctly by initializing an empty graph.
   - It also handles cases where the target platform is unreachable, returning -1 as required.

Given the detailed analysis of the annotated code and the BFS approach used, the original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and its alignment with the problem requirements.

### Final:
**True**

The given program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
