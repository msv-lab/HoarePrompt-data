Reasoning:

1. **Graph Construction**: The code correctly constructs a graph using the given passages.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS is implemented properly to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n under the given constraints. It checks for level equality and processes nodes accordingly.
3. **State Representation**: Each state in the BFS queue is represented as `(current_platform, current_level)`, which ensures that the BFS correctly handles the periodic level changes.
4. **Visited Set**: The visited set keeps track of states that have already been processed to avoid revisiting them, ensuring correctness in handling cycles and redundant states.
5. **Edge Cases**: The BFS will naturally handle the case where it's impossible to reach platform n because the queue will eventually empty without finding the target.
6. **Level Update**: The level update logic `(levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H)` is correctly applied before processing the next state in the queue.
7. **Return Value**: The function correctly returns the minimum number of steps needed to reach platform n, or -1 if it's impossible.

Given these points, the implementation follows the requirements and constraints specified in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
