Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the passages information.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS is used to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform n. The BFS ensures that the minimum number of steps is found.
3. **Level Updates**: The levels of the platforms are updated according to the rules specified in the problem description.
4. **Visited Set**: A set is used to keep track of visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times, which helps in correctly handling the changing levels.

Given these points, the program should handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Since there are no obvious logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle, the program is considered correct.
