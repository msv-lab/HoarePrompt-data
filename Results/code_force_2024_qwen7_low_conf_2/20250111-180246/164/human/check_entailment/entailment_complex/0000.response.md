Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes variables for each test case, including the number of platforms (`n`), the number of passages (`m`), and the height (`H`). It also correctly reads the initial levels and changes for each platform, and the passages connecting the platforms.

2. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs a graph representing the connections between platforms using the provided passages. This is done correctly with each edge in the graph representing a passage between two platforms of the same level.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: The BFS algorithm is used to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform `n`. The BFS maintains a queue of states, where each state consists of the current platform index and its current level. The BFS ensures that each state is processed only once by keeping track of visited states using a set. 

4. **Level Update and State Transition**: For each state in the queue, the program checks if moving to a connected platform of the same level would lead to a valid path. If so, it updates the state and adds it to the queue. After processing all states in the current level, the levels of platforms are updated according to the rules given in the problem statement.

5. **Termination Condition**: The BFS correctly terminates when it either reaches platform `n` or exhausts all possible paths without finding platform `n`. If platform `n` is reached, the function returns the number of steps taken. If no path is found, the function correctly returns `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
