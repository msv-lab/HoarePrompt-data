You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a game where you need to move through a labyrinth. The labyrinth
consists of n platforms, connected by m passages.

Each platform is at some level l_i , an integer number from 0 to H - 1 . In a
single step, if you are currently on platform i , you can stay on it, or move
to another platform j . To move to platform j they have to be connected by the
passage, and their levels have to be the same, namely l_i = l_j .

After each step, the levels of all platforms change. The new level of platform
i is calculated as l'_i = (l_i + s_i) \bmod H , for all i .

You start on platform 1 . Find the minimum number of steps you need to get to
platform n .

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and H (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m \le 10^5 , 1 \le H \le 10^9 ).

The second line contains n integers l_i , the initial level of each platform
(0 \le l_i \le H-1 ).

The third line contains n integers s_i , the change of level for each platform
(0 \le s_i \le H-1 ).

Next m lines contain a description of the passages. Each passage is described
as a pair of integers — the platforms, connected by the passage. There is at
most one passage connecting each pair of platforms, and there is no passage
connecting a platform to itself.

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^5 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum number of steps needed
to get from platform 1 to platform n .

If it is impossible to get to platform n , print -1 .

Note

This is how levels of the platforms change, and what actions we need to
perform in the first example.

| Platform 1| Platform 2| Platform 3| Action  
---|---|---|---|---  
Step 1| 1| 9| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 2| 3| 2| 4| Stay on the platform 1  
Step 3| 5| 5| 4| Move to the platform 2  
Step 4| 7| 8| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 5| 9| 1| 4| Stay on the platform 2  
Step 6| 1| 4| 4| Move to the platform 3
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
from collections import deque

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, H) = map(int, input().split())
    levels = list(map(int, input().split()))
    changes = list(map(int, input().split()))
    passages = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    result = func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages)
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and H are positive integers, m is a non-negative integer, levels and changes are lists of n integers each, and passages is a list of m pairs of integers. The levels and changes lists index into platform indices from 0 to n-1, and each pair in passages represents a bidirectional passage between two platforms.
def func_1(n, m, H, levels, changes, passages):
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (u, v) in passages:
        graph[u - 1].append(v - 1)
        
        graph[v - 1].append(u - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `graph` is a list of `n` lists where each `graph[i]` contains all indices `j` such that there is an edge between node `i+1` and node `j+1` in the `passages` list. If `m` is 0, `graph` is a list of `n` empty lists.
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    visited = set([(0, levels[0])])
    while queue:
        current_platform, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_platform == n - 1:
            return steps
        
        for next_platform in graph[current_platform]:
            if levels[current_platform] == levels[next_platform]:
                next_state = next_platform, (levels[next_platform] + changes[
                    next_platform]) % H
                if next_state not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_state)
                    queue.append((next_platform, steps + 1))
        
        levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[
            current_platform]) % H
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `graph` is a list of `n` lists, `m` is 0, `queue` is empty, `visited` is a set containing all unique `(platform, level)` pairs that have been visited, `current_platform` is undefined, `steps` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `levels` is a dictionary where each key is a platform index and the value is `(levels[platform] + changes[platform]) % H` for that platform.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
