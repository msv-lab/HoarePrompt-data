Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input as specified, parsing `t`, `n`, `m`, `H`, the initial levels of the platforms, the level changes for each platform, and the passages between platforms.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The program constructs a graph representing the passages between platforms, ensuring that each passage is bidirectional.
   - This step is correctly implemented with the `graph` list where each entry is a list of adjacent nodes.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - The BFS is used to find the shortest path from platform 1 to platform `n`.
   - The BFS maintains a queue of tuples containing the current platform index and the number of steps taken so far.
   - A set `visited` keeps track of visited `(platform, level)` pairs to ensure that the program doesn't revisit states unnecessarily.

4. **Level Update:**
   - The levels of the platforms are updated according to the problem description using the formula `levels[current_platform] = (levels[current_platform] + changes[current_platform]) % H`.
   - This update is done within the BFS loop, ensuring that the levels are correctly recalculated before checking the next state.

5. **Condition Check and Early Termination:**
   - The program checks if the current platform is the target platform `n - 1` and returns the number of steps if true.
   - If the BFS completes without reaching the target platform, it returns `-1`.

6. **Handling of Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the condition where the levels must be equal for a move to be possible.
   - It ensures that only valid transitions (where the levels match) are considered in the BFS.

Given these points, the program adheres to the problem description accurately. It uses BFS to find the shortest path and correctly updates the levels of the platforms as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
