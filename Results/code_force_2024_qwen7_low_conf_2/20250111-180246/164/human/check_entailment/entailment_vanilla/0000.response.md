Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to find the minimum number of steps required to move from platform 1 to platform n in a labyrinth.
2. It correctly initializes a graph to represent the connections between platforms.
3. It uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible moves, ensuring that it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of steps.
4. The BFS ensures that it only moves to platforms with the same current level and updates the level of the current platform after each step.
5. The visited set keeps track of visited states, which is crucial to avoid revisiting the same state and getting into an infinite loop.
6. The function `func_1` returns `-1` if it's not possible to reach platform n, which is the correct behavior as per the problem statement.
7. The main part of the program processes each test case independently and prints the result for each test case.

Given these points, the program logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
