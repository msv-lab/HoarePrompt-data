The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \), followed by two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It then sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order. After sorting, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of \( a \) and \( b \) (considering cyclic shifts if necessary) and prints the result. The function does not return any value.
