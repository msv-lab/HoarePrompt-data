You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        b.sort(reverse=True)
        diff = 0
        for i in range(n):
            diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))
        print(diff)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \), followed by two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It then sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order. After sorting, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of \( a \) and \( b \) (considering cyclic shifts if necessary) and prints the result. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum total difference \(D\) as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the line `diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` is incorrect. It should simply be `diff += abs(a[i] - b[i])` to ensure that the difference between corresponding elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\) is maximized.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following inputs:
- \(n = 4\), \(m = 6\)
- Array \(a = [6, 1, 2, 4]\)
- Array \(b = [3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3]\)

The correct solution would involve selecting the largest possible values from \(b\) to maximize the differences:
- For \(a[0] = 6\), the best choice from \(b\) is 7, so the difference is \(|6 - 7| = 1\).
- For \(a[1] = 1\), the best choice from \(b\) is 5, so the difference is \(|1 - 5| = 4\).
- For \(a[2] = 2\), the best choice from \(b\) is 3, so the difference is \(|2 - 3| = 1\).
- For \(a[3] = 4\), the best choice from \(b\) is 7, so the difference is \(|4 - 7| = 3\).

Thus, the correct total difference \(D\) should be \(1 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 9\).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the difference using the line `diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`, which leads to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
