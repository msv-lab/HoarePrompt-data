Reasoning:
The given program aims to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) between Petya's array \(a\) and Vasya's chosen array \(c\). To achieve this, the program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths \(n\) and \(m\) of Petya’s array \(a\) and Vasya’s array \(b\).
3. It then reads the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).
4. Both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) are sorted. Array \(a\) is sorted in ascending order, and array \(b\) is sorted in descending order.
5. It initializes a variable `diff` to store the total difference.
6. It iterates through the first \(n\) elements of both sorted arrays. For each pair \((a[i], b[i])\), it calculates the maximum of the absolute differences \(|a[i] - b[i]|\) and \(|a[n-i-1] - b[n-i-1]|\) and adds this value to `diff`.
7. Finally, it prints the total difference `diff`.

This approach ensures that for each element in Petya’s array, Vasya selects the element from the sorted array \(b\) that maximizes the difference, either from the beginning or the end of the sorted array \(b\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible total difference \(D\).

Correctness: **True**
