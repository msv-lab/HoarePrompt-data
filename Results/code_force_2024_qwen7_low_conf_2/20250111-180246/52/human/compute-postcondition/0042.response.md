According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n`. However, since `i` starts from `n - 1`, incrementing `i` by 1 will make it equal to `n`. For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 1 because `i` will then be equal to `n`, and the loop condition `i < n` will still hold true.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- `i` will be `n`.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value**
