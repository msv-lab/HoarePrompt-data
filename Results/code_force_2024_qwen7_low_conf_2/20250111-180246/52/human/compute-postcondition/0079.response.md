The code snippet sorts the list `arr1`. This means that `arr1` will be arranged in ascending order. The other variables (`arr2`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input, and now it will be sorted in ascending order.
2. `arr2` remains unchanged.
3. `s1` remains unchanged.
4. `s2` remains unchanged.
5. `e1` remains unchanged.
6. `e2` remains unchanged.
7. `d` remains unchanged.
8. `i` remains unchanged.

The sorted list of `arr1` will be the new value of `arr1`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a new list of integers obtained from input, `s1` is `input_n - 1`, `s2` is `input_m - 1`, `e1` is `0`, `e2` is `0`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[input_m-1]|, |arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is `2`**
