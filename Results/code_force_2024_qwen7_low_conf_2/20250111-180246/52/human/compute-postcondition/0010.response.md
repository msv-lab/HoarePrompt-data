Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `diff` has been updated based on `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`.
   - `a` and `b` are lists.
   - `i` is an index within the lists.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the loop starts the next iteration. This means we should consider the value of `i` after the previous iteration.

4. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - Let's assume `i` was at the highest value it took in the previous iteration, which would be `i = n - 1` (the last value).

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `0` and the loop will start again.
   - Since `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now become `0` for the next iteration.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains the same as it is a positive integer.
   - `diff` will be updated based on the new `i` value, which is `0` now.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not modified inside the loop.

7. **State Adjustment**:
   - `i` will be `0` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `diff` will be updated based on the new `i` value.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `diff` will be updated based on `max(abs(a[0] - b[0]), abs(a[0 - n] - b[0 - n]))`; `a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 0.**
