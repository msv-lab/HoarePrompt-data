The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in descending order. Before the sort, `b` is equal to `b_new`. Since no specific values are given for `b_new`, we know that `b` will be sorted in reverse order of its original values. However, we do not know the specific values of `b_new`, so we will represent `b` after sorting as `b_new.sort(reverse=True)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` has been printed, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order (equal to `b_new.sort(reverse=True)`)**
