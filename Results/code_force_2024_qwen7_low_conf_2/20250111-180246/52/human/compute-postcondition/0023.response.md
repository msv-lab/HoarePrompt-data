To ensure the loop can execute, we need to determine the necessary conditions for the variables involved in the loop.

1. The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and runs according to the range defined by `n`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial value of `i` is 0, but the loop will start with `i` being 0 and increment `i` until it is less than `n`.

Given these points:

- `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `i` will start as 0 and will increment during each iteration, so initially, `i` is 0.

Since the initial values of `m`, `diff`, `a`, and `b` do not directly impact the ability of the loop to execute, they do not need to be explicitly adjusted unless the problem specifies additional constraints (which it does not in this case).

Thus, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
