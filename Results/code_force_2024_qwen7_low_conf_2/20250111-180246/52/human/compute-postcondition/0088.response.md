`s2` is incremented by 1. The value of `s2` was initially `0`, so now `s2` is `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`, `s1` is 1, `e1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is 1, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 2**
