The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `b`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `diff`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Let's denote the new list of integers input by the user as `b_new`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` has been printed, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers equal to `b_new`**
