Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m-2]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[1])**, and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 5.
