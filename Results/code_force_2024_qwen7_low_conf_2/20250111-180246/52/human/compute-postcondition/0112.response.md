Output State: **`cases` is a positive integer (1 ≤ cases ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all values calculated as `max(sum1, sum2)` in each iteration, where `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])` and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, and `d` is printed.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `cases` times, and in each iteration, the values of `n` and `m` are determined from user input.
- After processing each pair of lists (`arr1` and `arr2`), the values of `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2` are adjusted.
- Once the loop completes, `s1` and `s2` reach their final positions (`n-1` and `m-1` respectively), and `e1` and `e2` both become 0.
- The variable `d` accumulates the sum of the maximum values of the expressions `sum1` and `sum2` over all iterations.
- Finally, the total value of `d` is printed after all iterations are completed.
