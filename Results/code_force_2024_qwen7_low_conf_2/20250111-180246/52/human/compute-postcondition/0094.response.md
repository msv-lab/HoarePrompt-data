The value of `d` is incremented by `max(sum1, sum2)`. Since `sum1` and `sum2` are already defined, `d` will be updated to its current value plus the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`.

Given the initial state:
- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`
- `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`

After executing `d += max(sum1, sum2)`, `d` becomes `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is 1, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 2**
