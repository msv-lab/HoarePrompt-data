State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `t` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will only execute if `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is within the range of 1 to 100, it inherently guarantees that `t` is greater than 0.
- Therefore, the primary adjustment needed is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0, which it already is given the specified range.

Thus, the final state required for the loop to execute is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `t` must be greater than 0**
