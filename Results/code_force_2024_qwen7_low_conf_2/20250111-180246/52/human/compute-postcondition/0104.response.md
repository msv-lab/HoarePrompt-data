`s2` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s2` is equal to `sum2`, which is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`. After incrementing by 1, the new value of `s2` will be `sum2 + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `d` is `3 * (abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3]))`, `i` is `2`, `s1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3]) + 1`, `s2` is `sum2 + 1`**
