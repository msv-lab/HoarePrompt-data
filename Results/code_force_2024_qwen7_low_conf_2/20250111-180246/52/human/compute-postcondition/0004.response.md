`b` is assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged. The input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
