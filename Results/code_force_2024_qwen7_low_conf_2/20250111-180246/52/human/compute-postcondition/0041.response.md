The given code snippet updates the variable `diff` by adding the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` to its current value. Let's analyze the impact of this code step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet `diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` is executed.
   - Here, `i` is `n - 1`, so `a[i]` is `a[n - 1]` and `b[i]` is `b[n - 1]`.
   - Also, `i - n` is `(n - 1) - n = -1`, so `a[i - n]` is `a[-1]` and `b[i - n]` is `b[-1]`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value.
   - The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the output state after running the code snippet is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n - 1`; `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value.**
