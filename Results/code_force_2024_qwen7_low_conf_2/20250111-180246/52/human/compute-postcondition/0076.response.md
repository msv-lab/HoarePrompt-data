The input code reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. This means that the initial values of `arr1` and `arr2`, and the values of `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged.

The initial state of the variables is:
- `arr1` is a sorted list of integers
- `arr2` is a sorted list of integers
- `s1` is `n - 1`
- `s2` is `m - 1`
- `e1` is `0`
- `e2` is `0`
- `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[n-1] - arr2[m-1]|, |arr1[n-1] - arr2[0]|)`
- `i` is `2`

After executing the line `n, m = [int(a) for a in input().split()]`, the values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers read from the input. However, since the actual values of `n` and `m` are not provided in this context, they will be referred to as `input_n` and `input_m` respectively.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is `input_n - 1`, `s2` is `input_m - 1`, `e1` is `0`, `e2` is `0`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[input_m-1]|, |arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is `2`**
