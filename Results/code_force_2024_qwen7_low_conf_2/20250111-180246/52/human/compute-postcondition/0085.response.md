The code initializes `sum2` to the value of `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`. Given the initial states:
- `s1` is 0
- `e1` is `n - 1`
- `s2` is 0
- `e2` is `m - 1`

We substitute these values into the expression:
- `sum1` is initially `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`
- `s1` is 0
- `e1` is `n - 1`
- `s2` is 0
- `e2` is `m - 1`

Thus, `sum2` becomes:
- `sum2 = abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`

This is exactly the same as `sum1`. Therefore, the value of `sum2` is equal to `sum1`.

The states of the other variables (`s1`, `e1`, `s2`, `e2`, `d`, and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`, `s1` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is 0, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is 0, `i` is 2**
