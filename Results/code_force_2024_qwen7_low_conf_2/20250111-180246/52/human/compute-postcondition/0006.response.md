The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in descending order. The lists `a` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and is sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input and now sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and is sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input and now sorted in descending order**
