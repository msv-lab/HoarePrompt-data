`e2` is decremented by 1. The value of `e1` was decreased by 1 in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. All other variables are unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `d` is `3 * (abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3]))`, `i` is `2`, `s1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3]) + 1`, `s2` is `sum2 + 1`, and `e2` is decreased by 1.**
