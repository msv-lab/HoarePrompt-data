To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions of the `while` loop and the current state after the previous iteration.

### Given Information:
- The `while` loop condition is `s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.
- The current state after the previous iteration is:
  - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers
  - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers
  - `s1` is 1
  - `s2` is 1
  - `e1` is `n - 2`
  - `e2` is `m - 2`
  - `d` is `d + sum2`
  - `i` is 1
  - `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop continues as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`.

2. **Current Values**:
   - `s1` is 1
   - `s2` is 1
   - `e1` is `n - 2`
   - `e2` is `m - 2`

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` must hold true.
   - Currently, `s1` is 1 and `e1` is `n - 2`, so `s1 < e1` is true (since 1 is less than `n - 2`).
   - Similarly, `s2` is 1 and `e2` is `m - 2`, so `s2 < e2` is true (since 1 is less than `m - 2`).

Since both conditions are already satisfied, the loop will continue to execute. No adjustments to the states are necessary because the loop can definitely execute one more time given the current values.

### Output State:
No adjustments are needed in the state for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]`**
