The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since the initial state includes that `a` is a list of integers input by the user, after sorting, the elements in `a` will be arranged in non-decreasing order. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` has been printed, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list of integers equal to `b_new`**
