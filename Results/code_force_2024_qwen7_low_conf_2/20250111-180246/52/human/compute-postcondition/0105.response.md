The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. However, in the initial state, `e1` is not mentioned, and no value or reference to `e1` is given. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `e1` after the operation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3])`, `d` is `3 * (abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3]))`, `i` is `2`, `s1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[m - 3]) + 1`, `s2` is `sum2 + 1`, and `e1` is decreased by 1.**
