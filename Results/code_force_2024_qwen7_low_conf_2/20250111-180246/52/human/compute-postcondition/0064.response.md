Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes the following variables and their values:
   - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers
   - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers
   - `s1` is 2
   - `s2` is 2
   - `e1` is `n - 3`
   - `e2` is `m - 3`
   - `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`
   - `i` is 1
   - `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`
   - `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m-2]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[1])`

2. The code snippet updates `sum2` as follows:
   ```python
   sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])
   ```
   Given the initial values of `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2`:
   - `s1` is 2
   - `s2` is 2
   - `e1` is `n - 3`
   - `e2` is `m - 3`

   Substituting these into the equation for `sum2`, we get:
   ```python
   sum2 = abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m - 3]) + abs(arr1[n - 3] - arr2[2])
   ```

3. The only change made by the code is to the value of `sum2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `arr1` is a sorted list of integers
- `arr2` is a sorted list of integers
- `s1` is 2
- `s2` is 2
- `e1` is `n - 3`
- `e2` is `m - 3`
- `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`
- `i` is 1
- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m-3]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[2])`

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m-3]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[2])**
