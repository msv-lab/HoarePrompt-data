The code `print(diff)` simply prints the value of `diff`. It does not change the value of `diff` or any other variables. Therefore, the value of `diff` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[n-1-i] - b[n-1-i]))` for all valid indices `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and `i` is `n-1`. The value of `diff` is printed.**
