Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \), followed by two lists of integers \( a \) and \( b \). It then sorts \( a \) in ascending order and \( b \) in descending order. After sorting, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of \( a \) and \( b \) (considering cyclic shifts if necessary) and prints the result. The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If \( n = 0 \), the inner loop will not execute, and the function will still process the next test case.
- If \( t = 0 \), no test cases will be processed, and the function will terminate without printing anything.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that `diff` is the sum of the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. However, the code only considers `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and does not include `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. Therefore, the current implementation does not account for the cyclic shift consideration mentioned in the annotation.
