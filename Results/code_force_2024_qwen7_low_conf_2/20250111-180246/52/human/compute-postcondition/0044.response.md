Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer (though not used in the loop, so we ignore it for now).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `diff` is 0.
- `t` is a positive integer (though not used in the loop, so we ignore it for now).
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order (`b_new.sort(reverse=True)`).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))
```

### Analysis of the Loop:
1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `n` times, with `i` taking values from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` to its current value.

2. **Final Values After Loop Completion**:
   - After `i` goes through all values from `0` to `n-1`, the loop will have completed `n` iterations.
   - The final value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The final value of `diff` will be the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`, considering the wrapping around the list indices using modulo arithmetic (`a[i - n]`).

### Determining the Output State:
- **Variables after loop completion**:
  - `n`: The original value of `n` remains unchanged.
  - `i`: The final value of `i` will be `n-1`.
  - `diff`: The final value of `diff` will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the entire list length `n`.

### Output State:
- The loop will execute exactly `n` times, as required by the condition in the loop.
- The final value of `i` will be `n-1`.
- The final value of `diff` will be the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `b` for the entire list length `n`.

Thus, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
Output State: **`n` is the same as the input integer; `i` is `n-1`; `diff` is the sum of the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
