`s2` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s2` is `1`, so after the increment, `s2` becomes `2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is `2`, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is `2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `2`.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is `2`, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is `2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `2`**
