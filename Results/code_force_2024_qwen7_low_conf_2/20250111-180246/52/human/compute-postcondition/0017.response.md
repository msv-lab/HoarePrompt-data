The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `n` and `m`, we can only say that they are now assigned the values from the input. The values of `diff`, `a`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer input, `m` is assigned the second integer input, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[n-1-i] - b[n-1-i]))` for all valid indices `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and `t` must be greater than the current number of completed iterations + 1.**
