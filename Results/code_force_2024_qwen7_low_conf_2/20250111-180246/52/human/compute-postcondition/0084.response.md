The code calculates `sum1` as the sum of two absolute differences: `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2])` and `abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. Here, `s1` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is 0, and `e2` is `m - 1`. However, the actual values of `n`, `m`, `arr1`, and `arr2` are not provided, so we will keep them in their general form.

The variables `sum1`, `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, and `e2` are updated by the code. The values of `arr1`, `arr2`, `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, `e2`, and `i` are updated accordingly, while the other variables (`d`) remain unchanged.

- `sum1` is assigned the value `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`.
- `s1` remains 0.
- `e1` remains `n - 1`.
- `s2` remains 0.
- `e2` remains `m - 1`.
- `d` remains 0.
- `i` remains 2.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `s1` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is 0, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is 0, `i` is 2**
