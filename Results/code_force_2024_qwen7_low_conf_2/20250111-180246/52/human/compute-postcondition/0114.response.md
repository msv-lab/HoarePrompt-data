Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each case involves two arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function sorts both arrays and then calculates a value `d` by comparing elements from the start and end of each array. Specifically, for each pair of elements `(arr1[s1], arr2[s2])` and `(arr1[e1], arr2[e2])`, it computes two sums: `sum1 = |arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]| + |arr1[e1] - arr2[e2]|` and `sum2 = |arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]| + |arr1[e1] - arr2[s2]|`. It adds the maximum of these two sums to `d`. This process continues until `s1` equals `e1`. If `s1` equals `e1`, it adds the maximum of the remaining absolute differences between the corresponding elements. After processing all test cases, the function prints the total value `d` for each test case. The function handles edge cases where the indices `s1` and `e1` might meet during the loop.**

**Potential edge cases:**
- When `s1` equals `e1`, the function correctly adds the remaining absolute differences to `d`.

**Missing functionality:**
- The code does not explicitly handle cases where `n` or `m` are 1, although it implicitly handles these cases within the loop structure. However, the initial setup ensures that the loop conditions are met, so no additional handling is necessary.
