`a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` are not affected by this operation. After sorting, the list `a` will contain the same integers as before but in sorted order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and is sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
