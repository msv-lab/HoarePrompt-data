Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to `n`, but it cannot be incremented because it is already equal to `n - 1` and the loop condition requires `i < n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is already at `n - 1`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `n` is incremented by 1, making `i` less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to `n + 1`.

5. **New Values**:
   - `n` must now be `n + 1`.
   - `i` remains `n - 1` (which is now `n - 1`).

6. **Other Variables**:
   - The value of `diff` is updated based on the current values of `a` and `b`, but since the loop condition does not depend on `diff`, it remains unchanged.

So, the new state for the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value.**
