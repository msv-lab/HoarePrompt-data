`e2` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `m - 2` to `m - 3`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `sum1` remains `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`
- `sum2` remains `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`
- `s1` remains `2`
- `e1` remains `n - 3`
- `s2` remains `2`
- `e2` is now `m - 3`
- `d` remains `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`
- `i` remains `2`

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is `2`, `e1` is `n - 3`, `s2` is `2`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `2**
