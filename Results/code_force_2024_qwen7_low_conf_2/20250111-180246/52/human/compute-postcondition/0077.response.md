The code reads a list of integers from input and assigns it to `arr1`. This affects the value of `arr1`, converting it from a sorted list of integers to a list of integers obtained from input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is `input_n - 1`, `s2` is `input_m - 1`, `e1` is `0`, `e2` is `0`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[input_m-1]|, |arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is `2`**
