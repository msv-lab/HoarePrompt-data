Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `diff` is updated by `diff + max(abs(a[i - 1] - b[i - 1]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - Therefore, the condition `i < n` must still hold true for the next iteration, meaning `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` will become 3).

5. **Updating the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `diff` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is 3), but the exact update is not specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is updated by `diff + max(abs(a[2] - b[2]), abs(a[3 - n] - b[3 - n]))`**
