`n, m` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which splits the input string into two parts and converts them to integers. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` and `t > 0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**
