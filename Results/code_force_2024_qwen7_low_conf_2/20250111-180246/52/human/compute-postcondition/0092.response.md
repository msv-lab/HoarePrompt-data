The code snippet updates the value of `sum1` to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`. We need to calculate this new value based on the given initial state.

From the initial state:
- `s1` is 1
- `e1` is \( n - 2 \)
- `s2` is 1
- `e2` is \( m - 2 \)

So, the new value of `sum1` is:
\[ \text{sum1} = \text{abs}(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + \text{abs}(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2]) \]

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `sum2` remains as \( \text{abs}(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + \text{abs}(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]) \)
- `s1` is 1
- `e1` is \( n - 2 \)
- `s2` is 1
- `e2` is \( m - 2 \)
- `d` is \( \max(\text{sum1}, \text{sum2}) \)
- `i` is 2

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`, `s1` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is 1, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 2**
