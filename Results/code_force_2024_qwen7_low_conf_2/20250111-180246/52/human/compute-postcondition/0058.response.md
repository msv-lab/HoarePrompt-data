`s1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated values are: `arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is now 2, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 1, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2])`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 1, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2])**.
