Let's analyze the given conditions and the while loop to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`
- `s1` is `2`
- `e1` is `n - 3`
- `s2` is `2`
- `e2` is `m - 3`
- `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`
- `i` is `2`

### While Loop Condition:
```python
while s1 < e1 and s2 < e2:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop continues as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
     - `s1` is `2`
     - `e1` is `n - 3`
     - `s2` is `2`
     - `e2` is `m - 3`

2. **Ensuring the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For `s1 < e1` to be true in the next iteration, `s1` must be less than `e1`. Since `s1` is `2` and `e1` is `n - 3`, this condition is already satisfied because `2 < n - 3` (assuming `n > 5`).
   - For `s2 < e2` to be true in the next iteration, `s2` must be less than `e2`. Since `s2` is `2` and `e2` is `m - 3`, this condition is also already satisfied because `2 < m - 3` (assuming `m > 5`).

3. **No Adjustment Needed for `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, or `e2`**:
   - There is no need to adjust `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, or `e2` because they are already in a position where the loop can continue.

4. **Other States**:
   - The values of `sum1`, `sum2`, `d`, and `i` do not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, these values do not need to be adjusted.

### Conclusion:
Since the current values of `s1`, `e1`, `s2`, and `e2` already satisfy the loop condition, no adjustments are necessary.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is `2`, `e1` is `n - 3`, `s2` is `2`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `2`**
