`diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` to its current value. Given the initial state where `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and `diff` is updated by adding the maximum of `abs(a[n - 1] - b[n - 1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` to its current value, we can proceed as follows:

- Initially, `i` is `n`.
- The new `diff` is the old `diff` plus the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])`. Since `i` is `n`, this becomes `diff += max(abs(a[n] - b[n]), abs(a[0] - b[0]))`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is now `n`.
- `diff` is the original `diff` plus the maximum of `abs(a[n] - b[n])` and `abs(a[0] - b[0])`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `i` is `n`; `diff` is the original `diff` plus the maximum of `abs(a[n] - b[n])` and `abs(a[0] - b[0])`**
