Output State: **`s1` is `n - 1`, `e1` is 0, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all values calculated as `max(sum1, sum2)` in each iteration, where `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])` and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2`. Given the initial conditions and the decrement/increment operations inside the loop, `s1` and `s2` increase by 1 each iteration while `e1` and `e2` decrease by 1 each iteration.
- When `s1` equals `e1` and `s2` equals `e2`, the loop stops. This happens when both sublists are reduced to a single element.
- Each iteration calculates two sums (`sum1` and `sum2`) and adds the maximum of these sums to `d`.
- After all iterations, `s1` and `s2` will be equal to `n-1` and `m-1` respectively, and `e1` and `e2` will be 0.
- The final value of `d` will be the cumulative sum of all `max(sum1, sum2)` calculated in each iteration.
