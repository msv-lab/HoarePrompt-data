To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `diff` is 0.
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order (equal to `b_new.sort(reverse=True)`).

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n - 1`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must satisfy the condition `i < n` at the start of the loop.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `n > 0` for the loop to execute at least once.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `m`, `diff`, `t`, `a`, and `b` do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the provided information.

### Conclusion:
The key variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Final State:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
