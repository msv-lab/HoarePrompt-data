The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will take inputs from test cases where each test case consists of an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5), and lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but based on the provided constraints, it seems the function processes these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`, and lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. No explicit return value is specified.**
