The code `diff = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `diff`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input and is sorted in ascending order; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input and now sorted in descending order; `diff` is 0**
