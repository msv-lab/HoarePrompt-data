The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it implies that the function will take in multiple test cases, each containing integers `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. The constraints are as follows:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a_i` and `b_i` are integers where \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all `i`.

The output depends on the internal logic of the function, but based on the given constraints, the function will process these test cases and return some result for each test case. However, without further details on the exact output, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `t` test cases, each containing integers `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` with specified constraints, and returns results based on these inputs.**
