Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` is the sum of the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers where `a` is sorted in ascending order and `b` is sorted in descending order, and `diff` is printed after all iterations of the loop.**
