Let's go through the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers
   - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers
   - `s1` is 1
   - `s2` is 1
   - `e1` is `n - 2`
   - `e2` is `m - 2`
   - `d` is `d + sum2`
   - `i` is 1
   - `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`
   - `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2])`

2. Code:
   ```python
   sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])
   ```

3. Impact of the code:
   - The value of `sum2` is updated to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`.
   - Specifically, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`.

4. Calculation:
   - `sum2` now becomes `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2])**
