According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for each valid index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- `diff` has been printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`. Since `t` controls the number of iterations, if `t` is still a positive integer, the loop will execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))` for each valid index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, and `diff` has been printed, `t` must be a positive integer**
