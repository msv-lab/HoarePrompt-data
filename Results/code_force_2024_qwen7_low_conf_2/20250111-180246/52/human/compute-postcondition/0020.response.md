The code snippet `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since sorting a list changes its order but not its elements, the elements themselves remain the same. However, the order of the elements in `a` changes. Given the initial state, the only change is in the order of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[n-1-i] - b[n-1-i]))` for all valid indices `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `a` is sorted in ascending order, `b` is the new list of integers from the latest input**
