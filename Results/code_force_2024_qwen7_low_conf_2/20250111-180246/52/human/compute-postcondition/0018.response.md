The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input, converts each integer to an int, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, `diff`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `a` now contains the newly read integers.

Output State: **`n` is assigned the first integer input, `m` is assigned the second integer input, `diff` is the sum of `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[n-1-i] - b[n-1-i]))` for all valid indices `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, `a` is updated to contain the integers from the latest input, `b` remains unchanged**
