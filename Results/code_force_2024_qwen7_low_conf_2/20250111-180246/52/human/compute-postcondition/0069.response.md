The code `e2 -= 1` decrements `e2` by 1. The initial value of `e2` is `m - 3`. After decrementing, the new value of `e2` is `(m - 3) - 1` or `m - 4`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 3, `s2` is 3, `e1` is `n - 4`, `e2` is `m - 4`, `d` is `d + (abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3]))`, `i` is 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m-3]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[2])**
