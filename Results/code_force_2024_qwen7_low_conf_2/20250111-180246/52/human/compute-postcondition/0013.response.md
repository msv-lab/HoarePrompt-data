Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `diff` is updated to `diff + abs(a[0] - b[0])`
   - `a` and `b` are lists
   - `i` is 1

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   diff += max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))
   ```

3. Analyzing the code:
   - Since `i` is 1, `i - n` would be `1 - n`.
   - Given `n` is a positive integer, `1 - n` will be a negative number (e.g., if `n = 1`, then `1 - 1 = 0`; if `n = 2`, then `1 - 2 = -1`).
   - Accessing `a[1]` and `b[1]` is valid because list indices are zero-based, but `a[-1]` and `b[-1]` would access the last element of the lists `a` and `b`.

4. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
   ```python
   diff += max(abs(a[1] - b[1]), abs(a[-1] - b[-1]))
   ```
   - `abs(a[1] - b[1])` is the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`.
   - `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])` is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`.

5. Adding these two values to `diff`:
   - The new value of `diff` is the original value of `diff` plus the maximum of the two absolute differences.

6. Updating the variables:
   - `i` remains unchanged and is still 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `diff` is updated.

Given this, the final state of the variables is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `diff` is the original value of `diff` plus the maximum of `abs(a[1] - b[1])` and `abs(a[-1] - b[-1])`, `a` and `b` are lists, `i` is 1.**
