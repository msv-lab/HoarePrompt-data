Postcondition: ***`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[n-1] - arr2[m-1]|, |arr1[n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is 1. If `s1 == e1`, `d` is updated to `d + \max(|arr1[n-1] - arr2[m-1]|, |arr1[n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged if the condition `s1 == e1` is not met.***
