`d` is incremented by `max(sum1, sum2)`. The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are not directly mentioned in the code, but their definitions are given in the initial state. However, since `sum1` is not defined in the initial state, we only know about `sum2`.

From the initial state:
- `sum2` is defined as `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`

Since `sum1` is not defined, it is considered as 0 when calculating `max(sum1, sum2)`.

Therefore, `d` is updated to `d + max(0, sum2)`, which simplifies to `d + sum2`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])**
