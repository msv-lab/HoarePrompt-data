The code `d += max(sum1, sum2)` adds the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2` to `d`. Let's break down the values of `sum1` and `sum2` from the initial state:

- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m-3]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[2])`

Since `arr1` and `arr2` are sorted lists, and `n-3` and `m-3` are the last indices of their respective lists (assuming they are of length 5), we can infer the following:

- `arr1[2]` is the third element in `arr1`.
- `arr2[2]` is the third element in `arr2`.
- `arr1[n-3]` is the second last element in `arr1`.
- `arr2[m-3]` is the second last element in `arr2`.

The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are the same because the absolute differences are simply rearranged. Therefore, `max(sum1, sum2)` is just one of these sums.

Now, we add this maximum value to `d`:

- `d` was initially `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, which means `d` now becomes `d + max(abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3]), abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m-3]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[2]))`. Since `sum1` and `sum2` are identical, `max(sum1, sum2)` is just one of them.

Therefore, the updated value of `d` is `d + (abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3]))`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + (abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3]))`, `i` is 1, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[2]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[m-3])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[2] - arr2[m-3]) + abs(arr1[n-3] - arr2[2])**
