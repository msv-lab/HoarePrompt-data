`e2` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `e2` is `m - 1`, so the new value of `e2` is `(m - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `m - 2`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]`
