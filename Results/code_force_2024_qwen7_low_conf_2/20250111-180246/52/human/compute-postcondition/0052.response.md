The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. Given that `e1` was initially set to `n - 1`, after decrementing, `e1` will be `n - 2`. The value of `e1` is now updated, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]`**
