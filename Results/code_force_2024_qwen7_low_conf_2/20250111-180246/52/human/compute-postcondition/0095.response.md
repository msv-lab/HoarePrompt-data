`s1` is incremented by 1. The value of `s1` was initially `1`, so now `s1` is `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is `2`, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is `1`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `2`.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is `2`, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is `1`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `2 * max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is `2`**.
