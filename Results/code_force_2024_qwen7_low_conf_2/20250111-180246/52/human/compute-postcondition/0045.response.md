The code `print(diff)` prints the value of the variable `diff` without changing its value. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is the same as the input integer; `i` is `n-1`; `diff` is the sum of the maximum of `abs(a[i] - b[i])` and `abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n])` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
