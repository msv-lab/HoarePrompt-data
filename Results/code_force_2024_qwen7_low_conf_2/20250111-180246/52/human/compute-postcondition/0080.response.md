The code `arr2.sort()` sorts the list `arr2`. Since `arr2` was initially a new list of integers obtained from input, sorting it does not affect the original values of the elements in `arr2`. The other variables (`s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `arr2` after sorting.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted new list of integers obtained from input, `s1` is `input_n - 1`, `s2` is `input_m - 1`, `e1` is `0`, `e2` is `0`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[input_m-1]|, |arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is `2`**
