The code `e1 -= 1` decrements the value of `e1` by 1. Initially, `e1` is `n - 2`. After the decrement, the new value of `e1` will be `(n - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 1, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2])**
