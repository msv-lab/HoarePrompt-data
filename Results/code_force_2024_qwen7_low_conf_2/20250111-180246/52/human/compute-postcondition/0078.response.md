The code snippet initializes `arr2` as a list of integers obtained from user input, split into individual integers. This means that the previous value of `arr2` (which was a sorted list of integers) is now replaced with a new list of integers.

Here are the changes:
- `arr2` is updated to a new list of integers obtained from the input.
- The other variables (`arr1`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr1` is a list of integers obtained from input, `arr2` is a new list of integers obtained from input, `s1` is `input_n - 1`, `s2` is `input_m - 1`, `e1` is `0`, `e2` is `0`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[input_m-1]|, |arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is `2`**
