`s1` is incremented by 1. The value of `s1` was initially 0, so now it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])**
