Given the initial state and the code snippet:

Initial State:
- `s1` is 1
- `e1` is \( n - 2 \)
- `s2` is 1
- `e2` is \( m - 2 \)
- `sum1` is \(\text{abs}(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + \text{abs}(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])\)
- `sum2` is \(\text{abs}(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + \text{abs}(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])\)
- `d` is \(\max(\text{sum1}, \text{sum2})\)
- `i` is 2

Code Snippet:
```python
sum2 = abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The code updates the value of `sum2` to \(\text{abs}(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + \text{abs}(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])\).
2. Substituting the values from the initial state:
   - `s1` is 1
   - `e1` is \( n - 2 \)
   - `s2` is 1
   - `e2` is \( m - 2 \)

Thus, the updated value of `sum2` is:
\[ \text{sum2} = \text{abs}(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + \text{abs}(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1]) \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[m - 2])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `s1` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `s2` is 1, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 2**
