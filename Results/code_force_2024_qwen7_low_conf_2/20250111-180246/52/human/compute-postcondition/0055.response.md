Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined with `arr1` and `arr2` as sorted lists of integers, `s1` and `s2` both initially set to 1, `e1` set to `n - 2`, `e2` set to `m - 2`, `d` set to `d + sum2`, `i` set to 1, and `sum2` set to `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]`.

2. The code snippet sets `sum1` to `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])`.

   - `s1` and `s2` are both 1, so `arr1[s1]` is `arr1[1]` and `arr2[s2]` is `arr2[1]`.
   - `e1` is `n - 2` and `e2` is `m - 2`.

Thus, `sum1` is calculated as:
\[ \text{sum1} = \text{abs}(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + \text{abs}(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2]) \]

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 1, `s2` is 1, `e1` is `n - 2`, `e2` is `m - 2`, `d` is `d + sum2`, `i` is 1, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0]`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2]`**
