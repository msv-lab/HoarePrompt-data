According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `diff` is updated by adding `max(abs(a[0] - b[0]), abs(a[-n] - b[-n]))` to the previous value of `diff`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, and `n` must still be greater than 0. Since `i` is currently 0, it is less than `n` (as long as `n` is positive). Therefore, we only need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `diff` is updated by `diff + max(abs(a[0] - b[0]), abs(a[-n] - b[-n]))`**
