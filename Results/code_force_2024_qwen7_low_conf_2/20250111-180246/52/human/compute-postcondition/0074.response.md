The code snippet prints the value of `d`. Since the print statement does not modify any variable, the only effect is that the value of `d` is outputted. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is 0, `e2` is 0, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[n-1] - arr2[m-1]|, |arr1[n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is 1, and `d` is printed.**
