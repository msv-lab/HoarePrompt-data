To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop and the current values of the relevant variables.

The `while` loop condition is `s1 < e1 and s2 < e2`.

Given the current state:
- `s1` is 2
- `s2` is 2
- `e1` is `n - 3`
- `e2` is `m - 3`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `s1 < e1` and `s2 < e2` must still be true after the next iteration.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition `s1 < e1`:**
   - `s1` is currently 2.
   - `e1` is `n - 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s1` (which is 2) must still be less than `e1` (which is `n - 3`). This means `n - 3` must be greater than 2, i.e., `n` must be greater than 5.

2. **Condition `s2 < e2`:**
   - `s2` is currently 2.
   - `e2` is `m - 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `s2` (which is 2) must still be less than `e2` (which is `m - 3`). This means `m - 3` must be greater than 2, i.e., `m` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, both `n` and `m` must be greater than 5.

No other states need to be adjusted as the problem does not indicate any changes to other variables that would affect the loop's continuation.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:
State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is 2, `s2` is 2, `e1` is `n - 3`, `e2` is `m - 3`, `d` is `d + max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 1, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[m - 2]) + abs(arr1[n - 2] - arr2[1])`, `sum1` is `abs(arr1[1] - arr2[1]) + abs(arr1[n-2] - arr2[m-2])`, and both `n` and `m` must be greater than 5.**
