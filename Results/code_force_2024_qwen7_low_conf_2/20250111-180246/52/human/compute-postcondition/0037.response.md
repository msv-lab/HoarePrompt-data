The code `diff = 0` sets the variable `diff` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order (equal to `b_new.sort(reverse=True)`).**
