The code updates the values of `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, and `e2`. Specifically, it sets `s1` to `0`, `s2` to `0`, `e1` to `n - 1`, and `e2` to `m - 1`. The other variables (`arr1`, `arr2`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`, and `i`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted new list of integers obtained from input, `s1` is 0, `s2` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[input_m-1]|, |arr1[input_n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is 2**
