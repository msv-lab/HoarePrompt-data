`d` is incremented by the maximum of `sum1` and `sum2`. The values of `sum1` and `sum2` are defined in the initial state, and `d` is initially 0.

Given:
- `sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`
- `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`
- `d` is initially 0

After executing `d += max(sum1, sum2)`, `d` will take the value of the maximum between `sum1` and `sum2`.

Output State: **`sum1` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[0]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[m - 1])`, `sum2` is `abs(arr1[0] - arr2[m - 1]) + abs(arr1[n - 1] - arr2[0])`, `s1` is 0, `e1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is 0, `e2` is `m - 1`, `d` is `max(sum1, sum2)`, `i` is 2**
