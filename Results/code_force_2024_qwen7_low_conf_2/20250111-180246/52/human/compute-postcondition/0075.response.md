Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop is controlled by the variable `i` and it runs for each case specified by the variable `cases`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr1` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `arr2` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `s1` is `n - 1`.
   - `s2` is `m - 1`.
   - `e1` is `0`.
   - `e2` is `0`.
   - `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[n-1] - arr2[m-1]|, |arr1[n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `d` is printed.

3. **Loop iteration details**:
   - The loop runs for `cases` iterations.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `i` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The number of cases `cases` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `2`.
- All other variables (`arr1`, `arr2`, `s1`, `s2`, `e1`, `e2`, `d`) remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr1` is a sorted list of integers, `arr2` is a sorted list of integers, `s1` is `n - 1`, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e1` is `0`, `e2` is `0`, `d` is `d + \max(|arr1[n-1] - arr2[m-1]|, |arr1[n-1] - arr2[0]|)\`, `i` is `2`**.
