The initial state is `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, and `diff` is updated by `diff + max(abs(a[2] - b[2]), abs(a[3 - n] - b[3 - n]))`.

The code snippet updates `diff` by adding `max(abs(a[i] - b[i]), abs(a[i - n] - b[i - n]))`. Here, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3.

1. Calculate `a[i]` and `b[i]`: Since `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `b[i]` is `b[3]`.
2. Calculate `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]`: Since `n` is greater than 3 and `i` is 3, `i - n` is less than 0, which is invalid in this context. Therefore, `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]` are not valid, and we consider only `a[3]` and `b[3]`.
3. Compute `max(abs(a[3] - b[3]), abs(a[3 - n] - b[3 - n]))`: Since `a[i - n]` and `b[i - n]` are not valid, we only compute `max(abs(a[3] - b[3]))`.

After computing the maximum, we add this value to `diff`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is updated by `diff + max(abs(a[3] - b[3]))`**
