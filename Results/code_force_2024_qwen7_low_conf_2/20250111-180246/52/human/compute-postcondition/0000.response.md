`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `t` is read from the input and converted to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged as they are not referenced in the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; we read an integer input for `t`.**
