The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. The previous values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. However, the new list of integers is assigned to `a`.

Since the exact input is not specified, we can represent the state in a general form.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100 and t > 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
