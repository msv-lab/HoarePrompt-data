Postcondition: **`s1` is `n - 1`, `e1` is 0, `s2` is `m - 1`, `e2` is 0, `d` is the sum of all values calculated as `max(sum1, sum2)` in each iteration, where `sum1` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[s2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[e2])` and `sum2` is `abs(arr1[s1] - arr2[e2]) + abs(arr1[e1] - arr2[s2])`, `i` is 2, and `s1` is equal to `e1`**
