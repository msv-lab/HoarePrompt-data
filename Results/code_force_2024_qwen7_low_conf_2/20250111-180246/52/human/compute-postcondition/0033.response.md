The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them to a list of integers. This affects the variable `a`, but the values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `diff`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` has been printed, `t` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` has been printed, `t` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**
