The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x` and `mod`. `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < 10^9 + 7\) and \(10^9 + 7 \nmid x\), and `mod` is specifically set to \(10^9 + 7\). The function computes and returns the modular multiplicative inverse of `x` under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using the formula \(x^{mod - 2} \mod mod\). 

The function ensures that `x` is within the valid range and not divisible by `mod`. If these conditions are met, it calculates the modular multiplicative inverse as required. However, if `x` is not within the valid range or if \(10^9 + 7 \mid x\), the function will still execute and return the result, but the input should not have these issues as per the specified constraints.
