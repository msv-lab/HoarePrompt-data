You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Rammstein - Ausländer](https://youtu.be/3eEA6H_y1VI)

ඞ

There are m baskets placed along a circle, numbered from 1 to m in clockwise
order (basket m is next to basket 1 ). Furthermore, there are n balls, where
ball i is initially placed in basket a_i , and no basket contains more than
one ball.

Alice is allowed to perform the following operation, which always takes
exactly one second whether you move/throw a ball or not:

  * Alice chooses an integer i between 1 and n uniformly at random. 
  * If ball i was thrown away before, do nothing. 
  * Otherwise, ball i is moved from the basket currently containing it to the next basket (in clockwise order). If the target basket currently contains another ball j , throw ball j away. 

She repeats this operation until there is exactly one ball left. Calculate the
expected time needed (in seconds) for Alice to end the process.

It can be proven that the answer can be represented as a rational number
\frac{p}{q} with coprime p and q . You need to output p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod
10^9 + 7 . It can be proven that 10^9 + 7 \nmid q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5, n \le m \le 10^9 ) — the number of balls and the number of
baskets.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le m , a_i 's are pairwise distinct) — the initial position of each
ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the expected amount of time (in
seconds) Alice needs to end the process, modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, Alice could have proceeded as follows (we define a_i =
-1 if ball i has been thrown out):

  * Initially, a = [5, 1, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 2 . After this, a = [5, 2, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 3 . After this, a = [5, 3, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 4 . As basket 4 previously contains ball 3 , this ball is thrown out. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 3 with probability \frac{1}{3} . Ball 3 has already been thrown out, so nothing happens. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 5 , which throws out ball 1 . After this, a = [-1, 5, -1] , and the process ends. 

The answer for this test case is \frac{189}{5} .

The answer for the second test case is 14 (note that these two balls are next
to each other).

The answer for the third test case is 35 .

The answer for the fourth test case is \frac{220}{3} .

In the fifth test case, as there is only one ball initially, the answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of test cases \(t\), the size of a list \(n\), the upper limit \(m\), and a list of integers \(a\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the sorted list \(a\), the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and predefined constants such as \(inv_2\) and \(inv_3\). The final output for each test case is the result of a complex computation involving distances between elements in the list \(a\), probabilities, and expected times, all taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function ensures that \(t\) is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). If \(t\) is outside this range, it does not process any test cases and behaves as though no test cases were provided. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the result for each test case directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided solution, let's break down the logic step by step and compare it to the problem statement.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - We have `n` balls and `m` baskets arranged in a circle.
   - Balls are initially placed in distinct baskets.
   - Each operation involves selecting a ball uniformly at random and moving it to the next basket. If the target basket is occupied, the existing ball is thrown away.
   - We need to compute the expected time until exactly one ball remains, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - The key insight is that the expected time to reduce the number of balls by one can be derived using probabilistic methods and the properties of the circle arrangement.
   - For each ball, the expected time to move to the next basket and potentially throw out another ball is related to the distance between the current and target baskets.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code initializes constants for modular arithmetic (`MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`).
   - It reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of the balls (`a`).
   - It sorts the initial positions for easier computation.
   - It calculates the inverse of `m` (to handle division in modular arithmetic).
   - It iterates through each ball, calculating the distance to the next ball and using this to compute the expected time for the current ball to either move or be thrown out.
   - The formula used seems to derive the expected time based on the distance and the total number of balls.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly computes the expected time for each ball to either move or be thrown out, considering the circular arrangement and the probabilities involved.
   - The final result is computed correctly by summing up the contributions from each ball and applying the necessary modular arithmetic operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.
