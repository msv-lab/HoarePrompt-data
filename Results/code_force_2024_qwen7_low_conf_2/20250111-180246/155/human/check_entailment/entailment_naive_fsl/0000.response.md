Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the expected time using a formula that does not accurately reflect the process described.

The program attempts to calculate the expected time using a combination of distances, probabilities, and modular inverses. However, the approach taken does not correctly model the operations and their probabilities as described. For instance, the formula used to compute `expected_time` and the way distances and probabilities are combined do not accurately simulate the random selection of balls and the movement logic specified in the problem.

A correct implementation would need to properly handle the random selection of balls, the movement of balls to the next basket, and the throwing away of balls that collide with others. The current implementation seems to oversimplify the problem and does not account for the detailed process of the operations as described. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for at least one potential case, leading to an incorrect result.
