Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that the logic and calculations within the program align with the problem statement and the mathematical solution described.

### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the number of balls \(n\), the number of baskets \(m\), and the initial positions of the balls.
2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program sorts the list of initial ball positions.
   - It calculates the distance between consecutive balls in a circular manner.
   - It uses predefined constants `inv_2` and `inv_3` which represent modular inverses of 2 and 3 respectively.
   - The formula for expected time involves the distance between balls, the probability of selecting a ball, and the expected number of moves.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where there is only one ball initially.

### Analysis:
- **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the inputs as described in the problem statement.
- **Distance Calculation**: The distance calculation between consecutive balls in a circular manner is correct.
- **Modular Inverses**: The use of modular inverses (`inv_2` and `inv_3`) is appropriate for division operations under modulo arithmetic.
- **Expected Time Calculation**: The formula used in the program seems to follow the mathematical derivation for the expected time based on the problem's constraints.
- **Modulo Operation**: The final result is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the case where there is only one ball initially.

Given that the provided program correctly implements the logic and handles all necessary calculations as described in the problem statement, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
