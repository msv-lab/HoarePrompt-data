### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its logic against the problem statement and the annotations.

#### Problem Recap:
- We have \( n \) balls and \( m \) baskets arranged in a circle.
- Balls are initially placed in distinct baskets.
- Each operation involves selecting a ball uniformly at random and moving it to the next basket. If the target basket is occupied, the existing ball is thrown away.
- We need to compute the expected time until exactly one ball remains, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Key Concepts:
- The key insight is that the expected time to reduce the number of balls by one can be derived using probabilistic methods and the properties of the circle arrangement.
- For each ball, the expected time to move to the next basket and potentially throw out another ball is related to the distance between the current and target baskets.

#### Algorithm Analysis:
- The provided code:
  - Initializes constants for modular arithmetic (`MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`).
  - Reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of the balls (`a`).
  - Sorts the initial positions for easier computation.
  - Calculates the inverse of `m` (to handle division in modular arithmetic).
  - Iterates through each ball, calculating the distance to the next ball and using this to compute the expected time for the current ball to either move or be thrown out.
  - The formula used seems to derive the expected time based on the distance and the total number of balls.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Constants `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3` are correctly initialized.
   - The input `tc` is read, indicating the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read, followed by the initial positions of the balls in `a`.
   - The list `a` is sorted for easier computation of distances.

3. **Inverse Modulo Calculation**:
   - `inv_m` is calculated as \( m^{(MOD - 2)} \mod MOD \), which is used for division in modular arithmetic.

4. **Main Logic Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each ball index `i`:
     - `dist` is calculated as the distance to the next ball in the sorted list.
     - `prob_last` is calculated as \( \text{dist} \times inv_m \mod MOD \), representing the probability that the current ball will be the last one to move.
     - `expected_getting_moved` is set to \( n \times inv_2 \mod MOD \), which simplifies the expected number of moves for a ball to be thrown out.
     - `expected_time` is calculated as \( (m^2 - \text{dist}^2) \times inv_3 \mod MOD \), representing the expected time for a ball to be thrown out based on the distance.
     - `ans` is updated by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` modulo `MOD`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, representing the expected time for the given test case.

#### Verification:
- The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected time for each ball to be thrown out, considering the circular arrangement and the probabilities involved.
- The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the results remain within the required bounds.

Given the above analysis, the provided code indeed follows the correct approach to solve the problem. The logic and calculations appear to be accurate.
