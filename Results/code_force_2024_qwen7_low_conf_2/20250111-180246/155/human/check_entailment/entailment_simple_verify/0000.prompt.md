You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Rammstein - Ausländer](https://youtu.be/3eEA6H_y1VI)

ඞ

There are m baskets placed along a circle, numbered from 1 to m in clockwise
order (basket m is next to basket 1 ). Furthermore, there are n balls, where
ball i is initially placed in basket a_i , and no basket contains more than
one ball.

Alice is allowed to perform the following operation, which always takes
exactly one second whether you move/throw a ball or not:

  * Alice chooses an integer i between 1 and n uniformly at random. 
  * If ball i was thrown away before, do nothing. 
  * Otherwise, ball i is moved from the basket currently containing it to the next basket (in clockwise order). If the target basket currently contains another ball j , throw ball j away. 

She repeats this operation until there is exactly one ball left. Calculate the
expected time needed (in seconds) for Alice to end the process.

It can be proven that the answer can be represented as a rational number
\frac{p}{q} with coprime p and q . You need to output p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod
10^9 + 7 . It can be proven that 10^9 + 7 \nmid q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5, n \le m \le 10^9 ) — the number of balls and the number of
baskets.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le m , a_i 's are pairwise distinct) — the initial position of each
ball.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the expected amount of time (in
seconds) Alice needs to end the process, modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, Alice could have proceeded as follows (we define a_i =
-1 if ball i has been thrown out):

  * Initially, a = [5, 1, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 2 . After this, a = [5, 2, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 3 . After this, a = [5, 3, 4] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 4 . As basket 4 previously contains ball 3 , this ball is thrown out. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 3 with probability \frac{1}{3} . Ball 3 has already been thrown out, so nothing happens. After this, a = [5, 4, -1] . 
  * Alice chooses i = 2 with probability \frac{1}{3} , and ball 2 is moved to basket 5 , which throws out ball 1 . After this, a = [-1, 5, -1] , and the process ends. 

The answer for this test case is \frac{189}{5} .

The answer for the second test case is 14 (note that these two balls are next
to each other).

The answer for the third test case is 35 .

The answer for the fourth test case is \frac{220}{3} .

In the fifth test case, as there is only one ball initially, the answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program calculates the expected time using a formula that does not accurately reflect the process described.

The program attempts to calculate the expected time using a combination of distances, probabilities, and modular inverses. However, the approach taken does not correctly model the operations and their probabilities as described. For instance, the formula used to compute `expected_time` and the way distances and probabilities are combined do not accurately simulate the random selection of balls and the movement logic specified in the problem.

A correct implementation would need to properly handle the random selection of balls, the movement of balls to the next basket, and the throwing away of balls that collide with others. The current implementation seems to oversimplify the problem and does not account for the detailed process of the operations as described. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for at least one potential case, leading to an incorrect result.
