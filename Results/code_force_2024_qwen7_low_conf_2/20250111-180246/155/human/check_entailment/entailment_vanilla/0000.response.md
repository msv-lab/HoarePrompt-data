Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided solution, let's break down the logic step by step and compare it to the problem statement.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - We have `n` balls and `m` baskets arranged in a circle.
   - Balls are initially placed in distinct baskets.
   - Each operation involves selecting a ball uniformly at random and moving it to the next basket. If the target basket is occupied, the existing ball is thrown away.
   - We need to compute the expected time until exactly one ball remains, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - The key insight is that the expected time to reduce the number of balls by one can be derived using probabilistic methods and the properties of the circle arrangement.
   - For each ball, the expected time to move to the next basket and potentially throw out another ball is related to the distance between the current and target baskets.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code initializes constants for modular arithmetic (`MOD`, `inv_2`, `inv_3`).
   - It reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of the balls (`a`).
   - It sorts the initial positions for easier computation.
   - It calculates the inverse of `m` (to handle division in modular arithmetic).
   - It iterates through each ball, calculating the distance to the next ball and using this to compute the expected time for the current ball to either move or be thrown out.
   - The formula used seems to derive the expected time based on the distance and the total number of balls.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly computes the expected time for each ball to either move or be thrown out, considering the circular arrangement and the probabilities involved.
   - The final result is computed correctly by summing up the contributions from each ball and applying the necessary modular arithmetic operations.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
