Reasoning:  
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key points that confirm its correctness:

1. **Initialization and Constants**: The program initializes constants like `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3` correctly using modular arithmetic. This ensures that the calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case appropriately. It handles the constraints and inputs as specified, including ensuring that `n` and `m` are within their respective ranges.

3. **List Processing**: The program sorts the list `a` and then iterates through the list to calculate the required values. It correctly computes the distance between consecutive elements in the sorted list and uses this to compute the probability and expected time as described in the problem statement.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary due to the large input sizes.

5. **Output**: The program prints the computed result for each test case, which is the expected time in seconds, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given that the program follows the problem specification accurately and performs all necessary computations correctly, it is a correct implementation.

Correctness: **True**
