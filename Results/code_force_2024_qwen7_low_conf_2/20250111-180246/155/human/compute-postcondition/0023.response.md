Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1
- `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\)
- `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m \% MOD)\)
- `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\)
- `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\)
- `ans` is the remainder of its original value plus `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` when divided by `MOD`

### For Loop
The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

### Analysis for the Next Iteration
- The variable `i` will increment by 1 in each iteration. So, if it was `i` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- Since the loop is based on the range `range(n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i + 1` should still be less than `n`.

### Adjusted States
1. **`i`**: It will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. **`n`**: No change needed for `n` since it does not change within the loop.
3. **`dist`**: This value depends on `a[(i + 1) \% n]` and `a[i]`. With `i` becoming `i + 1`, the new `dist` will be \((a[(i + 2) \% n] - a[i + 1]) \% m\).
4. **`prob_last`**: This value depends on the updated `dist`. So, it will be recalculated using the new `dist`.
5. **`expected_getting_moved`**: This value remains the same since it is based on `n`, which does not change.
6. **`expected_time`**: This value remains the same since it is based on `m`, which does not change.
7. **`ans`**: This value will be updated based on the new `prob_last` and other values.

### Final State for the Next Iteration
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `dist` will be \((a[(i + 2) \% n] - a[i + 1]) \% m\).
- `prob_last` will be recalculated using the new `dist`.
- `expected_getting_moved` will remain the same.
- `expected_time` will remain the same.
- `ans` will be updated.

### Answer
State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dist` is \((a[(i + 2) \% n] - a[i + 1]) \% m\), `prob_last` is recalculated, `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the updated value**.
