`prob_last` is assigned the value of `dist * inv_m % MOD`. Given that `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, the value of `prob_last` will be `(a[1] - a[0]) % m` multiplied by `inv_m` (which is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`) and then taken modulo `MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD**
