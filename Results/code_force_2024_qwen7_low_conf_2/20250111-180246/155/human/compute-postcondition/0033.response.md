The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. However, since no specific values are provided in the input, these variables are left as the result of the input operation. The `ans` and `tc` variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`, and `tc` is `tc + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer.**
