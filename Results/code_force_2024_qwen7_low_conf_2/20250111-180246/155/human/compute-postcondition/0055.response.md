The code updates the value of `expected_time` using the formula `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` is greater than 4.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is 5.
- `dist` is `(a[(5 % n)] - a[4]) % m`.
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`.

After executing the code, `expected_time` is calculated as `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is greater than 4, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 5, `dist` is `(a[(5 % n)] - a[4]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD**
