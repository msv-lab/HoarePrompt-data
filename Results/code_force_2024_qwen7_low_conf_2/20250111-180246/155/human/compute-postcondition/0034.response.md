The code `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes an input of space-separated integers, converts them to a list of integers, sorts the list, and assigns it to `a`. The original values of `ans`, `tc`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`, and `tc` is `tc + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**
