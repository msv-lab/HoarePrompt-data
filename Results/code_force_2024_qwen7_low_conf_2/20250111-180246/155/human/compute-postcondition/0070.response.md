`ans` is incremented by the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all taken modulo `MOD`. 

- `prob_last` is equal to `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is equal to `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is equal to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\).

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is:
\[ ans += (dist * inv_m % MOD) * (n * inv_2 % MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD) % MOD \]

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\); `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\); `ans` is updated by the formula above**
