The code updates the value of `prob_last` to `dist * inv_m % MOD`. This means that `prob_last` is now calculated as the product of `dist` and `inv_m` modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dist`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the updated value**
