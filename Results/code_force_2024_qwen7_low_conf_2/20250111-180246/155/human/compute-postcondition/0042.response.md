`ans` is incremented by `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans` is the sum of its previous value (which is 0) and the new term calculated. Therefore, `ans` becomes `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
