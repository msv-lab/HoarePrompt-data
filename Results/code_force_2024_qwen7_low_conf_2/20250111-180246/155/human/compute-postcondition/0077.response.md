`ans` is incremented by the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, all taken modulo `MOD`. The value of `prob_last` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, the value of `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, and the value of `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_old + 1`; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\); `prob_last` is \(((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m * inv_m) % MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is \(((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) % MOD\); `ans` is updated to `ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time) % MOD**
