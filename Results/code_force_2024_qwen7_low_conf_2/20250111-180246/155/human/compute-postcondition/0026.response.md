The code updates the value of `expected_getting_moved` to `n * inv_2 % MOD`. This value was previously set in the initial state, and now it remains unchanged except for the new assignment. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is the updated value**
