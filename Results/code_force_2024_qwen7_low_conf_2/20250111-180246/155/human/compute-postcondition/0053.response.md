The code snippet `prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD` updates the value of `prob_last`. Given the initial state, `dist` is defined as `(a[(5 % n)] - a[4]) % m`, and `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`. The operation `prob_last = dist * inv_m % MOD` calculates the new value of `prob_last` using these definitions.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, the updated state is as follows:

- `prob_last` is updated to `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- All other variables remain in their initial or calculated state from the initial conditions.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 5, `dist` is `(a[(5 % n)] - a[4]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`**
