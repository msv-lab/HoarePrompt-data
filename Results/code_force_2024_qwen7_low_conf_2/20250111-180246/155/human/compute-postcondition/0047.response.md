The code changes the value of `expected_getting_moved` to `n * inv_2 % MOD`. The previous value of `expected_getting_moved` was `n * inv_m % MOD`. The value of `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, so the new value of `expected_getting_moved` is `n * (m ** (MOD - 2)) % MOD`. 

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[3 % n] - a[2]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * (m ** (MOD - 2)) % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD**
