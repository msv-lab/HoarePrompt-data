The code calculates `expected_time` using the formula `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. Here, `inv_3` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a constant or a previously defined variable.

Let's break down the calculation:

- `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`
- `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`
- `inv_3` is a constant or previously defined variable

The calculation for `expected_time` is:

```python
expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD
```

Since `inv_3` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value, but we know that `expected_time` will be calculated based on the given formula. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
