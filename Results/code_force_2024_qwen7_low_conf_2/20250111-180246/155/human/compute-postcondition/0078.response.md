The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_old + 1`; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\); `prob_last` is \(((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m * inv_m) % MOD\); `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is \(((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) % MOD\); `ans` is updated to \(`ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time) % MOD`\) and then taken modulo `MOD`.**
