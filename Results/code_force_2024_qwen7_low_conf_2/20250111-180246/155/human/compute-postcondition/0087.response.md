The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of the variable `ans`. There is no change in the value of any variable or addition of new variables. The output of this line will depend on the current value of `ans`. However, since the initial state does not specify what `ans` is, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is in its original state**
