The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` but does not change the value of `ans` itself. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, `ans` is 0.**
