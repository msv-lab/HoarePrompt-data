Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes various variables such as `ans`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `inv_m`, `i`, `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved`.

2. The code updates `expected_getting_moved` using the formula:
   ```python
   expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD
   ```

3. From the initial state, we know:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.
   - `dist` is `(a[3 % n] - a[2]) % m`.
   - `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.

4. Substituting `i` with 3 in `inv_3`, the new value for `expected_time` becomes:
   ```python
   expected_time = (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD
   ```

5. Since `inv_m` is already calculated, we don't need to recalculate it here.

6. The variables `ans`, `tc`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `inv_m`, `i`, `dist`, and `prob_last` remain unchanged because they are not directly used in the calculation of `expected_time`. The only updated variable is `expected_getting_moved` which is now set to `expected_time`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `ans` is `ans % MOD`.
- `tc` is `tc + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.
- `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is 3.
- `dist` is `(a[3 % n] - a[2]) % m`.
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[3 % n] - a[2]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD**.
