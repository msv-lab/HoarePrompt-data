The code updates the value of `expected_time` to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\). The other variables remain unchanged.

- `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
- `dist` remains \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\).
- `prob_last` remains \((dist * inv_m \% MOD)\).
- `expected_getting_moved` remains \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\).
- `ans` remains the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m \% MOD)\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `ans` is the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`.**
