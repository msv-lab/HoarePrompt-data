To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the for loop and their initial conditions.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(tc):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each iteration of `tc`.
   - `tc` is given as an input integer, and it must be a positive integer (since `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` implies `1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4`).

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `t`: This variable is mentioned but not directly used in the loop. Its range (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) does not affect the loop condition.
   - `n` and `m`: These are used to define the length of the list `a` and the range of its elements. However, they do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute.
   - `a`: This is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between `1` and `m` and all `a_i's` are distinct. This list's definition does not impact the loop's execution.
   - `MOD`, `inv_2`, and `inv_3`: These are constants and do not affect the loop's execution.
   - `tc`: This is the only variable that determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Since `tc` must be a positive integer, it needs to be checked if `tc > 0`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `tc` must be greater than 0. All other variables are not directly relevant to the loop's execution based on the given information.

### Final State:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
