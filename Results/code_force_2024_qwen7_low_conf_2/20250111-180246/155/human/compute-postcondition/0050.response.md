The code snippet `ans %= MOD` modifies the variable `ans` by taking its value modulo `MOD`. This operation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved) % MOD`
- `tc` is `tc + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input
- `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`
- `i` is 3
- `dist` is `(a[3 % n] - a[2]) % m`
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`

After executing `ans %= MOD`, the updated state is:
- `ans` is now `ans % MOD`
- All other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `inv_m`, `i`, `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 3, `dist` is `(a[3 % n] - a[2]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD**
