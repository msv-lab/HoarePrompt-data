`tc` is assigned the value greater than 0, `n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from the input split and converted to integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tc` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer.

Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**
