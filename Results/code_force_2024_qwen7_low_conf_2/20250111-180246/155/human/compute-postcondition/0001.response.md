The code initializes `inv_2` to \((\text{MOD} + 1) // 2\). Given that \(\text{MOD}\) is \(1000000007\), we can calculate:

\[
\text{inv\_2} = (1000000007 + 1) // 2 = 1000000008 // 2 = 500000004
\]

The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `MOD` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is 1000000007; `inv_2` is 500000004**
