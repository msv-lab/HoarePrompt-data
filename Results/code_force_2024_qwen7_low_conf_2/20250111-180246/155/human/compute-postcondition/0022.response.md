The code `ans %= MOD` takes the current value of `ans` and updates it to be the remainder when divided by `MOD`. Since the initial state includes `ans` being the remainder of its original value plus `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` when divided by `MOD`, applying the modulo operation again does not change the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m \% MOD)\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `ans` is the remainder of its original value plus `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` when divided by `MOD`.**
