The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, each taken modulo `MOD`. Let's break down the values involved:

- `prob_last` is defined as `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is defined as `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is defined as `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is calculated as follows:
\[ ans \text{ (new)} = ans + (prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time) \% MOD \]
Substituting the expressions for `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, we get:
\[ ans \text{ (new)} = ans + ((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD \]

Since the other variables (`i`, `n`, `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`) are not affected by this operation, they retain their original values.

Output State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is updated to `ans + ((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD**
