Output State: **`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 5, `dist` is `(a[(5 % n)] - a[4]) % m`, `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is updated to `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_m % MOD`**
