The code updates the variable `expected_time` with the value of \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\). Here, `dist` and other variables remain unchanged.

- `dist` remains as \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\).
- `prob_last` remains as `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` remains as `n * inv_2 % MOD`.

The calculation for `expected_time` does not affect these other variables. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `expected_time`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\); `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\)**
