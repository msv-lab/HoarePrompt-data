Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of test cases \(t\), the size of a list \(n\), the upper limit \(m\), and a list of integers \(a\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the sorted list \(a\), the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and predefined constants such as \(inv_2\) and \(inv_3\). The final output for each test case is the result of a complex computation involving distances between elements in the list \(a\), probabilities, and expected times, all taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function ensures that \(t\) is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). If \(t\) is outside this range, it does not process any test cases and behaves as though no test cases were provided. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the result for each test case directly.**

Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- The function correctly checks if \(t\) is within the specified range. If \(t\) is out of bounds, it does not proceed with processing any test cases.
- The function assumes that for each test case, \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n \leq m \leq 10^9\). It does not validate these conditions.
- The function processes each element in the list \(a\) assuming that all \(a_i\) are pairwise distinct and within the valid range \(1 \leq a_i \leq m\). It does not check for the distinctness of the elements or their validity within the specified range.
