The code snippet updates the value of `expected_getting_moved` to `n * inv_2 % MOD`. Here, `inv_2` is not defined in the given initial state, so we assume it is a typo or placeholder for another variable, likely intended to be `inv_m`. Given this, `expected_getting_moved` is calculated as `n * inv_m % MOD`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged: `ans` is 0, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, and `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`ans` is 0, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_m % MOD**.
