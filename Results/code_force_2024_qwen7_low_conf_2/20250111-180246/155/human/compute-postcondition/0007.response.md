The code `inv_m = pow(m, MOD - 2, MOD)` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` with respect to `MOD` and assigns it to `inv_m`. The values of `tc`, `n`, `m`, and `a` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user; `inv_m` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `m` with respect to `MOD`.**
