The code updates the variable `expected_getting_moved` by assigning it the value of `n * inv_2 % MOD`. This calculation does not affect the values of `n`, `dist`, or `prob_last`. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is the result of ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m); `prob_last` is calculated as dist * inv_m % MOD; `expected_getting_moved` is n * inv_2 % MOD.**
