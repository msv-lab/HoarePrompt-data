The code initializes `ans` to 0, which sets `ans` to 0 while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is 0, `tc` is `tc + 1`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input; `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.**
