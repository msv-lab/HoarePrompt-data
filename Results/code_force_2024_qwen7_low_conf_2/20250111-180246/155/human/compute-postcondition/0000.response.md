The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This value is assigned to `MOD`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the assignment of the `MOD` constant.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and n ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ m and all a_i's are pairwise distinct; MOD is 1000000007**
