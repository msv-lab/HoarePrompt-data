`ans` is assigned the value of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` and added to its current value. The variables `dist`, `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time` remain unchanged. The Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is the result of ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m); `prob_last` is calculated as dist * inv_m % MOD; `expected_getting_moved` is n * inv_2 % MOD; `expected_time` is (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD; `ans` is updated by adding prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD to its current value.
