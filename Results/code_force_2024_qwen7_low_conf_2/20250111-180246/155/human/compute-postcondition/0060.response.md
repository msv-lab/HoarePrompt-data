According to the code, the loop iterates `tc` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is printed, `tc` is incremented by `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, and `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the following:

1. `tc` should be incremented by `n`.
2. The loop will execute one more time, so `tc` will be `tc + n`.

Given that `tc` is incremented by `n` at the end of each iteration, the new value of `tc` will be the old value of `tc` plus `n`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `tc` will be `tc + n`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `m` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `inv_m` remains the same.

State: **`ans` is not printed yet, `tc` is `tc + n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`**
