The code does not change the value of `expected_time`, but it reassigns `expected_time` using the formula `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. Since the initial value of `expected_time` was \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\), the new value of `expected_time` remains the same. All other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is `i_old + 1`; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\); `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\); `ans` is updated to `ans % MOD**
