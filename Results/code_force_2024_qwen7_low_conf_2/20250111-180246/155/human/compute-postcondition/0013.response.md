The code updates the value of `expected_time` to `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`. The values of `n`, `dist`, `prob_last`, and `expected_getting_moved` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `expected_time`.

Let's calculate the new value of `expected_time`:

- `m` is unchanged.
- `dist` is unchanged.
- `inv_3` is unchanged.
- `MOD` is unchanged.

So, `expected_time` is updated to \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\).

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is the result of ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m); `prob_last` is calculated as dist * inv_m % MOD; `expected_getting_moved` is n * inv_2 % MOD; `expected_time` is (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD.**
