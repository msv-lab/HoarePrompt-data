The code snippet `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` by taking it modulo `MOD`. This operation does not affect any other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD`
- `tc` is `tc + 1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input
- `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`
- `i` is 1
- `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`
- `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_m % MOD`
- `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`

After executing `ans %= MOD`, the value of `ans` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`ans` is `ans % MOD`, `tc` is `tc + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1, `dist` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m`, `prob_last` is `(a[1] - a[0]) % m * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`**
