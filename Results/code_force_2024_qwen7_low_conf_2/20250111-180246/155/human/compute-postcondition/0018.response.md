The code snippet assigns the value of `dist * inv_m % MOD` to `prob_last`. This updates the value of `prob_last` but does not affect the values of `n`, `dist`, `inv_m`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m \% MOD)\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `ans` is the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`.**
