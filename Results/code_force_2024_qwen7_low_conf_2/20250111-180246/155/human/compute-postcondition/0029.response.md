`ans` is updated to `ans + ((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD`. The value of `ans` is now increased by the calculated expression, and the new value of `ans` is taken modulo `MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is \(i + 1\), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\), `ans` is updated to `ans + ((dist * inv_m \% MOD) * (n * inv_2 \% MOD) * ((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD)) \% MOD and ans is taken modulo MOD**
