`prob_last` is assigned the value of `dist * inv_m % MOD`. The value of `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`, and the values of `inv_m` and `MOD` are unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `prob_last` is the result of the multiplication and modulo operation with `dist` and `inv_m`, and the modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`; `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`**
