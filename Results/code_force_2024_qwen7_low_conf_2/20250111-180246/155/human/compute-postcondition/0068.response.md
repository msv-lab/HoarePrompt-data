The code assigns the value of `n * inv_2 % MOD` to the variable `expected_getting_moved`. The variables `n`, `dist`, `prob_last`, `inv_2`, and `MOD` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `dist` is `(a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m`; `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`**
