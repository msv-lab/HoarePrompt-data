The code `a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and assigns it to `a`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `m`, and the input is taken from the user, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`. However, we know that `a` is now a sorted list of integers.

The states of the other variables (`tc`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`tc` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user**
