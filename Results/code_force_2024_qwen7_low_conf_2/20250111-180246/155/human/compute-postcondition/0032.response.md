Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`.
   - If `n` is 0, `ans` is 0.

2. **Understand the Loop**: The loop is defined as:
   ```
   for _ in range(tc):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine Variables Affected by the Loop**: The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not directly affect `ans` or `n`. However, the loop itself needs to be executed `tc` times to complete.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not change any variables, the value of `ans` and `n` remain unchanged within the loop.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we simply need to increment the loop counter `tc` by 1.

5. **Final State**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop is ready to execute once more.

State: **`ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`, and `tc` is incremented by 1**.

So, the final state can be expressed as:
State: **`ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`, and `tc` is tc + 1**.
