The code updates the value of `prob_last` to be `dist * inv_m % MOD`. This means the value of `prob_last` is now directly derived from the previous value of `dist` and `inv_m`.

- The initial value of `dist` was \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\).
- The initial value of `prob_last` was \(((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m * inv_m) \% MOD\).

Since `dist` remains the same and only `prob_last` is updated, the new value of `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `inv_m`, `MOD`, `expected_getting_moved`, `expected_time`, and `ans`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_old + 2`, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \(((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) \% MOD\), `ans` is updated accordingly**
