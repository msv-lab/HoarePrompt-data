The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by adding the product of `prob_last`, `expected_getting_moved`, and `expected_time`, each modulo `MOD`. Let's break down the calculation:

- `prob_last` is defined as `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is defined as `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is defined as `((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) % MOD`.

So, the expression `ans += prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` translates to updating `ans` by adding the value of `(prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time) % MOD`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `i_old + 2`.
- `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\).
- `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is \(((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) \% MOD\).

The only change in the output state is the update to `ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_old + 2`, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`, `expected_time` is \(((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) \% MOD\), `ans` is updated accordingly**.
