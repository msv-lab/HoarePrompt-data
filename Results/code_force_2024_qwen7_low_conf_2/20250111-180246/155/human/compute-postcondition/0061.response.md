The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is not printed yet
- `tc` is `tc + n`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input
- `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`

After executing the code:
- `n` and `m` are updated to the input integers.
- The other variables remain in their initial form except for the update of `tc`.

Output State: **`ans` is not printed yet, `tc` is `tc + n`, `n` is an input integer (updated), `m` is an input integer (updated), `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`**
