The code reads an integer value for `tc` using `input()`. This means `tc` will be assigned the value entered as input by the user, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` and `m` are integers such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5` and `n ≤ m ≤ 10^9`, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ m` and all `a_i's` are pairwise distinct; `MOD` is `1000000007`; `inv_2` is `500000004`; `inv_3` is `3^1000000005 % 1000000007`; `tc` is an input integer**
