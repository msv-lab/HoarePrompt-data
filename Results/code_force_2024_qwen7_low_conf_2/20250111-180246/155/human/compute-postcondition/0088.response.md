Output State: **`tc` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `ans` is the accumulated sum of `prob_last * expected_getting_moved * expected_time` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, modulo `MOD`. If `tc` is 0, `ans` is 0. `n` and `m` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.**
