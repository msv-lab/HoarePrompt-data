The code `ans %= MOD` updates the variable `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. This operation does not change the other variables, so they retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m\); `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`; `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`; `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD\); `ans` is updated to `ans % MOD`**
