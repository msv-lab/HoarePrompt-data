The code snippet updates the variable `ans` by taking the modulo of `ans` with `MOD`. This means that `ans` is now the remainder when the current value of `ans` is divided by `MOD`.

- The initial state includes that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `dist` is the result of `((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m)`.
- `prob_last` is calculated as `dist * inv_m % MOD`.
- `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 % MOD`.
- `expected_time` is `(m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD`.
- `ans` is updated by adding `prob_last * expected_getting_moved % MOD * expected_time % MOD` to its current value.

After executing `ans %= MOD`, the value of `ans` is updated to its remainder when divided by `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is the result of ((a[(i + 1) % n] - a[i]) % m); `prob_last` is calculated as dist * inv_m % MOD; `expected_getting_moved` is n * inv_2 % MOD; `expected_time` is (m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 % MOD; `ans` is the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`.**
