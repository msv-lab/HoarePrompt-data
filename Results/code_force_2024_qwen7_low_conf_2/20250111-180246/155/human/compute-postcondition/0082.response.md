The code updates `expected_getting_moved` to `n * inv_2 % MOD`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the value of `expected_getting_moved` is now `n * inv_2 % MOD`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_old + 2`, `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\), `prob_last` is `dist * inv_m % MOD`, `expected_getting_moved` is `n * inv_2 \% MOD`, `expected_time` is \(((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3) \% MOD\), `ans` is updated accordingly**
