The code updates the value of `expected_getting_moved` by calculating \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\). Since the initial value of `expected_getting_moved` is already \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\), this assignment does not change its value.

The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `dist` is \((a[(i + 1) \% n] - a[i]) \% m\); `prob_last` is \((dist * inv_m \% MOD)\); `expected_getting_moved` is \(n * inv_2 \% MOD\); `expected_time` is \((m * m - dist * dist) * inv_3 \% MOD\); `ans` is the remainder of its current value when divided by `MOD`.**
