The code `print(ans)` prints the value of `ans`. Since printing does not affect the value of `ans` or any other variable, the only change is that the value of `ans` is printed. However, none of the other variables (`tc`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `inv_m`) are affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`ans` is printed, `tc` is `tc + n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input, `inv_m` is `m` raised to the power of `MOD - 2` modulo `MOD`.**
