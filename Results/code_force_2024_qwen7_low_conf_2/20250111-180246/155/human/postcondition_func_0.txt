The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of test cases \(t\), the size of a list \(n\), the upper limit \(m\), and a list of integers \(a\). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the sorted list \(a\), the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and predefined constants such as \(inv_2\) and \(inv_3\). The final output for each test case is the result of a complex computation involving distances between elements in the list \(a\), probabilities, and expected times, all taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function ensures that \(t\) is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). If \(t\) is outside this range, it does not process any test cases and behaves as though no test cases were provided. The function does not return a value; instead, it prints the result for each test case directly.
