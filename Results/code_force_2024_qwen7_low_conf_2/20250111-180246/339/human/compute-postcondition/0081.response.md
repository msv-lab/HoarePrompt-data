The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` is 2, so it will become 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 and `current_health[i + 1]` reduced by 6 if `i < n - 1`, or `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 if `i` is not less than `n - 1`, `operations` is 3, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the length of `health`; `current_health[n]` is reduced by 3.**
