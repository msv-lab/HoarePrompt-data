To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for e in range(num - last):` will iterate from `e = 0` to `e < num - last`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `num - last > 0`.

2. **Variables Involved**:
   - `i`: This is part of the set `S` and is used as the index for accessing `bits[i]`.
   - `num`: This corresponds to the value associated with `i` in set `S`.
   - `last`: This is set to `num`.
   - `f`: This is a list containing `g` repeated `num + (num - last)` times.
   - `g`: This is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

Given these points, the initial states need to be adjusted such that the loop condition `num - last > 0` is satisfied. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step analysis:

- **Initial Values**:
  - `i` is the next element in set `S`.
  - `num` is the corresponding value of `num` for the new pair `(i, num)` from set `S`.
  - `last` is equal to `num`.

- **Loop Execution Condition**:
  - For the loop to execute, `num - last` must be greater than 0.
  - Given that `last` is equal to `num`, `num - last` simplifies to `num - num = 0`. Thus, the loop will not execute because the condition `num - last > 0` is never satisfied.

However, since the problem asks us to adjust the states to allow the loop to execute, we need to consider the possibility of `num` being greater than `last` (which would make `num - last > 0` true).

Therefore, the necessary adjustments would be to ensure that `num` is greater than `last`. Since `last` is initialized to `num`, we need to ensure that `num` is greater than `last` after some operations or updates.

### Final State:

To satisfy the loop condition, we need to ensure that `num` is greater than `last` (which is `num`), which implies that `num` must be incremented or modified to a value greater than `last`.

State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times, `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value**.

This ensures that the loop condition `num - last > 0` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute.
