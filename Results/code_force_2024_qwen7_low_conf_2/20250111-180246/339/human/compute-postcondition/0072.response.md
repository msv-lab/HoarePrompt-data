`current_health[i]` is decremented by `k`. Given that `k` is 3, `current_health[i]` will be reduced by 3. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with the `current_health[i]` reduced by 3, `operations` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1), `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of `health`.**
