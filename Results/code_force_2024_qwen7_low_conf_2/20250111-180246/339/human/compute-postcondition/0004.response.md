The code `S = sorted(b, key=lambda x: x[1])` sorts the list `b` based on the second element of each tuple (since `key=lambda x: x[1]` specifies sorting by the second element). Here's the step-by-step impact:

- `b` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an index and a value from list `a`.
- After sorting, `S` will contain the same tuples as `b`, but in ascending order based on the values from `a`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we can't determine the exact content of `S`. However, we know that `S` is a sorted version of `b`.

Output State: **`S` is a sorted version of `b` based on the second element of each tuple, `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index and the corresponding value from list `a`.**
