`current_health[i]` is decremented by `k`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `k` is 2. Therefore, `current_health[4]` is decreased by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is 2, `max_health` remains the same, `health` and `current_health` are updated such that `current_health[4]` is decreased by 2, `results` remains the same, `operations` is 3, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 3.**
