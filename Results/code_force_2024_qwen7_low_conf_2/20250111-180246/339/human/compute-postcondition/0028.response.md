The code appends the value `g` to the list `f`. Initially, `f` contains `g` exactly `num + 1` times and one additional `g`, making it a total of `num + 2` occurrences of `g`. After appending another `g`, the number of occurrences of `g` in `f` becomes `num + 3`.

- The value of `num` remains unchanged.
- The value of `last` remains unchanged.
- The value of `f` changes from containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times and one additional `g` to containing `g` exactly `num + 2` times and two additional `g` (after the append operation).

Output State: **`num` is greater than `last + 1`, `last` is equal to `num - 1`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 2` times**
