Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer representing the number of monsters) and `health` (a list of positive integers where each integer represents the health points of the i-th monster). It returns a list `results` containing `2 * n` elements, each element representing the number of operations performed when `k` (ranging from 1 to the maximum value in the `health` list) is used to reduce the health of each monster by `k` and its adjacent monsters' health by `k` until their health becomes zero or negative. For each value of `k`, the function iterates through the `health` list, performing the specified operations and counting the number of valid indices where the health remains positive. If the health of all monsters becomes zero or negative, the operation count for that `k` is recorded. If the loop does not execute at all (when the initial health values are all zero), the `current_health` list remains unchanged and `operations` is set to 0.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If all monsters have zero health initially, the `current_health` list will remain unchanged, and the `operations` count will be zero for all `k`.
- If the `health` list contains only one element, the function will still iterate from `k=1` to the maximum value in `health`, performing the operations and counting valid indices accordingly.
