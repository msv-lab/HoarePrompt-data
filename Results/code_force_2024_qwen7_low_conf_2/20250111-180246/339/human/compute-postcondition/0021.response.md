The given code snippet is incomplete and does not specify what `bits` and `i` are. However, based on the provided initial state and assuming `bits` is a list and `i` is an integer, let's proceed with the best possible interpretation.

Initial State: `num` is a positive integer, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times.

Given the code snippet:
```python
g += bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1
```

Let's analyze the impact:

- `g` is being modified by adding `bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`.
- The values of `bits`, `i`, and `g` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `g` after this operation.
- `num` and `last` are not affected by this line of code.
- The list `f` is not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times, `g` is `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`.**
