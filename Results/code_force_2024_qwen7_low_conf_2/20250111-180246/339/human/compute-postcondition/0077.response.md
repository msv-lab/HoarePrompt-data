`current_health[i + 1]` is assigned the value of itself minus `k`. Given that `k` is 3, `current_health[i + 1]` is reduced by 3. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` would be `n`, which is out of bounds for the `current_health` list (as lists in Python are 0-indexed). However, for the sake of this calculation, we consider the operation as intended to reduce `current_health[n]` by 3, even though `current_health[n]` does not exist. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with either `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 and `current_health[i + 1]` reduced by 6 if `i < n - 1`, or `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 if `i` is not less than `n - 1`, `operations` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of `health`; `current_health[n]` is reduced by 3.**
