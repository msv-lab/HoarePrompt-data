`N` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `N` will be within the range of 1 to \(10^5\) (inclusive), and this will replace the original value of `n`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the input operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= \(10^5\); `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= \(10^5\) for all i.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= \(10^5\); `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= \(10^5\) for all i.**
