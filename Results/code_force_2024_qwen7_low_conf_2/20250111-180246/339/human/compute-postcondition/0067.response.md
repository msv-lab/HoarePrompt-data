The code `current_health = health[:]` creates a shallow copy of the `health` list and assigns it to `current_health`. This means that `current_health` now contains the same elements as `health`, but they are stored separately. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list, `operations` is the number of valid indices in `current_health` where `current_health[i] > 0`, `i` is the last valid index that was used in the loop, and `n` is the length of `health`.**
