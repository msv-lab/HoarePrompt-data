`f` is appended with the current value of `g`. The value of `g` remains unchanged after this operation. The value of `i`, `num`, `last`, and the structure of `f` are updated accordingly.

- Initially, `f` contains `g` repeated `num + 2` times.
- After appending `g` to `f`, `f` now contains `g` repeated `num + 3` times.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num - 1`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 3` times, `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num - 1`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 3` times, `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value**
