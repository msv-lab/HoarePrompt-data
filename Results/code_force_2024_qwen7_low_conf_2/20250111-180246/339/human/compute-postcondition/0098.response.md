Output State: **`k` is `max_health`, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing `2 * n` elements, each element representing the number of operations performed when `k` equals the corresponding value from 1 to `max_health`, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list where each element `current_health[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) is reduced by a multiple of `k` up to a maximum of `k * (n-1)` (if all elements are greater than 0), `operations` is the number of valid indices in `current_health` where `current_health[i] > 0`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the length of `health`. If the loop does not execute at all, `current_health` remains a shallow copy of `health`, `operations` is 0, and `i` is 1.**
