The code snippet `results.append(operations)` appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of any other variables.

The initial state is:
- `k` is 2
- `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list
- `health` is a list of positive integers
- `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value
- `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list
- `operations` is the number of valid indices in `current_health` where `current_health[i] > 0`
- `i` is the last valid index that was used in the loop
- `n` is the length of `health`

After executing `results.append(operations)`, the `results` list will have one additional element, which is the current value of `operations`.

Output State: **`k` is 2, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list, `operations` is the number of valid indices in `current_health` where `current_health[i] > 0`, `i` is the last valid index that was used in the loop, and `n` is the length of `health`.**
