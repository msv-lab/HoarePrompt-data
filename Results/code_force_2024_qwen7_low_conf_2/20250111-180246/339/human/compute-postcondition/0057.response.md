The value of `operations` is incremented by 1. Initially, `operations` is 2, so after executing the code, `operations` becomes 3. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 2, `max_health` remains the same, `health` and `current_health` remain the same, `results` remains the same, `operations` is 3, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 3.**
