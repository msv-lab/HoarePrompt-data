Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. It first sorts the list based on the values of its elements, then calculates a series of values based on the sorted list and prints the sums of these values for each divisor up to the maximum value in `a`. The final state of the program includes an empty `ans` list, a sorted list `S` based on the second element of each tuple, the maximum value `m` from list `a`, a `bits` list of length `N+2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements each set to `1`, and ending with `0`, a `wtr` list of `N` empty lists, a `f` list containing the elements of `g` repeated for each tuple in `S` based on the second element of the tuple, `g` is `1`, `last` is the last `num` value processed in the loop, and `i` is the last index processed in the loop. Additionally, the function prints the sum of the elements in the list generated by the list comprehension for each divisor from `1` to `m`.**
