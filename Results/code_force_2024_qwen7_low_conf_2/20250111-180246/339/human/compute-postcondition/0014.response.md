According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num` and `last`. The loop will continue as long as `num - last` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
- `num` must be greater than 0
- `last` is 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `num - last` must still be greater than 0. Since `last` is 0, the condition simplifies to checking if `num > 0`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be greater than 0. `last` remains 0.

State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `last` is 0**
