The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` decrements the value of `current_health[i + 1]` by `k`. Given that `k` is 3 and `i` is `n`, the expression `i + 1` would be `n + 1`. Since `n` is the length of the `health` list, `n + 1` would be one index beyond the last element of the `health` list, which means `current_health[n + 1]` does not exist and trying to access it would result in an `IndexError`.

However, assuming the code is intended to be executed within the bounds of the list (i.e., `i < len(current_health)`), the operation would proceed as follows:

- `current_health[i + 1]` is decremented by 3.

Given the initial state:
- `k` is 3
- `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list
- `health` is a list of positive integers
- `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value
- `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[n]` reduced by 3, and if `i > 0`, `current_health[n - 1]` is further reduced by 3
- `operations` is 3
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the length of `health`

After executing `current_health[i + 1] -= k`:
- The value of `current_health[i + 1]` (which is `current_health[n]`) is reduced by 3.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[n]` further reduced by 3, `operations` is 3, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `health`**
