`current_health[i - 1]` is assigned the value of itself minus `k`, where `k` is 3. Given that `current_health[i]` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with each element reduced by 3, the value of `current_health[i - 1]` before this operation would be `health[i - 1] - 3`. After subtracting `k` from `current_health[i - 1]`, the new value of `current_health[i - 1]` will be `health[i - 1] - 6`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with the `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 and `current_health[i - 1]` reduced by 6, `operations` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1), `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of `health`. The current value of `i` is greater than 0.**
