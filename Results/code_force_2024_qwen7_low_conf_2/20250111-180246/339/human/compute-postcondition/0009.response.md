The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `g`. This is the only change made to the variables. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`S` is a sorted version of `b` based on the second element of each tuple, `ans` is an empty list, `b` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index and the corresponding value from list `a`, `m` is the maximum value from list `a`, `bits` is a list of length `N+2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements each set to `1`, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is an empty list, `g` is `1`**
