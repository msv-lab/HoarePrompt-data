The code initializes the variable `operations` to 0. This operation does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `operations`.

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list, `operations` is 0, `i` is the last valid index that was used in the loop, and `n` is the length of `health`.**
