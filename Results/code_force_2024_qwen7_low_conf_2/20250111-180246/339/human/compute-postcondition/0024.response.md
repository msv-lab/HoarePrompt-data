`f.append(g)` appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. From the initial state, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times, and `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`. Since `f` already contains `g` `num` times, appending `g` again means `f` now contains `g` `num + 1` times.

Output State: **`num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`**
