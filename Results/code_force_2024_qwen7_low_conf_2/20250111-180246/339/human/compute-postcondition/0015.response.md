The code `f.append(g)` appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. However, the initial state does not provide any specific value for `g`. Therefore, `g` is simply appended to the list `f`. The value of `num` and `last` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `last` is 0, `f` is a list with `g` appended to it**
