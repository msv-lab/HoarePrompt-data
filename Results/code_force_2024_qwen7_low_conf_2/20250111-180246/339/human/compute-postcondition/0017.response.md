The code `f.append(g)` appends the value of `g` to the list `f`. The previous state of `f` is a list with `g` appended to it, which means `f` contains at least `g`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than 1, `last` is 0, `f` is a list containing `g`, `g` is appended to `f`**
