Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `num` is greater than `last + 1`.
   - `last` is equal to `num - 1`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times and one additional `g`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `e` in `range(num - last)`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - From the initial states, we know:
     - `last = num - 1`
     - Therefore, `num - last = num - (num - 1) = 1`.
   - The loop runs for `e` in `range(1)`, meaning it will execute once if it starts.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - After the first iteration of the loop, `e` will be 0.
   - The loop condition will check `e < num - last`, which simplifies to `0 < 1`. This is true, so the loop can run again.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `e` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Since the loop runs based on `num - last`, and `num - last` remains 1, the loop will execute again if the condition is met.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `num` does not change, so it remains greater than `last + 1`.
   - `last` does not change, so it remains `num - 1`.
   - `f` does not change as the loop body is omitted, so it still contains `g` exactly `num + 1` times and one additional `g`.

Therefore, the updated state after the loop executes one more time will be:

**State: **`num` is greater than `last + 1`, `last` is equal to `num - 1`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times and one additional `g**, `e` is 1**.
