Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `e`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `num - last - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `num - last` must be at least 1 (i.e., `num > last`).

2. **Understand the Initial States:**
   - `num` is the new value corresponding to `i` in the set `S`.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times.
   - `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `num` and `last` are equal initially (`last = num`), the condition `num > last` cannot be satisfied because it would imply `num > num`, which is false.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust the initial state such that `num` is greater than `last` to allow the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the Adjusted State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `num` must be greater than `last`.
   - Hence, we need to adjust `num` to be greater than `last`.

Given these steps, the required adjustment to the initial state is:

**State: **`num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`**

Note: Since `last` is already equal to `num`, the only necessary adjustment is ensuring `num` is greater than `last`.
