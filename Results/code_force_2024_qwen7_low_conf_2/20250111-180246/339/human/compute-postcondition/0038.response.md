According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `e`. The loop will execute as long as `e` is less than `num - last`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the next element in set `S`
- `num` is greater than `last`
- `last` is equal to `num`
- `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last) + 1` times
- `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value

Given these conditions:
- `num` is equal to `last` because it was stated that `last` is equal to `num`.
- Therefore, `num - last` becomes `0`.
- Since `e` ranges from `0` to `num - last`, and `num - last` is `0`, the loop will not execute because there are no values of `e` that satisfy `0 < 0`.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, `num - last` needs to be greater than 0. This means `num` must be greater than `last`.

State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num - 1`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - (num - 1)) + 1 = num + 1 + 1 = num + 2` times, `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value**
