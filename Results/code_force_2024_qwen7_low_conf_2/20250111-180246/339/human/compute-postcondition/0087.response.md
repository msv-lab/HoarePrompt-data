Postcondition: ***`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[n]` reduced by 9 (3 + 3 from the initial reduction and 3 from the if part), `operations` is 3, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `health`. If `i < n - 1`, `current_health[n - 1]` is further reduced by 3.***
