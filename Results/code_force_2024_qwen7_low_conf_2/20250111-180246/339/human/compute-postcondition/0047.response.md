Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Condition**: The loop variable is `d`, and the loop iterates from `1` to `m` inclusive. The condition for the loop to continue is that `d < m + 1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `S` is a sorted version of `b` based on the second element of each tuple.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `bits` is a list of length `N+2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements each set to `1`, and ending with `0`.
   - `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists.
   - `f` is a list containing the elements of `g` repeated for each tuple in `S` based on the second element of the tuple.
   - `g` is `1`.
   - `last` is the last `num` value processed in the loop.
   - `i` is the last index processed in the loop.
   - The sum of the elements in the list generated by the list comprehension is printed.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `m` and continues as long as `d < m + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `d` must be equal to `m`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `d` needs to be incremented by 1, so `d` becomes `m + 1`.
   - However, since the loop condition is `d < m + 1`, the loop will stop when `d` is equal to `m + 1`.

4. **Updating the States**:
   - `ans` remains an empty list.
   - `S` remains the same.
   - `m` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).
   - `bits` remains the same.
   - `wtr` remains the same.
   - `f` remains the same.
   - `g` remains `1`.
   - `last` remains the last `num` value processed in the loop.
   - `i` remains the last index processed in the loop.
   - The sum of the elements in the list generated by the list comprehension is printed.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- The loop cannot execute one more time because the condition `d < m + 1` will no longer be true when `d` becomes `m + 1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`ans` is an empty list, `S` is a sorted version of `b` based on the second element of each tuple, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `bits` is a list of length `N+2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements each set to `1`, and ending with `0`, `wtr` is a list of `N` empty lists, `f` is a list containing the elements of `g` repeated for each tuple in `S` based on the second element of the tuple, `g` is `1`, `last` is the last `num` value processed in the loop, `i` is the last index processed in the loop, and the sum of the elements in the list generated by the list comprehension is printed.**
