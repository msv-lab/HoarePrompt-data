Postcondition: ***`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[n - 1]` reduced by 12 and `current_health[n - 2]` reduced by 3. If `i` < `n - 1`, then `current_health[n]` is reduced by 3. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, the state remains unchanged.***
