Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Loop Code Analysis
The loop iterates based on the condition `e in range(num - last)`. Given the initial conditions:
- `last` is initially `0`.
- `num` must be a positive integer (since the loop runs at least once).

Each iteration of the loop appends `g` to the list `f`.

### Iteration Observations
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `num` must be greater than 0.
  - `last` is 0.
  - `f` is a list with `g` appended to it.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `num` must be greater than 0.
  - `last` is 0.
  - `f` is a list containing `g`, and `g` is appended to `f` again.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `num` must be greater than 1.
  - `last` is 0.
  - `f` is a list containing `g` three times.

### General Pattern
- For every iteration, `g` is appended to `f`.
- Since the loop runs `num - last` times, and `last` starts at `0`, the loop will run `num` times in total.

### Final State After All Iterations
- `num` must be a positive integer.
- `last` remains `0` because the loop does not change `last` and it is never updated within the loop.
- `f` will contain `g` exactly `num` times.

### Output State
Given the analysis above, we can conclude the following:
- `num` must be a positive integer.
- `last` is `0`.
- `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times.

Thus, the output state of the loop after all iterations is:
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `last` is 0, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times.**
