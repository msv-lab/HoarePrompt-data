Postcondition: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with either `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 and `current_health[i - 1]` reduced by 6 if `i > 0`, or `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 if `i` is not greater than 0, `operations` is 1 (since it was incremented by 1), `i` is `n - 1`, and `n` is the length of `health`.**
