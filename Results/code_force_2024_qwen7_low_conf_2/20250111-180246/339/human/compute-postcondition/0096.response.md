Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list where each element `current_health[i]` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) is reduced by a multiple of 3 up to a maximum of 3*(n-1) (if all elements are greater than 0), `operations` is `2*n`, `i` is `n`, and `n` is the length of `health`. If any `current_health[i]` becomes less than or equal to 0, it remains unchanged.**
