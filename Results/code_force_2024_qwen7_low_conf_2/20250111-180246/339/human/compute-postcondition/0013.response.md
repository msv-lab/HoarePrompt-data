The code `f.append(g)` attempts to append the value of `g` to the list `f`. However, neither `f` nor `g` are defined in the initial state, and there are no assignments or definitions for these variables before the line of code. Therefore, this line of code will result in an error (specifically, a `NameError`), as both `f` and `g` are undefined.

Given the constraints of the task, since the code will not run successfully due to undefined variables, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state, as the variables `num` and `last` are not affected by the error.

Output State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `last` is 0**
