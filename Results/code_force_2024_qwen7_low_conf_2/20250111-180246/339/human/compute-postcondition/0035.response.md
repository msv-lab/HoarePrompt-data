`f` is appended with the list `g`. The value of `g` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, and `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value. The only change is that `g` is now included in the list `f`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times and `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value**
