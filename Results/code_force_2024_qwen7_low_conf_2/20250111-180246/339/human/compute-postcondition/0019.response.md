The code sets `last` to the value of `num`. The value of `num` remains unchanged, and the list `f` containing `g` exactly `num` times is also unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num` times.**
