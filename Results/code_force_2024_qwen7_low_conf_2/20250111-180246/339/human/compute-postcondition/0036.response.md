Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial States:**
   - `i` is the next element in set `S`.
   - `num` is greater than `last`.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times.
   - `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `e` in `range(num - last)`.
   - Since `last` is equal to `num`, the expression `num - last` simplifies to `0`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution:**
   - Given that `num - last` equals `0`, the range function will produce an empty range.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute at all because there are no values in the range.

4. **Determine Adjusted States:**
   - Since the loop does not execute, none of the variables related to the loop body will change.
   - The only variables that might change based on the given information are `i`, `num`, `last`, `f`, and `g`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The states do not need to be adjusted because the loop will not run.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times and `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value**
