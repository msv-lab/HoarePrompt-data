To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements of the for loop:

The loop is defined as:
```python
for e in range(num - last):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that the loop will iterate from 0 to `num - last - 1`. For this loop to execute, the expression `num - last` must be at least 1 (since the range function includes the start but excludes the stop). Therefore, we need to ensure that `num - last` is positive.

Let's review the given states and identify what needs to be adjusted:

1. **S**: Must contain at least one tuple.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

2. **ans**: Is an empty list.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

3. **b**: Is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an index and the corresponding value from list `a`.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

4. **m**: Is the maximum value from list `a`.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

5. **bits**: Is a list of length `N+2` starting with `0`, followed by `N` elements each set to `1`, and ending with `0`.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

6. **wtr**: Is a list of `N` empty lists.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

7. **f**: Is an empty list.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

8. **g**: Is `1`.
   - This state does not affect the loop condition `num - last`.

9. **last**: Is `0`.
   - The value of `last` will be compared with `num` to determine the number of iterations. Since `last` is `0`, we need to ensure that `num` is greater than `0` for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only state that needs adjustment is `num` to ensure that `num - last` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer
State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `last` is 0**
