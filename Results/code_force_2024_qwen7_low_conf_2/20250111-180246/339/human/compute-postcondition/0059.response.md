The code `current_health[i - 1] -= k` decreases the value of `current_health[i - 1]` by `k`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so `i - 1` is 3. Since `k` is 2, `current_health[3]` will be decreased by 2. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `k` remains 2
- `max_health` remains the same
- `health` and `current_health` are updated such that `current_health[3]` is decreased by 2
- `results` remains the same
- `operations` is 3
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 3

Output State: **`k` is 2, `max_health` remains the same, `health` and `current_health` are updated such that `current_health[3]` is decreased by 2, `results` remains the same, `operations` is 3, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 3.**
