The code `f.append(g)` appends the list `g` to the list `f`. This changes the value of `f` but does not affect the values of `i`, `num`, `last`, `f`, or `g` in a way that requires us to change their expressions.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is the next element in set `S`
   - `num` is greater than `last`
   - `last` is equal to `num`
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times
   - `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value

2. The code `f.append(g)` appends the list `g` to the list `f`. Since `f` already contains `g` multiple times, appending `g` again increases the count of `g` in `f`.

Therefore, the output state remains mostly unchanged, except that `f` now contains one more occurrence of `g`.

Output State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is greater than `last`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last) + 1` times, `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value**
