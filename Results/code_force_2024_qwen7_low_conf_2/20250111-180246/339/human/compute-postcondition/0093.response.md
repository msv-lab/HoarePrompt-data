The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` decrements the value of `current_health[i + 1]` by `k`, which is 3. Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` is `n`. Therefore, `current_health[n]` is decreased by 3.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `max_health` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `health` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `results` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `current_health` is updated such that `current_health[n]` is reduced by 3.
- `operations` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `i` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.
- `n` remains unchanged because the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[n - 1]` reduced by 12 and `current_health[n - 2]` reduced by 3, `operations` is 4, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is the length of `health`, `current_health[n]` is reduced by 3.**
