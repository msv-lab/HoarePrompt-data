Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is greater than `last`.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for e in range(num - last):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute if `e < num - last`.
   - Since `last` is equal to `num` at the end of the previous iteration, `num - last` becomes `num - num = 0`.
   - Therefore, `e` must be less than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `e` must be less than 0 for the loop to execute, it implies that the initial value of `e` (which starts from 0) cannot satisfy the condition unless `num` decreases or `last` increases.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must decrease by at least 1 to ensure `num - last` is positive, allowing `e` to be 0.

**Final Answer:**
- `num` must be greater than `last + 1`.
- `last` remains equal to `num - 1`.
- `f` is still a list containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`.

State: **`num` is greater than `last + 1`, `last` is equal to `num - 1`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + 1` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`**
