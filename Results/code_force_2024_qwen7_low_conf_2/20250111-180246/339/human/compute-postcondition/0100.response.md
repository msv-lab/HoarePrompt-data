The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of monsters, and `health`, which is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the health points of the i-th monster. The function returns a list `results` containing `2 * n` elements, where each element represents the number of operations performed when `k` equals the corresponding value from 1 to `max_health`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `health` (a list of positive integers), and returns a list `results` containing `2 * n` elements, each representing the number of operations when `k` ranges from 1 to `max_health`.**
