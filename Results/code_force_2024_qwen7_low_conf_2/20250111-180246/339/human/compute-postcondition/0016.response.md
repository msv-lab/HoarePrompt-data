According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num` and `last`. The loop runs as long as `e < num - last`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` must be greater than 0, `last` is 0, and `f` is a list with `g` appended to it.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Increment `e`:** Since `e` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop, if the loop is to execute again, `e` must be 1.
2. **Check `num - last`:** For the loop to continue, `num - last` must still be greater than `e`. Since `e` is now 1, `num - last` must be greater than 1.

Given that `last` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, `num` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `num` must be greater than 1, and `last` remains 0.

So, the updated states are:
- `num` must be greater than 1.
- `last` is 0.
- `f` remains a list with `g` appended to it (no change needed).

State: **`num` must be greater than 1, `last` is 0, `f` is a list with `g` appended to it**
