Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times.
   - `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over pairs `(i, num)` from set `S`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times.
   - `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next pair `(i, num)` from set `S` must be considered.
   - This means `i` must change to the next element in `S`, and `num` will be the corresponding value of `num` for that pair.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on the pair `(i, num)` from set `S`, the value of `i` will change to the next element, and `num` will be updated accordingly.
   - `last` remains unchanged as it was equal to `num` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `f` will still contain `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times, but now `num` will be different.
   - `g` will be updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value, where `i` is the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` changes to the next element in set `S`.
- `num` is the corresponding value of `num` for the new pair `(i, num)` from set `S`.
- `last` remains the same as it was equal to the previous `num`.
- `f` contains `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times.
- `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value, where `i` is the new value of `i`.

**State:**
- `i` is the next element in set `S`.
- `num` is the corresponding value of `num` for the new pair `(i, num)` from set `S`.
- `last` is equal to `num`.
- `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times.
- `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

Since the exact values of `i` and `num` depend on the specific set `S`, we cannot provide concrete numerical values without knowing `S`. However, the structure of the states should follow the above description.

State: **`i` is the next element in set `S`, `num` is the corresponding value of `num` for the new pair `(i, num)` from set `S`, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times, `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.**
