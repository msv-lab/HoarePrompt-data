Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`, and `bits[i + 1]` is 0.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet is: `g += bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`
   - Given that `bits[i + 1]` is 0, the expression simplifies to `g += bits[i] + 0 - 1`, which further simplifies to `g += bits[i] - 1`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its current value.
   - The values of `num`, `last`, and `f` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code.

4. **Output State**:
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is equal to `num`.
   - `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times.
   - `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer; `last` is equal to `num`; `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times; `g` is updated by adding `bits[i] - 1` to its previous value.**
