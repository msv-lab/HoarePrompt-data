The code snippet `current_health[i - 1] -= k` decrements the value of `current_health[i - 1]` by `k`. Given the initial state, `k` is 3, and `i` is `n`. Therefore, `current_health[n - 1]` will be reduced by 3.

The initial state is:
- `k` is 3
- `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list
- `health` is a list of positive integers
- `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value
- `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 and `current_health[i + 1]` reduced by 6 if `i < n - 1`, or `current_health[i]` reduced by 3 if `i` is not less than `n - 1`
- `operations` is 3
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is the length of `health`
- `current_health[n]` is `current_health[n] - 3`

After executing `current_health[i - 1] -= k`:
- `current_health[n - 1]` is reduced by 3, making it `current_health[n - 1] - 3`

The output state is:
**`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list with `current_health[n - 1]` reduced by 3, `current_health[n]` is `current_health[n] - 3`, `operations` is 3, `i` is `n`, `n` is the length of `health`**
