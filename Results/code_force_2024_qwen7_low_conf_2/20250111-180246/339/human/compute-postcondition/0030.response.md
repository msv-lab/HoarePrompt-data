The code `last = num` simply assigns the current value of `num` to `last`. The value of `num` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `last` now holds the same value as `num`.

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `last` is equal to `num`, `f` is a list containing `g` exactly `num + (num - last)` times, where `g` is defined as `g + bits[i] + bits[i + 2] - 1`**
