The code `current_health[i + 1] -= k` decrements the value of `current_health[i + 1]` by `k`. Given that `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. So, `current_health[5]` is decreased by `k`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here's the updated state:
- `k` is 2
- `max_health` remains the same
- `health` and `current_health` are updated such that `current_health[4]` is decreased by 2 (this part was mentioned in the initial state and does not get affected by this line of code)
- `results` remains the same
- `operations` is 3
- `i` is 4
- `n` must be greater than 3

Since `i` is 4 and `i > 0`, `current_health[3]` is additionally decreased by 2. So, `current_health[3]` is now `current_health[3] - 2`.

Output State: **`k` is 2, `max_health` remains the same, `health` and `current_health` are updated such that `current_health[4]` is decreased by 2 and `current_health[3]` is decreased by 2, `results` remains the same, `operations` is 3, `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 3.**
