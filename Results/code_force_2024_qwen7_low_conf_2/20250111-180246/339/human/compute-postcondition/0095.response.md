Postcondition: ***`k` is 3, `max_health` is the maximum value in the original `health` list, `health` is a list of positive integers, `results` is a list containing the updated `operations` value and the newly appended `operations` value, `current_health` is a shallow copy of the `health` list. If `current_health[i] > 0`, `current_health[i]` is reduced by 15 (`9 + 3 + 3`), and if `i < n - 1`, `current_health[n]` is further reduced by 3. If `current_health[i] <= 0`, the state remains unchanged.***
