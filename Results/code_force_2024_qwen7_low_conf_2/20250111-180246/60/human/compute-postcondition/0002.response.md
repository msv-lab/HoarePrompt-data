To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop to run.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `sequence` is `[x]`.
- `current_sum` is `x`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - `n` is within the specified range: \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `x` is within the specified range: \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `y` is within the specified range: \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s` is within the specified range: \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `sequence` is a list containing only one element, `x`: `sequence = [x]`.
   - `current_sum` is initialized to `x`: `current_sum = x`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers from `1` to `n-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `1`. This is because the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, so if `n` is `1`, the loop will not execute.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n > 1`.

### Final State Adjustments:
Given that `n` must be greater than `1` for the loop to execute, we adjust the state as follows:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x]`, `current_sum` is `x`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the condition \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
