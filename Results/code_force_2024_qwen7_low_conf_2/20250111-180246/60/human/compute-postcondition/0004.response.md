The code appends the value of the last element in `sequence` plus `y` to the list `sequence`. Initially, `sequence` is `[x, y]`, so the last element is `y`. Therefore, the new element appended to `sequence` is `y + y = 2y`. The value of `current_sum` remains unchanged because no operation modifies it directly.

The updated `sequence` will be `[x, y, 2y]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x, y, 2y]`, `current_sum` is `x + y + 2y = x + 3y`. Additionally, the current sum `current_sum` plus `y` is less than or equal to `s` and the difference between `s` and `current_sum` minus `y` is divisible by `y`.**
