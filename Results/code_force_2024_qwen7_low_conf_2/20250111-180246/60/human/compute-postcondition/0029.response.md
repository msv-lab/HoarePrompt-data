Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is a list containing elements based on the conditions within the loop, and `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence` up to the last appended element.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Conditions:**
   - `n`: Number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - `x`: Initial value added to `sequence` and `current_sum`.
   - `y`: Incremental value added when the condition is met.
   - `s`: Maximum allowed sum for `current_sum`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - At each iteration, the loop checks if `current_sum + y <= s` and if \((s - current_sum - y) \% y == 0\).
   - If the condition is met, `sequence` is extended by appending `sequence[-1] + y` and `current_sum` is incremented by `y`.
   - If the condition is not met, `sequence` is extended by appending `sequence[-1] \% y` and `current_sum` is incremented by `sequence[-1]`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - `sequence`: The list contains a series of values determined by the above conditions.
   - `current_sum`: The sum of all elements in `sequence`.
   - If the loop executes \(n-1\) times without `current_sum` exceeding `s` at any point, the final `sequence` will have `n` elements, starting with `x` and increasing by `y` or remaining the same modulo `y` based on the conditions.
   - If `current_sum` exceeds `s` at any point, the function returns `None`, and the loop terminates early.

Thus, the final output state reflects the values of `sequence` and `current_sum` after all iterations, adhering to the constraints and conditions within the loop.
