Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`. It generates a sequence of integers starting with `x` and then iteratively appends either `y` or the remainder of `current_sum % y` to the sequence. The sequence generation continues until either the sequence length reaches `n` or the cumulative sum `current_sum` exceeds `s`. If the cumulative sum equals `s` when the loop ends, the function returns the generated sequence. Otherwise, it returns `None`. Potential edge cases include when `s` is smaller than `x` or `y`, leading to early termination due to the cumulative sum exceeding `s`. The function also checks if `current_sum` exceeds `s` during each iteration, returning `None` if it does.**
