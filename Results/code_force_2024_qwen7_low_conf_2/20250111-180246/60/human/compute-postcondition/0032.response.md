Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is a list containing elements based on the conditions within the loop, and `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence` up to the last appended element. The current sum `current_sum` is not equal to `s`.**
