Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x, y]`, `current_sum` is `x + y`. Additionally, the current sum `current_sum` plus `y` is less than or equal to `s` and the difference between `s` and `current_sum` minus `y` is divisible by `y`.**
