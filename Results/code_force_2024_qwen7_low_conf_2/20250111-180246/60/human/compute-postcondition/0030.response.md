Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \cdot 1 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is a list containing elements based on the conditions within the loop, and `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence` up to the last appended element. The current value of `current_sum` is equal to `s`***
