`current_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum + y`. The previous value of `current_sum` was `current_sum`, which was the sum of the sequence up to the previous element. After adding `y`, `current_sum` now includes `y`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `x`, `s`, and `sequence`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(0 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is \(n-2\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is updated with the new element `sequence[-1] + y`, `current_sum` is `current_sum + y`**
