The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`. The parameter constraints are as follows: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.

Based on the given cases, the function returns a list 'sequence' under specific conditions, and the cumulative sum of these elements up to the last appended element is equal to `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`, and return a list 'sequence' where the cumulative sum of its elements equals `s`.
