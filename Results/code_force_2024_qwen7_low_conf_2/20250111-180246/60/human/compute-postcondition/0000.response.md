The code initializes a list `sequence` with the single element `x`. This means that the value of `x` is added to the list `sequence`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `sequence` is `[x]`**
