The code appends the next element in the sequence, which is calculated as the last element plus `y`. The last element of `sequence` is `[x, x % y]`, so the next element will be `x % y + y`.

Given that `sequence` is initially `[x, x % y]`, after appending the next element, the sequence will be `[x, x % y, x % y + y]`.

The `current_sum` is defined as `x + (x % y)`, which is the sum of the first two elements of the sequence. After appending the next element, the new `current_sum` will be the sum of the first three elements of the sequence.

Let's denote the updated sequence and current_sum:

- The updated `sequence` will be `[x, x % y, x % y + y]`.
- The updated `current_sum` will be `x + (x % y) + (x % y + y)`.

Simplifying `current_sum`:
\[ current\_sum = x + (x \% y) + (x \% y + y) = x + 2 \cdot (x \% y) + y \]

Since the conditions before the code execution are still valid and no other variables are affected, the output state will be as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x, x % y, x % y + y]`, `current_sum` is `x + 2 \cdot (x \% y) + y`, and the condition `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) holds, and `i` is `n`.**
