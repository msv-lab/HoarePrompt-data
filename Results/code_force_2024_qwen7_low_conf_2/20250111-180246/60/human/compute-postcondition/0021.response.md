Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - \( x \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - \( y \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - \( s \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - `sequence` and `current_sum` are adjusted based on specific conditions.
   - \( i \) is an integer such that \( i = n \).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `i` in the range `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).

3. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` should become \( n - 1 \).
   - Since `i` starts at \( n \), the condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` and `current_sum` are adjusted based on the conditions mentioned, and `i` is now \(n-1\)**.
