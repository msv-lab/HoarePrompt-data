The code `sequence.append(sequence[-1] % y)` appends the value of `sequence[-1] % y` to the list `sequence`. Here, `sequence[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `sequence`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `i` is now \(n-1\)

After the code executes, the new value for `sequence` will be the last element of `sequence` modulo `y` added to the end of the list.

Since the exact initial values of `sequence` are not specified, let's denote the last element of `sequence` before this operation as `last_element_of_sequence`.

The new last element of `sequence` will be `last_element_of_sequence % y`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `i` is now \(n-1\)
- `sequence` is the original sequence with its last element replaced by `last_element_of_sequence % y`

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `i` is now \(n-1\); `sequence` is the original sequence with its last element replaced by `last_element_of_sequence % y`**
