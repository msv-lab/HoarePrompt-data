The code updates `current_sum` by adding the last element of the `sequence` list, which is `sequence[-1]`. Given the initial state, `sequence` is `[x, x % y]`, so `sequence[-1]` is `x % y`.

The initial value of `current_sum` is `x`. After executing `current_sum += sequence[-1]`, `current_sum` becomes `x + (x % y)`.

We know from the initial state that the condition \(current_sum + y > s\) or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) holds. This condition remains unchanged because the code only modifies `current_sum`, and the rest of the variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `s`, `sequence`) remain unaffected.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:

- `current_sum` is now `x + (x % y)`
- The condition \(current_sum + y > s\) or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) still holds

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x, x % y]`, `current_sum` is `x + (x % y)`, and the condition \(current_sum + y > s\) or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) holds.**
