The code updates `current_sum` by adding the last element of `sequence`, which is replaced by `last_element_of_sequence % y`. The last element of `sequence` is `last_element_of_sequence % y`, and since `last_element_of_sequence` is the same as `sequence[-1]`, we update `current_sum` by adding `sequence[-1] % y`.

The initial state includes:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `i` is now \(n-1\)
- `sequence` is the original sequence with its last element replaced by `last_element_of_sequence % y`

After executing the code:
- `current_sum` is updated by adding `sequence[-1] % y`, which is `last_element_of_sequence % y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `i` is now \(n-1\), `sequence` is the original sequence with its last element replaced by `last_element_of_sequence % y`, and `current_sum` is increased by `sequence[-1] % y`.**
