Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x, x \% y]`, `current_sum` is \(x + (x \% y)\), and the condition `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) holds.**
