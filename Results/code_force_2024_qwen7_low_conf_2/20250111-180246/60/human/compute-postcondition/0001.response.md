The code initializes `current_sum` to the value of `x`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `current_sum` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and `y` is an integer such that 1 ≤ y ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `sequence` is `[x]`; `current_sum` is `x`**
