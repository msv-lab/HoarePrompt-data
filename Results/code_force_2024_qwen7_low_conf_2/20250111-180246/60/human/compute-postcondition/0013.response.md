According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts from `1` and iterates up to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` is `n-1`, and the condition `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) holds.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the next iteration:

1. The variable `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each time the loop runs.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
3. Since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented to `n` for the next iteration.
4. The condition `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) must still hold for the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:
- `i` should be updated to `n`.
- The condition `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) must still hold.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is `[x, x \% y]`, `current_sum` is \(x + (x \% y)\), and the condition `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0\) holds, and `i` is \(n\)**.
