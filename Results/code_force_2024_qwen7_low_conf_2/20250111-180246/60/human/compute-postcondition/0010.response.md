Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `current_sum` is greater than `s`, and either `current_sum + y > s` or \((s - current_sum - y) \% y \neq 0`\). The sequence is `[x, x \% y]` and `current_sum` is `x + (x \% y)`***
