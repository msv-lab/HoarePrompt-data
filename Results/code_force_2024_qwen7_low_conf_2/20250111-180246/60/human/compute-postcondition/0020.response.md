Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 < n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sequence `sequence` and `current_sum` are adjusted based on the following conditions: if `current_sum > s`, then `sequence` remains as `[x, x % y, x % y]` and `current_sum` remains as `x + 2 * (x % y)`. Otherwise, `sequence` is updated to `[x, x % y, x % y + y]` and `current_sum` to `x + 2 * (x % y) + 2 * y`. The variable `i` remains as `n`.***
