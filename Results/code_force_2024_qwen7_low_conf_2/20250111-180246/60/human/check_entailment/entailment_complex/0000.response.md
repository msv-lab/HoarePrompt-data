Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by generating a modular sequence that meets the specified conditions. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a sequence with the first element `x`.
   - It uses a loop to generate subsequent elements based on whether adding `y` or taking the modulo `y` would bring the cumulative sum closer to `s` without exceeding it.
   - The function checks if the cumulative sum `current_sum` exceeds `s` during each iteration and stops if it does.
   - After the loop, it checks if the cumulative sum equals `s`. If it does, the function returns the generated sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the scenario where the sequence length `n` is reached before the cumulative sum reaches `s`.
   - The function also ensures that the cumulative sum does not exceed `s` at any point during the generation of the sequence.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic inside the loop ensures that the sequence generation adheres to the modular sequence rules.
   - The function correctly returns `None` if no valid sequence can be formed.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to generate a modular sequence that sums to `s` if possible, and returns `None` otherwise. The overall structure and logic of the function match the problem statement requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
