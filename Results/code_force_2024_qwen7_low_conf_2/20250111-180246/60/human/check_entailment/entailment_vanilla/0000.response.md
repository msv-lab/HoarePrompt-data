Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and check if it aligns with the problem statement and requirements.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input and passes it to `func_1` for processing. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes the sequence with the starting value `x`.
   - It iteratively builds the sequence by either adding `y` or taking the modulus with `y` depending on the remaining sum `s - current_sum`.
   - It checks if the current sum exceeds `s` and returns `None` if it does, ensuring that the sequence sum stays within the limit.
   - After building the sequence, it checks if the total sum of the sequence equals `s`. If it does, it returns the sequence; otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - If `func_1` returns a sequence, the program prints "Yes" followed by the sequence.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, the program prints "No".

Let's verify if the logic handles all edge cases as per the problem statement:

- **Edge Case 1**: When `x = 0` and `y = 1`, the sequence should always be `[0, 0, ..., 0]` with the sum being `0`. The function correctly handles this by checking if the sum matches.
- **Edge Case 2**: When `y` is very large and `x` and `s` are small, the sequence should be constructed using only `x % y` and `x + y`. The function correctly handles this by checking the sum and appending the appropriate values.
- **Edge Case 3**: When `s` is very small and the sequence needs to be built incrementally without exceeding `s`. The function correctly checks the sum at each step and avoids exceeding `s`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
