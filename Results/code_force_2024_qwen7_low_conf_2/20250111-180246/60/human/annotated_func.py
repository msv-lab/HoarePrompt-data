#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, x, y, s):
    sequence = [x]
    current_sum = x
    for i in range(1, n):
        if current_sum + y <= s and (s - current_sum - y) % y == 0:
            sequence.append(sequence[-1] + y)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `y` is an integer such that \(1 \leq y \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `sequence` is a list containing elements based on the conditions within the loop, and `current_sum` is the cumulative sum of the elements in `sequence` up to the last appended element.
    if (current_sum == s) :
        return sequence
        #The program returns the list 'sequence' which contains elements based on the conditions within the loop, and the cumulative sum of these elements up to the last appended element is equal to 's'
    else :
        return None
        #None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `s`. It generates a sequence of integers starting with `x` and then iteratively appends either `y` or the remainder of `current_sum % y` to the sequence. The sequence generation continues until either the sequence length reaches `n` or the cumulative sum `current_sum` exceeds `s`. If the cumulative sum equals `s` when the loop ends, the function returns the generated sequence. Otherwise, it returns `None`. Potential edge cases include when `s` is smaller than `x` or `y`, leading to early termination due to the cumulative sum exceeding `s`. The function also checks if `current_sum` exceeds `s` during each iteration, returning `None` if it does.
