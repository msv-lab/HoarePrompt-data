According to the code, the loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
- `V` is a list of binary strings
- `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`
- The current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`
- The length of `s` is `n` or `n`
- `valid` is `False` if `sub_s.count('1')` does not match any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`
- `j` is 1
- `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 2.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `V`, `S`, `s`, `valid`, and `sub_s`) remain unchanged because the problem statement specifies that the postcondition does not change in the if part and the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n` or `n`, `valid` is `False` if `sub_s.count('1')` does not match any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`, `j` is 2, and `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`**
