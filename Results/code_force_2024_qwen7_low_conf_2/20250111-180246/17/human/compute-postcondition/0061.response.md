Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is 1.
   - \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \).
   - \( V \) is a list of binary strings.
   - \( S \) is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`.
   - The current value of \( s \) is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`.
   - The length of \( s \) is \( n \).
   - \( valid \) is `True` because there is no substring \( sub_s \) such that the count of '1's in \( sub_s \) matches any integer representation of the binary strings in \( V \).
   - \( j \) is \( n \).
   - \( sub_s \) is an empty string.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(2 ** n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop will iterate from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = 2^n - 1 \).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is 1.
   - Therefore, the next value of \( i \) will be \( 2 \).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since \( i \) will be incremented to 2, the only state that needs to be adjusted is \( i \).
   - All other states should remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop increment.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - \( i \) is now 2.
   - \( n \) remains the same.
   - \( V \) remains the same.
   - \( S \) remains the same.
   - \( s \) remains the same.
   - \( valid \) remains `True`.
   - \( j \) remains \( n \).
   - \( sub_s \) remains an empty string.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, `valid` is `True` because there is no substring `sub_s` such that the count of '1's in `sub_s` matches any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string.**
