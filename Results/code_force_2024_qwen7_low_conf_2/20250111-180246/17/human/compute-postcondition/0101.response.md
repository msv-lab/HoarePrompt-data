Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where 0 ≤ v_i < 2^{n+1}. It generates all binary strings of length `n` that meet specific criteria and then sorts these strings. For each valid binary string, it checks if removing any single bit results in a binary string that corresponds to an integer present in `V`. If a binary string meets this criterion, it is included in the result list `S`. Finally, it prints the count of valid binary strings followed by their decimal equivalents.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 1, the function will generate binary strings "0" and "1". The binary string "1" will be valid because removing its only bit does not leave a string in `V`.
- If no binary string meets the criteria, the list `S` will remain empty.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation mentions that `i` is `2^n - 1` and `j` is `n` after the for loop, but these variables are not used in the final output or logic. Thus, their presence in the postcondition annotations is unnecessary.
