Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed, and `valid` remains `False`. If `s[j]` is not '1', the condition holds true. If `s[j]` is '1', `valid` remains `False` unless `sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2)` for any value `v` in `V`, in which case `valid` would become `True`, but since the if part states that if none of the values in `V` satisfy the condition, `valid` remains `False`.***
