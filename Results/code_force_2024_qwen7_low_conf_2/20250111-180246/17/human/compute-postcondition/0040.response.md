Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`, the length of `s` is `n-1`, `valid` is `True`, `j` is `0`, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`, and the count of '1's in `sub_s` is not equal to any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`.***
