The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since the given code snippet only contains a `break` statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `sub_s` is the string obtained by removing the character at index `j` from `s`, and `valid` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
