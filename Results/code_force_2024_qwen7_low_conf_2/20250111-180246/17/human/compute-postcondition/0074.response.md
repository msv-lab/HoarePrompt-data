According to the given for loop statement, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
- `V` is a list of binary strings
- `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`
- The current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value
- The current value of `j` is less than `n`
- `sub_s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value
- `valid` is `False` if the count of `'1'` in `sub_s` is not equal to the binary representation of any string in `V`, otherwise `valid` remains `True`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `j` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented to `j + 1`.
3. Since `j` was less than `n`, `j + 1` should now be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the new state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `sub_s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value, and `valid` is `False` if the count of `'1'` in `sub_s` is not equal to the binary representation of any string in `V`, otherwise `valid` remains `True`.**
