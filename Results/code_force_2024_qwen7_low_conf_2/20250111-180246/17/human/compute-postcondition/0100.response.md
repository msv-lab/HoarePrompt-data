The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `V`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and `V` is a list of 2^n - 1 integers where 0 ≤ v_i < 2^{n+1}. The function does not specify a particular return value directly but instead describes cases based on the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and a list `V` of the specified length and values, without explicitly stating the return value but rather providing conditions based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where 0 ≤ v_i < 2^{n+1}.**
