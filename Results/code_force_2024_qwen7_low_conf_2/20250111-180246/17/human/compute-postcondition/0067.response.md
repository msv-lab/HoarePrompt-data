Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '10'` if `len(s) < n` or `'10'` otherwise, `valid` is `True`, the current value of `j` is less than `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string, `valid` is `True`, and the current value of `s[j]` is `'1'`**
