`i` is set to 1 initially, and the variable `s` is reassigned the binary representation of `i` without the '0b' prefix. Since `i` is 1, its binary representation is '1'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is `'1'`, the length of `s` is 1, and `valid` is `True`. `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string since `j` will be `n` and removing the character at index `n` from `s` (which is `'1'`) results in an empty string.**
