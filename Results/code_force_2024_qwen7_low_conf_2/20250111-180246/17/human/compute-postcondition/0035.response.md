Postcondition: ***`i` is 1; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of binary strings; `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`; the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`; the length of `s` is `n` or `n`; `valid` is `True`; `j` is `n`; `sub_s` is an empty string.***
