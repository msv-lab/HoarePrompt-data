The code `sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]` removes the character at index `j` from the string `s`. Given the initial conditions, the current value of `s` is `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'`, and the current character of `s` at index `j` is `'1'`. This means `s` looks like `'000...01'` (with `n-1` zeros followed by a single '1') and `j` is set to `n-1` because the '1' is at the last position.

When we remove the '1' at index `j` from `s`, `sub_s` will be `'000...0'` (with `n-1` zeros). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`, the length of `s` is `n-1`, `valid` is `True`, `j` is `0`, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`**
