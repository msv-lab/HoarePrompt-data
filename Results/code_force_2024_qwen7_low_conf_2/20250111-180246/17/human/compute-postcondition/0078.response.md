Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `sub_s` is the string obtained by removing the character at index `j` from `s`, and `valid` is `False`. If the count of `'1'` in `sub_s` is not equal to the binary representation of any string in `V`, `valid` remains `False`. There is no change in the else part since it does not provide any new conditions.**
