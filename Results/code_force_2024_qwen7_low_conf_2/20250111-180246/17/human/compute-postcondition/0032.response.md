According to the given code, the loop depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `2 ** n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than \(2^n\).

Given that `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 1.

The other variables (`n`, `V`, `S`, `s`, `valid`, and `j`) do not change based on the loop condition and remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the updated states are:
- `i` is now 1.
- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `V` remains a list of binary strings.
- `S` remains a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`.
- `s` remains `'0' * n`.
- `valid` remains `True`.
- `j` remains `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True`. `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed (which means it becomes an empty string since `j` will be `n`).**
