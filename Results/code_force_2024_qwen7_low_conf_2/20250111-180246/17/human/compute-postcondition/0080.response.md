According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are known:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
- `V` is a list of binary strings
- `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`
- The current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`
- `sub_s` is the string obtained by removing the character at index `j` from `s`
- `valid` is `False`

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `j` is currently less than or equal to `n`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Here are the adjusted states:

- `i` remains 2
- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
- `V` remains a list of binary strings
- `S` remains a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`
- The current value of `s` remains the same as it was before the loop iteration
- The current value of `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `j + 1`
- `sub_s` remains the string obtained by removing the character at index `j` from `s`
- `valid` remains `False`

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, `sub_s` is the string obtained by removing the character at index `j` from `s`, and `valid` is `False`.
