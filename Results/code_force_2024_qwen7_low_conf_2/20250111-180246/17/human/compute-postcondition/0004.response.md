Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings where each string represents the binary form of the original integers in `V` without the '0b' prefix, `S` is an empty list, the current value of `s` is '0', and the length of `s` is less than `n`**
