Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed.
   - If the count of '1' in `sub_s` when converted from binary matches any value in `V`, `valid` remains False; otherwise, `valid` remains False.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.
   - Therefore, the loop condition depends on `j` and `n`.

3. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1, making it `j = 2`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `j` will be updated to 2.
   - `sub_s` will remain the same since the loop body does not modify it.
   - The condition for `valid` remains the same as there is no modification to `sub_s` or `V` in the loop body.

5. **Updated State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `sub_s` is still the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed.
   - The condition for `valid` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is 2, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed, if the count of '1' in `sub_s` when converted from binary matches any value in `V`, `valid` remains False; otherwise, `valid` remains False.**
