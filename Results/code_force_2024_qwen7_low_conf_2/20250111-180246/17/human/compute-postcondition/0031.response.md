Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True`. `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed (which means it becomes an empty string since `j` will be `n`).*** 

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we assume that the condition `valid` being true leads to the specified changes in the variables as mentioned in the if part. Therefore, the postcondition directly reflects the state after the execution of the if block, which is the same as the if part's postcondition since there is no alternative action in the else part.
