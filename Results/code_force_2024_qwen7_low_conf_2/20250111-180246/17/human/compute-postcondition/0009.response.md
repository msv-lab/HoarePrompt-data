Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True`. `j` is 0, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1'.**
