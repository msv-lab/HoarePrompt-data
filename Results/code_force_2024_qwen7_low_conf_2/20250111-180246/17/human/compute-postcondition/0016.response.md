Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
   - `V` is a list of binary strings
   - `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`
   - The current value of `s` is `'0' * n`
   - The length of `s` is `n`
   - `valid` is either `False` or remains unchanged
   - `j` is 0
   - `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)` if `s[j]` equals '1'. Otherwise, `sub_s` remains `'0' * n`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 1.
   - The condition `j < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:

- `j` should be incremented by 1, so it becomes 1.
- `sub_s` will depend on the value of `s[j]`:
  - If `s[1]` equals '1', then `sub_s` will be `'0' * (n-1)`.
  - Otherwise, `sub_s` will remain `'0' * n`.

Since no other variables or lists are directly modified within the loop based on the information given, we only need to adjust `j` and `sub_s`.

**Final State:**
- `j` is 1
- `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)` if `s[1]` equals '1'. Otherwise, `sub_s` remains `'0' * n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, `valid` is either `False` or remains unchanged, `j` is 1, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)` if `s[1]` equals '1'. Otherwise, `sub_s` remains `'0' * n`.**
