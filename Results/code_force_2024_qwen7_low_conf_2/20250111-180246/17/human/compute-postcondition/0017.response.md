The code updates the value of `sub_s` by removing the character at index `j` from the string `s`. Given the initial state, we need to consider two cases for `sub_s`:

1. If `s[1]` equals '1', then `sub_s = '0' * (n-1)`.
2. Otherwise, `sub_s` remains `'0' * n`.

Let's analyze both cases:

### Case 1: `s[1]` equals '1'
- Initial State: `j` is 1, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)`.
- After the code execution: `sub_s = s[:1] + s[2:]`, which means `sub_s` becomes the string `s` without the character at index 1.

### Case 2: `s[1]` does not equal '1'
- Initial State: `j` is 1, `sub_s` is `'0' * n`.
- After the code execution: `sub_s = s[:1] + s[2:]`, which means `sub_s` becomes the string `s` without the character at index 1.

In both cases, the value of `sub_s` after the code execution is the same, which is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`j` is 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed.**
