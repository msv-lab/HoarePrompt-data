Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
- `V` is a list of binary strings
- `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`
- The current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`
- The length of `s` is `n` or `n`
- `valid` is `True`
- `j` is `n`
- `sub_s` is an empty string

### For Loop:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`.
   - Since `j` is initialized to `n` in the given state, we need to adjust `j` to start from `0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.
   - Given that `j` is currently `n`, the condition `j < n` is false, and thus the loop will not execute initially.

### Adjusted States:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `j` to `0` to start the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n` or `n`, `valid` is `True`, `j` is `0`, `sub_s` is an empty string**.
