Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is either `False` or remains unchanged. `j` is 0, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)'.***

Explanation:
- If the condition `not any((sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V))` is true, then `valid` is set to `False`.
- If the condition is false, `valid` remains unchanged (`True`).

Since there is no `else` part in the code snippet provided, the postcondition for `valid` depends solely on the evaluation of the if condition.
