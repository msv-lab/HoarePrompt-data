The code `s = bin(i)[2:]` converts the integer `i` to its binary representation using the `bin` function and then slices off the '0b' prefix. Since `i` is initially 0, the binary representation of `i` is also '0'. Therefore, `s` is assigned the value '0'.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings where each string represents the binary form of the original integers in `V` without the '0b' prefix, `S` is an empty list, `s` is '0'**
