Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, `valid` is `False`, `j` is 2, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`. If `sub_s.count('1')` does not match any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`, `valid` remains `False`.***
