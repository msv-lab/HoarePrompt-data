The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or the most internal if statement. In this case, since there is no loop or if statement provided, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values or the state of the program. The variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, `valid` is `False`, `j` is 2, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)'**
