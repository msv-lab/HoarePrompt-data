Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, `valid` is `True` because there is no substring `sub_s` such that the count of '1's in `sub_s` matches any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string.***
