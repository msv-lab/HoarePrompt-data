Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is either `False` or remains unchanged. `j` is 0, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)' if `s[j]` equals '1'. Otherwise, `sub_s` remains `'0' * n'.***
