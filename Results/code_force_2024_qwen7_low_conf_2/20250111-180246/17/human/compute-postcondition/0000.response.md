The code `V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]` converts each integer in the list `V` from its decimal form to binary form, removing the '0b' prefix.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\) and `V` is a list of \(2^n - 1\) integers where \(0 \leq v_i < 2^{n+1}\), let's analyze the effect of the code:

1. `V` is initially a list of \(2^n - 1\) integers.
2. The code iterates over each element `i` in `V` and converts it to its binary representation without the '0b' prefix.

For example, if `n` is 3 (a specific value within the range), `V` would have \(2^3 - 1 = 7\) elements, and these elements are converted to their binary representations. 

If `n` is 3, `V` could be `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. After running the code, each of these integers would be converted to binary, resulting in the list `['0', '1', '10', '11', '100', '101', '110']`.

However, since the exact values of `V` are not specified, we can generalize the transformation. Each element in `V` will be replaced by its binary representation without the '0b' prefix.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `V` is now a list of binary strings corresponding to the original integers in `V`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of binary strings where each string represents the binary form of the original integers in `V` without the '0b' prefix.**
