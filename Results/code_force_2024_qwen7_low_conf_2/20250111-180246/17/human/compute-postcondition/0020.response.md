Postcondition: **`j` is 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed; `valid` is False if none of the values in `V` match the count of '1' in `sub_s` when converted from binary. If any value in `V` matches, `valid` remains unchanged (which is False in this context as per the if part postcondition).**
