The given code initializes an empty list `S`. This means that the list `S` is created, but its elements are not defined yet. The values of `n` and `V` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `S` is an empty list while keeping the original values of `n` and `V`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\); `V` is a list of binary strings where each string represents the binary form of the original integers in `V` without the '0b' prefix; `S` is an empty list**
