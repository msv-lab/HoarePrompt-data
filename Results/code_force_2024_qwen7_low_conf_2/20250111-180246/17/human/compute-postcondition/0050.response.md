Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n` or `n`, `valid` is `False` if `sub_s.count('1')` does not match any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`, `j` is 1, and `sub_s` is `'0' * (n - 1)`. Since the condition `s[j] == '1'` is checked and the postcondition does not change in the if part, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition and the if part postcondition.***
