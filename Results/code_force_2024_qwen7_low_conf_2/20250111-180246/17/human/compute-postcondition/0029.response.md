Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True`. `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed (which means it becomes an empty string since `j` will be `n`).**
