The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `j`, `sub_s`, and `valid`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since there is no loop or if statement mentioned in the initial state, the variable values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed, `valid` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
