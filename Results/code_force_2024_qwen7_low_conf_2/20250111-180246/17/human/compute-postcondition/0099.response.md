Output State: **`i` is `2^n - 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings of length `n`, the current value of `s` is the last binary string in `S`, `valid` is `True` if the conditions inside the loop are met, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string, and the integer equivalent of each binary string in `S` (its decimal values) has been printed.**
