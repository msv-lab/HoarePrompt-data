Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n` and the second element is `'1'`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 1) + '1'` or `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n` or `n`, `valid` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the count of '1's in `sub_s` matches any integer representation of the binary strings in `V`, `j` is `0`, `sub_s` is either an empty string or `'0' * (n - 1)`. If `s[j]` is `'1'`, the count of '1's in `sub_s` is checked against the binary strings in `V`; if it does not match, `valid` is set to `False`; otherwise, `valid` remains `True`.***
