The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables `j`, `sub_s`, and `valid` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is 1; `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index 1 removed; `valid` is False.**
