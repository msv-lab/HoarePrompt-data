Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the second element is `'1'`, and the third element is `'1' * n`, the current value of `s` is either `'0' * (n - 2) + '0'` or the original value, the current value of `j` is `j + 1`, `sub_s` is the string obtained by removing the character at index `j` from `s`, and `valid` is `True` if there exists a string in `V` such that the count of '1's in `sub_s` equals the integer value of the string in `binary`, otherwise `valid` remains `False`.***
