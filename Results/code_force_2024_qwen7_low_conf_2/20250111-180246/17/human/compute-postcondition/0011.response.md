Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list where the first element is `'0' * n`, the current value of `s` is `'0' * n`, the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True`. `j` is 0, `sub_s` is `'0' * (n-1)'. The condition is met as no sub_s count equals any binary string in V.**
