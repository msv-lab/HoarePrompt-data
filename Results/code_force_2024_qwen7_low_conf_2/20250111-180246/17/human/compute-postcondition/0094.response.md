The code snippet `print(int(s, 2))` converts the binary string `s` to an integer using base 2 and prints it. Since `s` is a binary string representing the integer `i` (i.e., `bin(i)[2:]`), converting it back to an integer should yield the original value of `i`, which is `2^n - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `2^n - 1`
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)
- `V` is a list of binary strings
- `S` must contain at least one valid binary string, the current value of `s` is a binary string of length `n` representing the integer `i` (i.e., `bin(i)[2:]`)
- `S` is a list containing at least one binary string representation of `i`
- `valid` is `True` if the conditions inside the loop are met
- `j` is `n`
- `sub_s` is an empty string

The code snippet only affects the printing of `s` as an integer, which is `2^n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `2^n - 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` contains at least one binary string, the current value of `s` is a binary string of length `n` representing the integer `i` (i.e., `bin(i)[2:]`), `valid` is `True` if the conditions inside the loop are met, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string, and `2^n - 1` is printed.**
