You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Define the binary encoding of a finite set of natural numbers T \subseteq
\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\} as f(T) = \sum\limits_{i \in T} 2^i . For example,
f(\\{0,2\\}) = 2^0 + 2^2 = 5 and f(\\{\\}) = 0 . Notice that f is a bijection
from all such sets to all non-negative integers. As such, f^{-1} is also
defined.

You are given an integer n along with 2^n-1 sets V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_{2^n-1} .

Find all sets S that satisfy the following constraint:

  * S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} . Note that S can be empty. 
  * For all non-empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} , |S \cap T| \in V_{f(T)} . 

Due to the large input and output, both input and output will be given in
terms of binary encodings of the sets.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20 ).

The second line of input contains 2^n-1 integers v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{2^n-1} (0
\leq v_i < 2^{n+1} ) — the sets V_i given in their binary encoding where V_i =
f^{-1}(v_i) .

Output

The first line of output should contain an integer k indicating the number of
possible S .

In the following k lines, you should output f(S) for all possible S in
increasing order.

Note

In the first test case, one possible S is f^{-1}(3) = \\{0,1\\} . All the non-
empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,2\\} and the corresponding |S \cap T| , f(T)
and V_f(T) are as follows:

T | |S\cap T| | f(T) | V_{f(T)}   
---|---|---|---  
\\{0\\} | 1 | 1 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1\\} | 1 | 2 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{2\\} | 0 | 4 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1\\} | 2 | 3 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,2\\} | 1 | 5 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1,2\\} | 1 | 6 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1,2\\} | 2 | 7 | \\{2,3\\}
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import itertools

print('Test Case 1:')
func_1(3, [15] * 7)
print('\nTest Case 2:')
func_1(5, [63] * 16)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and V is a list of 2^n - 1 integers where 0 ≤ v_i < 2^{n+1}.
def func_1(n, V):
    V = [bin(i)[2:] for i in V]
    S = []
    for i in range(2 ** n):
        s = bin(i)[2:]
        
        if len(s) < n:
            s = '0' * (n - len(s)) + s
        
        valid = True
        
        for j in range(n):
            if s[j] == '1':
                sub_s = s[:j] + s[j + 1:]
                if not any(sub_s.count('1') == int(v, 2) for v in V):
                    valid = False
                    break
        
        if valid:
            S.append(bin(int(s, 2) + 1)[2:])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `2^n - 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings generated according to the rules within the loop, the current value of `s` is a binary string of length `n` representing the integer `i` (i.e., `bin(i)[2:]`), the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True` if the conditions inside the loop are met. `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed (which means it becomes an empty string since `j` will be `n`). If the loop does not execute (i.e., `i` is less than 0), `S` remains empty.
    S.sort()
    print(len(S))
    for s in S:
        print(int(s, 2))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `2^n - 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings of length `n`, the current value of `s` is the last binary string in `S`, `valid` is `True` if the conditions inside the loop are met, `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is an empty string, and the integer equivalent of each binary string in `S` (its decimal values) has been printed.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
