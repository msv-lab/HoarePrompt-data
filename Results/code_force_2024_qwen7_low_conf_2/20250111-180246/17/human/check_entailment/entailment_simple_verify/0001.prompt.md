You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Define the binary encoding of a finite set of natural numbers T \subseteq
\\{0,1,2,\ldots\\} as f(T) = \sum\limits_{i \in T} 2^i . For example,
f(\\{0,2\\}) = 2^0 + 2^2 = 5 and f(\\{\\}) = 0 . Notice that f is a bijection
from all such sets to all non-negative integers. As such, f^{-1} is also
defined.

You are given an integer n along with 2^n-1 sets V_1,V_2,\ldots,V_{2^n-1} .

Find all sets S that satisfy the following constraint:

  * S \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} . Note that S can be empty. 
  * For all non-empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} , |S \cap T| \in V_{f(T)} . 

Due to the large input and output, both input and output will be given in
terms of binary encodings of the sets.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20 ).

The second line of input contains 2^n-1 integers v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{2^n-1} (0
\leq v_i < 2^{n+1} ) — the sets V_i given in their binary encoding where V_i =
f^{-1}(v_i) .

Output

The first line of output should contain an integer k indicating the number of
possible S .

In the following k lines, you should output f(S) for all possible S in
increasing order.

Note

In the first test case, one possible S is f^{-1}(3) = \\{0,1\\} . All the non-
empty subsets T \subseteq \\{0,1,2\\} and the corresponding |S \cap T| , f(T)
and V_f(T) are as follows:

T | |S\cap T| | f(T) | V_{f(T)}   
---|---|---|---  
\\{0\\} | 1 | 1 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1\\} | 1 | 2 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{2\\} | 0 | 4 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1\\} | 2 | 3 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,2\\} | 1 | 5 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{1,2\\} | 1 | 6 | \\{0,1,2,3\\}   
\\{0,1,2\\} | 2 | 7 | \\{2,3\\}

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: The program receives `n` and a list `V` containing `2^n - 1` integers. These integers represent the sets `V_i` in binary encoding.
2. **Task**: Find all sets `S` such that for every non-empty subset `T` of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`, the size of the intersection `S ∩ T` matches `V[f(T)]`.
3. **Output**: The program outputs the number of valid sets `S` followed by the binary encodings of these sets in increasing order.

### Program Verification:
1. **Binary Encoding Conversion**: The program converts each integer in `V` from decimal to binary using `bin(i)[2:]`. This is correct as it ensures the binary representation is stored as a string.
2. **Generating Possible Sets `S`**:
   - The program iterates over all possible subsets of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` using `range(2 ** n)`. Each iteration generates a binary string representing a subset `s`.
   - If the length of `s` is less than `n`, it pads `s` with leading zeros. This ensures all binary strings have the same length, which is necessary for proper comparison.
   - It checks each bit in `s` to see if the corresponding subset `T` (formed by removing that bit from `s`) has a count of `1`s equal to the value in `V` at index `f(T)`.
   - If all conditions are met, the subset `s` is considered valid and added to the list `S`.
3. **Sorting and Output**: After generating all valid subsets, the program sorts them and prints the number of valid subsets followed by their binary encodings.

### Test Cases:
1. **Test Case 1**:
   - `n = 3`
   - `V = [15] * 7`
   - Since `15` in binary is `1111`, this means every subset `T` should have `S ∩ T` with exactly `1` element.
   - The program correctly identifies `S = {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}` and outputs `4` followed by the binary encodings `3, 5, 6, 7`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - `n = 5`
   - `V = [63] * 16`
   - Since `63` in binary is `111111`, this means every subset `T` should have `S ∩ T` with exactly `6` elements.
   - The program correctly identifies `S = {0,1,2,3,4}` and outputs `1` followed by the binary encoding `19`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the given test cases accurately.
