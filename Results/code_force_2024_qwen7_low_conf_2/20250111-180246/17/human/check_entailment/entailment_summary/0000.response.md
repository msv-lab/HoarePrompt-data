Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find all subsets \( S \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\} \) such that for every non-empty subset \( T \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,n-1\} \), the size of the intersection \( |S \cap T| \) must equal \( V_{f(T)} \). Here, \( f(T) \) is the binary encoding of the set \( T \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Input Processing**: The function first converts the list `V` from integers to binary strings.
   - **Generating Binary Strings**: It generates all binary strings of length `n` representing subsets of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\).
   - **Validation Check**: For each binary string `s`, it checks if removing any single bit still matches some value in `V`. This is done by checking the count of `1`s in all substrings formed by removing one bit at a time.
   - **Result Construction**: If a binary string passes the validation check, it is added to the result list `S`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the number of valid binary strings followed by their decimal equivalents.

3. **Execution Summary Matching**:
   - The code correctly processes the input as a list of binary encodings of sets.
   - It correctly generates all possible subsets of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\) as binary strings.
   - It validates each binary string according to the specified criteria using the `V` values.
   - The output format matches the requirement of printing the count of valid sets followed by their decimal representations.

Given the analysis, the provided code accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.
