    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `2^n - 1`, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `V` is a list of binary strings, `S` is a list containing all valid binary strings generated according to the rules within the loop, the current value of `s` is a binary string of length `n` representing the integer `i` (i.e., `bin(i)[2:]`), the length of `s` is `n`, and `valid` is `True` if the conditions inside the loop are met. `j` is `n`, `sub_s` is the string `s` with the character at index `j` removed (which means it becomes an empty string since `j` will be `n`). If the loop does not execute (i.e., `i` is less than 0), `S` remains empty.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 and a list `V` of 2^n - 1 integers where 0 ≤ v_i < 2^{n+1}. It generates all binary strings of length `n` that meet specific criteria and then sorts these strings. For each valid binary string, it checks if removing any single bit results in a binary string that corresponds to an integer present in `V`. If a binary string meets this criterion, it is included in the result list `S`. Finally, it prints the count of valid binary strings followed by their decimal equivalents.
