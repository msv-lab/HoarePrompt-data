Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N` within the specified range. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond returning one of these three values based on the value of `N`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the specific cases where `N` is 1 and 2 correctly.
- For any other value of `N` within the range 1 to \(10^9\), the function always returns 714285638, which means it does not differentiate between other values within this range.
- The function does not handle cases outside the specified range (i.e., values less than 1 or greater than \(10^9\)). If such values were passed, the behavior would not be defined by the provided code.
