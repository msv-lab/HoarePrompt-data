#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer, and p is a prime number (in this case, p is 999999893, as specified in the problem statement).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `a` and a prime number `p` (specifically 999999893). It computes and returns the result of \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\) using modular exponentiation. This computation is performed efficiently using the `pow` function with three arguments: the base `a`, the exponent `p - 2`, and the modulus `p`. The function does not handle any edge cases beyond ensuring that the input `a` is a positive integer and `p` is the specific prime number 999999893. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has returned the computed value \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^9.
def func_2(N):
    if (N == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        if (N == 2) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            return 714285638
            #The program returns 714285638
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N` within the specified range. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond returning one of these three values based on the value of `N`.
