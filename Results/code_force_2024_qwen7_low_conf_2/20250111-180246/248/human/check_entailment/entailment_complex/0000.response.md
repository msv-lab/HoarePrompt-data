### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the program, we need to analyze whether the provided functions correctly solve the given problem and produce the expected outputs.

1. **Problem Analysis:**
   - We start with a square piece of paper with a side length of 1 unit.
   - Each operation involves folding each corner to the center, reducing the side length to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
   - After \(N\) operations, we calculate the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\), where \(M\) is the sum of the lengths of all mountain crease lines, and \(V\) is the sum of the lengths of all valley crease lines.
   - This value can be expressed as \(A + B\sqrt{2}\), where \(B\) is reduced to an irreducible fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\).
   - We need to compute \(p \cdot \text{inv}(q) \mod 999999893\), where \(\text{inv}(q)\) is the modular inverse of \(q\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function computes \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\).
   - Given that \(999999893\) is a large prime, this function correctly uses modular exponentiation.
   - However, there is no apparent connection between this function and solving the main problem. This function is not used in the main logic.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function takes an integer \(N\) and returns a fixed value based on \(N\):
     - \(0\) if \(N = 1\)
     - \(1\) if \(N = 2\)
     - \(714285638\) for any other \(N\)
   - This function does not reflect the actual calculation of \(\frac{M}{V}\) for any \(N\).

4. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads input, processes each test case using `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - Since `func_2` does not correctly compute the required value, the program will not produce the correct output for any \(N > 2\).

### Conclusion:
The provided functions and logic do not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
