You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a square piece of paper with a side length equal to 1 unit. In one
operation, you fold each corner of the square to the center of the paper, thus
forming another square with a side length equal to \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} units.
By taking this square as a new square, you do the operation again and repeat
this process a total of N times.

Performing operations for N = 2 .

After performing the set of operations, you open the paper with the same side
up you started with and see some crease lines on it. Every crease line is one
of two types: a mountain or a valley. A mountain is when the paper folds
outward, and a valley is when the paper folds inward.

You calculate the sum of the length of all mountain crease lines on the paper
and call it M . Similarly, you calculate for valley crease lines and call it V
. You want to find the value of \dfrac{M}{V} .

It can be proved that this value can be represented in the form of A +
B\sqrt{2} , where A and B are rational numbers. Let this B be represented as
an irreducible fraction \dfrac{p}{q} , your task is to print p*inv(q) modulo
999\,999\,893 (note the unusual modulo), where inv(q) is the [modular
inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9 ),
the number of operations you perform on the square paper.

Output

For each test case, print on a new line the required answer.

Example

Note

The blue lines in the given figures represent mountain crease lines, and the
green lines represent valley crease lines.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

MOD = 999999893
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
results = []
for i in range(1, t + 1):
    N = int(data[i])
    results.append(func_2(N))
for result in results:
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer, and p is a prime number (in this case, p is 999999893, as specified in the problem statement).
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)
    #The program returns the result of \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `a` and a prime number `p` (specifically 999999893). It computes and returns the result of \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\) using modular exponentiation. This computation is performed efficiently using the `pow` function with three arguments: the base `a`, the exponent `p - 2`, and the modulus `p`. The function does not handle any edge cases beyond ensuring that the input `a` is a positive integer and `p` is the specific prime number 999999893. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has returned the computed value \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer such that 1 <= N <= 10^9.
def func_2(N):
    if (N == 1) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        if (N == 2) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            return 714285638
            #The program returns 714285638
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N` within the specified range. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond returning one of these three values based on the value of `N`.
