Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually calculate the required value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) for the given problem. Instead, it seems to handle only three specific cases (N=1, N=2, and N>2) and returns hardcoded values. However, the problem requires a more general solution to compute the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) for any \(N\) and express it in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\).

To properly verify the correctness, we would need a function that computes the number of mountain and valley crease lines for any \(N\) and calculates the required ratio. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not contribute to solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
