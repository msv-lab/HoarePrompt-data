You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a square piece of paper with a side length equal to 1 unit. In one
operation, you fold each corner of the square to the center of the paper, thus
forming another square with a side length equal to \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} units.
By taking this square as a new square, you do the operation again and repeat
this process a total of N times.

Performing operations for N = 2 .

After performing the set of operations, you open the paper with the same side
up you started with and see some crease lines on it. Every crease line is one
of two types: a mountain or a valley. A mountain is when the paper folds
outward, and a valley is when the paper folds inward.

You calculate the sum of the length of all mountain crease lines on the paper
and call it M . Similarly, you calculate for valley crease lines and call it V
. You want to find the value of \dfrac{M}{V} .

It can be proved that this value can be represented in the form of A +
B\sqrt{2} , where A and B are rational numbers. Let this B be represented as
an irreducible fraction \dfrac{p}{q} , your task is to print p*inv(q) modulo
999\,999\,893 (note the unusual modulo), where inv(q) is the [modular
inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) of q .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer N (1 \leq N \leq 10^9 ),
the number of operations you perform on the square paper.

Output

For each test case, print on a new line the required answer.

The blue lines in the given figures represent mountain crease lines, and the
green lines represent valley crease lines.

- Program:
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, p):
    return pow(a, p - 2, p)

#Function 2:
def func_2(N):
    if N == 1:
        return 0
    elif N == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        return 714285638



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `N` within the range 1 to \(10^9\). It returns 0 if `N` is 1, 1 if `N` is 2, and 714285638 for any other value of `N` within the specified range. There are no additional actions or side effects beyond returning one of these three values based on the value of `N`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually calculate the required value of \(\frac{M}{V}\) for the given problem. Instead, it seems to handle only three specific cases (N=1, N=2, and N>2) and returns hardcoded values. However, the problem requires a more general solution to compute the ratio \(\frac{M}{V}\) for any \(N\) and express it in the form \(A + B\sqrt{2}\).

To properly verify the correctness, we would need a function that computes the number of mountain and valley crease lines for any \(N\) and calculates the required ratio. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not contribute to solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is hence incorrect.
