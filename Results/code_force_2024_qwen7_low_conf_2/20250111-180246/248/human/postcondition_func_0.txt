The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `a` and a prime number `p` (specifically 999999893). It computes and returns the result of \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\) using modular exponentiation. This computation is performed efficiently using the `pow` function with three arguments: the base `a`, the exponent `p - 2`, and the modulus `p`. The function does not handle any edge cases beyond ensuring that the input `a` is a positive integer and `p` is the specific prime number 999999893. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the program has returned the computed value \(a^{999999891} \mod 999999893\).
