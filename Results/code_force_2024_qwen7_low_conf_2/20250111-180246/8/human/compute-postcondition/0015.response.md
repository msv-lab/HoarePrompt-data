The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but in this case, there is no loop or conditional statement that would be exited by this `break`. The values of the variables `z`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the `p` variable must still be 0 as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` must be 0**
