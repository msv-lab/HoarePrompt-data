`p` is incremented by 1. The value of `z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is initially at least 1, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `p + 2`. The new value of `p` is `p + 1`.

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is `p + 1`, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `p + 2`.**
