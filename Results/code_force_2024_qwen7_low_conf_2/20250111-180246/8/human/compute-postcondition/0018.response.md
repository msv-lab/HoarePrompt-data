Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by the expression:
   ```
   j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0
   ```

2. **Current States:**
   - `z` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - `p` is 1

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition with Current Values:**
   - Substituting the current values into the loop condition:
     ```
     0 + 1 + 1 < n and 1 - 1 - 1 >= 0
     ```
   - Simplifying this:
     ```
     2 < n and -1 >= 0
     ```
   - The second part of the condition, `-1 >= 0`, is false. Therefore, the entire condition is false.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   Since the loop condition is currently false, we need to adjust the states such that the loop condition becomes true in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust `j` and `p`:**
   - To satisfy `j + p + 1 < n`, `j` and `p` need to be adjusted. Let's assume `n` is a known positive integer.
   - For simplicity, let's assume `n` is some value greater than 2 (since `j + p + 1 < n` and both `j` and `p` are currently 0 and 1 respectively).

6. **Possible Adjustments:**
   - Increase `j` to 0 and increase `p` to 0 to make `j + p + 1 = 1 < n`.
   - Alternatively, decrease `i` to 0 to make `i - p - 1 = -2 >= 0` false, but this would make the entire condition false since the second part remains false.

7. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `j` to 0 and `p` to 0.
   - The value of `i` remains 1 as it doesn't affect the first part of the condition directly when `p` is 0.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:

State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 0**
