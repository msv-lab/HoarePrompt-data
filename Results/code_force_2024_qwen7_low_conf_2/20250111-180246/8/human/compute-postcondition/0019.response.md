The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `z`, `i`, `j`, and `p`. It only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 0**
