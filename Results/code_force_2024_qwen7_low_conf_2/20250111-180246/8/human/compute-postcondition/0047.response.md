**Postcondition:** `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j` (up to the point where the loop breaks), `r` is either `j + p` if the condition `j + p > r` is true, or remains unchanged otherwise, `res` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p`.
