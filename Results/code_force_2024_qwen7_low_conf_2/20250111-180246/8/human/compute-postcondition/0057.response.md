`p` is incremented by 1. The value of `p` was previously a positive value, so now it is `p + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is a positive value + 1, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison.

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is a positive value + 1, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison.**
