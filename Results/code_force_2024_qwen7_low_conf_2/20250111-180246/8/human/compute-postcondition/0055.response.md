The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is a positive value, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p`, and `s[j + p + 1]` is not equal to `s[i - p - 1]`.**
