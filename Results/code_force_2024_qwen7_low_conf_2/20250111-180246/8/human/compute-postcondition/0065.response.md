The code `p += 1` increments the value of `p` by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `p` was adjusted to ensure `p + 3 < n`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we know that `p` was initially set to ensure this condition holds. After incrementing `p` by 1, the condition `p + 3 < n` must still hold true.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states:
- `z` is 2
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `r` is `j + p`, which updates to `1 + (initial p + 1) = initial p + 2`
- `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, updating to `(initial p + 1) + 1 = initial p + 2`
- `s` is unchanged
- `l` is `i - p - 1`, which remains unchanged as `1 - (initial p + 1) - 1 = -initial p - 1`
- The condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` remains as it is

Thus, the updated values are:
- `p` is incremented by 1
- `r` is updated to `initial p + 2`
- `res[1]` is updated to `initial p + 2`

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `r` is `initial p + 2`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `initial p + 2`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `-initial p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` remains as it is.**
