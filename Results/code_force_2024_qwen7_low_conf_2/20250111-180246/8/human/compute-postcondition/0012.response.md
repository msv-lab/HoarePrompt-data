Postcondition: ***`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 0 if `i` is greater than or equal to `r` else `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])`. If the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is true, then the function continues execution from the next statement after the if block. Since there is no else part, the value of `p` remains as determined by the initial condition and no other changes occur to `z`, `i`, `j`, or `p`.***
