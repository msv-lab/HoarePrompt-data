Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is the maximum value it reached before the loop broke or completed its iterations, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is true if the loop broke early or false if the loop completed its iterations.**
