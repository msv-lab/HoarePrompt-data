`l` is assigned the value `i - p`, which is `1 - 1 = 0`. Similarly, `r` is assigned the value `j + p`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`. The values of `z`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1.

Output State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is 1**
