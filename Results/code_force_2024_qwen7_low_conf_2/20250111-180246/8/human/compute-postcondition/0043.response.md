The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The conditions and the values of `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged since the code only modifies `p`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `i` satisfies \( i - p - 2 \geq 0 \), and `j` satisfies \( j + p + 2 < n \); `p` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` satisfies \( i - (p + 1) - 2 \geq 0 \), and `j` satisfies \( j + (p + 1) + 2 < n \); `p` is increased by 1.**
