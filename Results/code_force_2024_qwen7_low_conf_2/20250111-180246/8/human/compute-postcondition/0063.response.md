The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, the only impact is that the execution will exit the current context (if there was one), but the values of the variables will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` must be adjusted to ensure `p + 3 < n`, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison.**
