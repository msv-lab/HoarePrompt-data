Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information
- `z` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0
- `p` is 2
- `r` is 0 if `r > 1` else the minimum of `r - 1` and `res[2 * (l + r) - 1]`
- `res` is `[1]`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
```
while j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0:
```

### Analysis of the Loop Condition
1. **Condition 1:** `j + p + 1 < n`
   - Currently, `j` is 0 and `p` is 2, so `j + p + 1 = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `3 < n` must hold true.
   
2. **Condition 2:** `i - p - 1 >= 0`
   - Currently, `i` is 1 and `p` is 2, so `i - p - 1 = 1 - 2 - 1 = -2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `-2 >= 0` must hold true, which is false.

Since the second condition is false (`i - p - 1 >= 0`), the loop will not execute another time regardless of the value of `n`.

### Conclusion
Since the second condition `i - p - 1 >= 0` is already false, no adjustments are needed for the loop to proceed. The only way the loop could have continued is if the first condition `j + p + 1 < n` was met, but even then, the second condition would still prevent it from continuing.

### Final Answer
No states need to be adjusted because the loop cannot execute another time based on the given conditions.

State: **None of the states need to be adjusted**
