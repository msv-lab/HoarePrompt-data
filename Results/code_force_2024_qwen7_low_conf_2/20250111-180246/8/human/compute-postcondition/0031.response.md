Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the current state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Condition:
```python
while j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current States:
- `z` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 0
- `p` is 0 if `r > 1` else the minimum of `r - 1` and `res[2 * (l + r) - 1]`
- `res` is [1]

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j + p + 1 < n` and `i - p - 1 >= 0`.
   - For the first iteration, we need to check both conditions.

2. **First Condition**: `j + p + 1 < n`
   - `j` is currently 0.
   - `p` is currently 0 (since no information about `r` and `res` suggests otherwise).
   - Therefore, `j + p + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - This condition will only fail if `n` is 1 or less. However, since we want to ensure the loop executes at least once, we assume `n` is greater than 1.
   - No adjustment needed for this part.

3. **Second Condition**: `i - p - 1 >= 0`
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `p` is currently 0.
   - Therefore, `i - p - 1 = 1 - 0 - 1 = 0`.
   - This condition will only fail if `i - p - 1` is negative. Since `i - p - 1` is 0, this condition is already met.
   - No adjustment needed for this part.

### Conclusion:
Both conditions are already satisfied with the current values of `j`, `i`, and `p`. There is no need to adjust any of these states to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

### Final Answer:
State: **`z` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 0 if `r > 1` else the minimum of `r - 1` and `res[2 * (l + r) - 1]`, `res` is [1]**
