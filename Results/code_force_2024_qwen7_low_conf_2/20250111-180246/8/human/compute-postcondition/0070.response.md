The code `res[z] = p` assigns the value of `p` to `res[z]`. Given that `z` is 2, this means `res[2]` is now set to `p`. The value of `p` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was determined by the condition in the if statement. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `z` is 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `p` is the maximum value it reached before the loop broke or completed its iterations; `r` is `1 + p`; `res[1]` is equal to `p`; `s` is unchanged; `l` is `1 - p`; `res[2]` is equal to `p`.

Output State: **`z` is 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `p` is the maximum value it reached before the loop broke or completed its iterations; `r` is `1 + p`; `res[1]` is equal to `p`; `s` is unchanged; `l` is `1 - p`; `res[2]` is equal to `p`.**
