Postcondition: ***`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` must be at least 1, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `p + 2`. If `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described above when the condition is true.***
