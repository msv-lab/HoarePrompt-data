The value of `p` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`z`, `i`, `j`, and `p`) are determined by the initial conditions, and none of them are affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the updated value of `p` is the initial value plus 1.

Output State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])` + 1.**
