`i` is assigned the value `(z + 1) // 2`. Given that `z` is 1, the value of `i` becomes `(1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `2 // 2`, resulting in `i` being equal to `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `z` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 1, `res` is [1].

Output State: **`z` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 1, `res` is [1]**
