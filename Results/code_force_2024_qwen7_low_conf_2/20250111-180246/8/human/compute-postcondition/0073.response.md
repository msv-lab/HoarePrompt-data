The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. Here, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.

The function has two possible return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns an empty list.
- Case_2: `res` is a list of 2*n-1 elements where each element `res[z]` represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j` (where `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`), and `p` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `s` and return either an empty list or a list containing the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at specific indices.
