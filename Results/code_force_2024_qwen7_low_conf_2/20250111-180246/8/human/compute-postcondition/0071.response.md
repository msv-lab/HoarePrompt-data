Output State: **`z` is `2 * n - 1`, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n - 1`, `p` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`, `r` is `n - 1`, `res` is a list of `2 * n - 1` elements where each element `res[z]` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j` (where `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`), `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `z = 0` to `z = 2 * n - 2`, and finally when `z = 2 * n - 1`. This means that the loop iterates `2 * n - 1` times in total.
- At the end of the loop, `z` will be `2 * n - 1`.
- The variables `i` and `j` are calculated based on the value of `z`. Specifically, `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`.
- The variable `p` stores the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`.
- The variable `r` is updated to the right boundary of the current palindromic substring when it is longer than the previous one.
- The list `res` is filled with the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings for each center `i` and `j`.

In the final state, the loop has processed all possible centers and filled the `res` list with the required lengths. The values of `s`, `l`, and `r` are updated accordingly.
