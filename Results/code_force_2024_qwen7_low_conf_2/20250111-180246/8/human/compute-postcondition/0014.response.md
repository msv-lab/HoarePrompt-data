Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is:
   ```
   while j + p + 1 < n and i - p - 1 >= 0:
   ```

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `z` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0
   - `p` is `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])` + 1

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   - The first part of the condition is `j + p + 1 < n`.
     - This means `j + p + 1` should be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - The second part of the condition is `i - p - 1 >= 0`.
     - This means `i - p - 1` should be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Check the Current Values:**
   - `j` is 0
   - `p` is `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r) - z])` + 1. Since `z` is 0, this simplifies to `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r)])` + 1.

5. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For `j + p + 1 < n` to be true in the next iteration, `j + p + 1` must be less than `n`. Given that `j` is 0, this simplifies to `p + 1 < n`.
   - For `i - p - 1 >= 0` to be true in the next iteration, `i - p - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `i` is 1, this simplifies to `1 - p - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `-p >= 0` or `p <= 0`.

6. **Adjust the State:**
   - To ensure `p + 1 < n` in the next iteration, `p` must be such that `p + 1 < n`. Since `p` is already defined as `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r)])` + 1, we need to ensure that `p + 1 < n`.
   - To ensure `1 - p - 1 >= 0` in the next iteration, `p` must be 0 because `p` is already defined as `min(r - i, res[2 * (l + r)])` + 1 and `i` is 1, making `p` positive.

7. **Final Adjustments:**
   - `p` must be 0 for the second condition to hold.
   - Therefore, `p` must be set to 0.

8. **Final State:**
   - `z` remains 0.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` remains 0.
   - `p` must be 0.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` must be 0**.
