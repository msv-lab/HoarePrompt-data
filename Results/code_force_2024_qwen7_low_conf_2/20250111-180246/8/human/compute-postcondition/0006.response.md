The value of `z` is initially 0 and it must be less than `2 * n - 1`. The code sets `i` to `(z + 1) // 2`. Since `z` is 0, `(z + 1) // 2` evaluates to `1 // 2`, which is 0. Therefore, `i` is assigned the value 0. The conditions and constraints on `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is 0, `i` is 0, and `z` must be less than `2 * n - 1`.**
