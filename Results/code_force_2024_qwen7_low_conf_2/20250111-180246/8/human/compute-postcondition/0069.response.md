Postcondition: ***`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is the maximum value it reached before the loop broke or completed its iterations, `r` is `1 + p`, `res[1]` is equal to `p`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `1 - p`. If `j + p > r`, then `r` is set to `j + p`. Otherwise, the values remain as they were before the if statement.***
