The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated in the provided code snippet, the variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` must be at least 1, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` is either true or false depending on the comparison. Additionally, `n` must be greater than `p + 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
