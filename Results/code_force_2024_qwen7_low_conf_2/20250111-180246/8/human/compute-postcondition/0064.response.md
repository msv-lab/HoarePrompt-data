Postcondition: ***`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` must be adjusted to ensure `p + 3 < n`, `r` is `j + p`, `res` is such that `res[1]` is equal to `p + 1`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p - 1`, and the condition `s[j + p + 1] != s[i - p - 1]` remains as it is, being either true or false depending on the comparison.***
