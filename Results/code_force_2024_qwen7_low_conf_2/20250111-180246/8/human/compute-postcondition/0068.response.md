The code `l, r = i - p, j + p` updates the values of `l` and `r`. Given the initial state:

- `z` is 2
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
- `p` is the maximum value it reached before the loop broke or completed its iterations
- `r` is `j + p`
- `res[1]` is equal to `p`
- `s` is unchanged
- `l` is `i - p - 1`
- the current value of `j + p` is greater than `r`

After running the code, the new values are:

- `l` is updated to `i - p`
- `r` is updated to `j + p`

Since the initial values of `i`, `j`, and `p` are known, we can calculate the new values of `l` and `r`:

- `l` = `i - p` = `1 - p`
- `r` = `j + p` = `1 + p`

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`z` is 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `p` is the maximum value it reached before the loop broke or completed its iterations, `r` is `1 + p`, `res[1]` is equal to `p`, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `1 - p`**
