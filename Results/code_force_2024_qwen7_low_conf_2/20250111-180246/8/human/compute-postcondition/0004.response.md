The code assigns the value `-1` to both `l` and `r`. The initial values of `n`, `s`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length > 0; `res` is a list of `2 * n - 1` elements, all set to 0; `l` is -1; `r` is -1.**
