The code assigns the value of `i - p` to `l` and the value of `j + p` to `r`. The values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `r`, `res`, `s`, and `z` remain unchanged.

- Initially, `j + p` is greater than `r`.
- After the assignment, `l` is updated to `i - p` and `r` is updated to `j + p`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`z` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j` (up to the point where the loop breaks), `r` is `j + p`, `res` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `l` is `i - p`**.
