The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block but does not affect the values of variables outside of that block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block that the `break` statement is exiting, the values of the variables `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that \( i - p - 2 \geq 0 \) and \( j + p + 2 < n \) is still valid.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` satisfies \( i - p - 2 \geq 0 \), and `j` satisfies \( j + p + 2 < n \)**
