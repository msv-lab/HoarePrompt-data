`p` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `p` changes to 2, while `z`, `i`, `j`, `r`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`z` is 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `p` is 2, `r` is 0 if `r > 1` else the minimum of `r - 1` and `res[2 * (l + r) - 1]`, `res` is [1]**
