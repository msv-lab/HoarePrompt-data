You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: A string t is said to be k -good if there exists at least one
substring^\dagger of length k which is not a palindrome^\ddagger . Let f(t)
denote the sum of all values of k such that the string t is k -good.

You are given a string s of length n . You will have to answer q of the
following queries:

  * Given l and r (l < r ), find the value of f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) . 

^\dagger A substring of a string z is a contiguous segment of characters from
z . For example, "\mathtt{defor} ", "\mathtt{code} " and "\mathtt{o} " are all
substrings of "\mathtt{codeforces} " while "\mathtt{codes} " and "\mathtt{aaa}
" are not.

^\ddagger A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.
For example, the strings "\texttt{z} ", "\texttt{aa} " and "\texttt{tacocat} "
are palindromes while "\texttt{codeforces} " and "\texttt{ab} " are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) â€” the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ), the size of the string and the number
of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string s . It is guaranteed the
string s only contains lowercase English characters.

The next q lines each contain two integers, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ).

It is guaranteed the sum of n and the sum of q both do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each query, output f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) .

Note

In the first query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaab} .
\mathtt{aaab} , \mathtt{aab} and \mathtt{ab} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 4 , 3 and 2 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good, 3 -good and 4 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaab}) = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 .

In the second query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaa} . There
are no non-palindromic substrings. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaa}) = 0 .

In the first query of the second test case, the string is \mathtt{abc} .
\mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{bc} and \mathtt{abc} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 2 , 2 and 3 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good and 3 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{abc}) = 2 + 3 = 5 . Note that even
though there are 2 non-palindromic substrings of length 2 , we count it only
once.
