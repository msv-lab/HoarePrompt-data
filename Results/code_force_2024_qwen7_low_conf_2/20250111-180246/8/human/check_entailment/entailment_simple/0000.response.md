Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program fails to accurately compute the function \( f(t) \) and handle the queries as specified. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Computation of \( f(t) \)**:
   - The problem requires calculating \( f(t) \), which is the sum of all values of \( k \) such that the string \( t \) is \( k \)-good.
   - The program calculates the longest palindromic substring centered around each position using the Manacher's algorithm (`func_1` function). However, it does not use this information correctly to determine the \( k \)-good values for the substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r \).

2. **Handling Queries**:
   - The program computes the value of \( f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) \) for each query but does not correctly determine whether a substring of length \( k \) is non-palindromic.
   - The logic to determine if a substring is \( k \)-good is missing. Specifically, the program should check if there exists any substring of length \( k \) that is not a palindrome, but the current implementation does not perform this check.

3. **Key Logic Missing**:
   - The core logic to check if a substring is \( k \)-good is not present. The program should iterate over possible lengths \( k \) and check if there exists a non-palindromic substring of that length within the queried substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r \).
   - Instead, the program uses precomputed palindromic lengths (`p1` and `p2`) to make assumptions about the presence of non-palindromic substrings, which is not sufficient for determining \( k \)-good values.

4. **Incorrect Assumptions**:
   - The program assumes that if a substring of length \( k \) ends at position \( r \) and starts at position \( l \), it can directly compute the result based on these positions without checking the actual substring content. This assumption is flawed because it does not account for the non-palindromic nature of the substring.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the solution, you would need to:
1. Precompute the longest palindromic substring lengths for each center position.
2. For each query, iterate over possible lengths \( k \) and check if there exists a non-palindromic substring of length \( k \) within the queried substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r \).
3. Sum up the valid \( k \) values to get the result for each query.

The provided program does not achieve this, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
