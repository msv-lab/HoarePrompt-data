You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A string t is said to be k -good if there exists at least one
substring^\dagger of length k which is not a palindrome^\ddagger . Let f(t)
denote the sum of all values of k such that the string t is k -good.

You are given a string s of length n . You will have to answer q of the
following queries:

  * Given l and r (l < r ), find the value of f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) . 

^\dagger A substring of a string z is a contiguous segment of characters from
z . For example, "\mathtt{defor} ", "\mathtt{code} " and "\mathtt{o} " are all
substrings of "\mathtt{codeforces} " while "\mathtt{codes} " and "\mathtt{aaa}
" are not.

^\ddagger A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.
For example, the strings "\texttt{z} ", "\texttt{aa} " and "\texttt{tacocat} "
are palindromes while "\texttt{codeforces} " and "\texttt{ab} " are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) â€” the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ), the size of the string and the number
of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string s . It is guaranteed the
string s only contains lowercase English characters.

The next q lines each contain two integers, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ).

It is guaranteed the sum of n and the sum of q both do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each query, output f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) .

Note

In the first query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaab} .
\mathtt{aaab} , \mathtt{aab} and \mathtt{ab} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 4 , 3 and 2 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good, 3 -good and 4 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaab}) = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 .

In the second query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaa} . There
are no non-palindromic substrings. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaa}) = 0 .

In the first query of the second test case, the string is \mathtt{abc} .
\mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{bc} and \mathtt{abc} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 2 , 2 and 3 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good and 3 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{abc}) = 2 + 3 = 5 . Note that even
though there are 2 non-palindromic substrings of length 2 , we count it only
once.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
