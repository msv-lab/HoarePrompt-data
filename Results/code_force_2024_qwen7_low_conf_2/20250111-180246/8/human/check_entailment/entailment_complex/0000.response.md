### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at specific indices for the given string `s`.
   - The result is stored in a list `res` of length `2 * n - 1`, where each element `res[z]` represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j`, with `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`.
   - The function correctly handles the case when `n` is 0 by returning an empty list.

2. **Main Loop Analysis:**
   - The main loop iterates over the queries, extracting the substring `s_l ... s_r` and calculating `f(s_l ... s_r)` using the precomputed palindromic information.
   - The logic for computing `f(t)` is sound:
     - If the longest non-palindromic substring starting at index `l` extends beyond `r`, `f(t)` is 0.
     - If the longest non-palindromic substring starting at index `l` extends up to `r-1`, `f(t)` is calculated as the sum of all possible `k` values minus the length of the longest palindromic substring.
     - If neither condition is met, `f(t)` is computed as the sum of all possible `k` values minus 1.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case when `n` is 0.
   - The main loop correctly processes each query by leveraging the precomputed palindromic information.
   - The logic for determining the value of `f(t)` is sound and accounts for all possible scenarios.
