Reasoning: 
1. The main program logic correctly implements the required functionality:
   - It precomputes the boundaries of the longest palindromic substrings for each possible center using the `func_1` function.
   - It uses these precomputed values to efficiently determine whether a substring from `l` to `r` is k-good for various values of k.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at specific indices, ensuring that the precomputed values are accurate.
3. The program handles the edge case when the input string `s` is empty by returning an empty list from `func_1`.
4. The program processes each query efficiently by leveraging the precomputed values to determine the value of `f` for the substring `s[l:r+1]`.

Given the detailed execution summary and the analysis of the program's logic, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
