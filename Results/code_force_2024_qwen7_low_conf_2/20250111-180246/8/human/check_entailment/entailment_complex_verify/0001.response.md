### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The code uses a preprocessing step to build two arrays `p1` and `p2` which store the positions of the first mismatch from the start and the second mismatch from the start, respectively, for every possible starting position in the string.
   - It also includes a function `func_1` which computes a suffix array for the string, specifically to check if a substring can be extended as a palindrome.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the code calculates the length of the substring and checks conditions using the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2`.
   - Depending on the results, it calculates the value of \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).

3. **Validation**:
   - **Preprocessing (`p1` and `p2` Arrays)**:
     - The `p1` array helps identify the first non-palindromic suffix of any length.
     - The `p2` array does the same but for the second character mismatch.
   - **Query Handling**:
     - If `p1[l]` is greater than or equal to `r`, there are no non-palindromic substrings of any length within the queried substring, so \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = 0\).
     - If `p2[l]` is greater than or equal to `r-1`, it means all substrings up to length `r-l` are palindromes, and thus \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = \frac{(r-l)(r-l+1)}{2}\).
     - Otherwise, it uses the formula involving the sum of an arithmetic series and subtracts the non-palindromic substrings using the precomputed information.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function builds a suffix array which helps in determining the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring center. This is used to validate the correctness of the `p1` and `p2` arrays.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the substring length is small and directly checks for non-palindromic substrings without needing complex computations.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - The code correctly handles edge cases where `p1[l] >= r` and `p2[l] >= r - 1`, ensuring that the program outputs the correct values of \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).
  - The function `func_1` computes the necessary suffix array to support the `p1` and `p2` arrays, which are essential for the main logic.

- **Query Processing**:
  - The query processing logic is sound and follows the problem constraints accurately. It correctly identifies the lengths of non-palindromic substrings and uses them to calculate \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` correctly computes the suffix array, which is crucial for the `p1` and `p2` arrays. Each element `res[z]` in the returned list represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at specific indices `(i, j)`.

- **Overall Logic**:
  - The overall logic of the program is consistent with the problem statement and correctly implements the required functionality.

Given the detailed implementation and the validation steps, the provided code appears to correctly compute the required function \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\) based on the problem statement and the examples provided.
