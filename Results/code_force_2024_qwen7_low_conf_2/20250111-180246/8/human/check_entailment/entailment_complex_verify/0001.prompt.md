You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A string t is said to be k -good if there exists at least one
substring^\dagger of length k which is not a palindrome^\ddagger . Let f(t)
denote the sum of all values of k such that the string t is k -good.

You are given a string s of length n . You will have to answer q of the
following queries:

  * Given l and r (l < r ), find the value of f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) . 

^\dagger A substring of a string z is a contiguous segment of characters from
z . For example, "\mathtt{defor} ", "\mathtt{code} " and "\mathtt{o} " are all
substrings of "\mathtt{codeforces} " while "\mathtt{codes} " and "\mathtt{aaa}
" are not.

^\ddagger A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.
For example, the strings "\texttt{z} ", "\texttt{aa} " and "\texttt{tacocat} "
are palindromes while "\texttt{codeforces} " and "\texttt{ab} " are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ), the size of the string and the number
of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string s . It is guaranteed the
string s only contains lowercase English characters.

The next q lines each contain two integers, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ).

It is guaranteed the sum of n and the sum of q both do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each query, output f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) .

Note

In the first query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaab} .
\mathtt{aaab} , \mathtt{aab} and \mathtt{ab} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 4 , 3 and 2 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good, 3 -good and 4 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaab}) = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 .

In the second query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaa} . There
are no non-palindromic substrings. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaa}) = 0 .

In the first query of the second test case, the string is \mathtt{abc} .
\mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{bc} and \mathtt{abc} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 2 , 2 and 3 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good and 3 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{abc}) = 2 + 3 = 5 . Note that even
though there are 2 non-palindromic substrings of length 2 , we count it only
once.

    #`res' is a list of 2*n-1 elements where each element res[z] is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices i and j (where i = (z + 1) // 2 and j = z // 2), and p is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices i - p - 1 and j + p
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`) and `s` (a string consisting of lowercase English letters). The function computes the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at specific indices for the given string `s`.

After executing the function, the state of the program will be as follows:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
- Otherwise, the function returns a list `res` of length `2 * n - 1`, where each element `res[z]` (with `z` ranging from 0 to `2 * n - 2`) represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j`, where `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`. Additionally, for each `z`, `res[z]` is also the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`, where `p` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`.

Potential edge case: When `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. This ensures that the function handles the case where the input string `s` is empty correctly.

Missing functionality: The provided annotations and code do not explicitly mention handling cases where `s` contains only one character or is a single character repeated throughout. However, since the algorithm checks for palindromes centered at specific indices, it inherently covers these cases as well. Therefore, no additional missing functionality needs to be included in the summary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The code uses a preprocessing step to build two arrays `p1` and `p2` which store the positions of the first mismatch from the start and the second mismatch from the start, respectively, for every possible starting position in the string.
   - It also includes a function `func_1` which computes a suffix array for the string, specifically to check if a substring can be extended as a palindrome.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the code calculates the length of the substring and checks conditions using the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2`.
   - Depending on the results, it calculates the value of \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).

3. **Validation**:
   - **Preprocessing (`p1` and `p2` Arrays)**: 
     - The `p1` array helps identify the first non-palindromic suffix of any length.
     - The `p2` array does the same but for the second character mismatch.
   - **Query Handling**:
     - If `p1[l]` is greater than or equal to `r`, there are no non-palindromic substrings of any length within the queried substring, so \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = 0\).
     - If `p2[l]` is greater than or equal to `r-1`, it means all substrings up to length `r-l` are palindromes, and thus \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = \frac{(r-l)(r-l+1)}{2}\).
     - Otherwise, it uses the formula involving the sum of an arithmetic series and subtracts the non-palindromic substrings using the precomputed information.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function builds a suffix array which helps in determining the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring center. This is used to validate the correctness of the `p1` and `p2` arrays.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the substring length is small and directly checks for non-palindromic substrings without needing complex computations.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed implementation and the validation steps, the provided code appears to correctly compute the required function \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\) based on the problem statement and the examples provided.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
