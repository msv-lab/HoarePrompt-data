You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A string t is said to be k -good if there exists at least one
substring^\dagger of length k which is not a palindrome^\ddagger . Let f(t)
denote the sum of all values of k such that the string t is k -good.

You are given a string s of length n . You will have to answer q of the
following queries:

  * Given l and r (l < r ), find the value of f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) . 

^\dagger A substring of a string z is a contiguous segment of characters from
z . For example, "\mathtt{defor} ", "\mathtt{code} " and "\mathtt{o} " are all
substrings of "\mathtt{codeforces} " while "\mathtt{codes} " and "\mathtt{aaa}
" are not.

^\ddagger A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forwards.
For example, the strings "\texttt{z} ", "\texttt{aa} " and "\texttt{tacocat} "
are palindromes while "\texttt{codeforces} " and "\texttt{ab} " are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5, 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ), the size of the string and the number
of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string s . It is guaranteed the
string s only contains lowercase English characters.

The next q lines each contain two integers, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ).

It is guaranteed the sum of n and the sum of q both do not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each query, output f(s_ls_{l + 1}\ldots s_r) .

Note

In the first query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaab} .
\mathtt{aaab} , \mathtt{aab} and \mathtt{ab} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 4 , 3 and 2 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good, 3 -good and 4 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaab}) = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 .

In the second query of the first test case, the string is \mathtt{aaa} . There
are no non-palindromic substrings. Hence, f(\mathtt{aaa}) = 0 .

In the first query of the second test case, the string is \mathtt{abc} .
\mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{bc} and \mathtt{abc} are all substrings that are not
palindromes, and they have lengths 2 , 2 and 3 respectively. Thus, the string
is 2 -good and 3 -good. Hence, f(\mathtt{abc}) = 2 + 3 = 5 . Note that even
though there are 2 non-palindromic substrings of length 2 , we count it only
once.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`) and `s` (a string consisting of lowercase English letters). The function computes the lengths of the longest palindromic substrings centered at specific indices for the given string `s`.

After executing the function, the state of the program will be as follows:
- If `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
- Otherwise, the function returns a list `res` of length `2 * n - 1`, where each element `res[z]` (with `z` ranging from 0 to `2 * n - 2`) represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j`, where `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`. Additionally, for each `z`, `res[z]` is also the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`, where `p` is the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i - p - 1` and `j + p`.

Potential edge case: When `n` is 0, the function returns an empty list. This ensures that the function handles the case where the input string `s` is empty correctly.

Missing functionality: The provided annotations and code do not explicitly mention handling cases where `s` contains only one character or is a single character repeated throughout. However, since the algorithm checks for palindromes centered at specific indices, it inherently covers these cases as well. Therefore, no additional missing functionality needs to be included in the summary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the value of \( f(s_l \ldots s_r) \). Specifically, the program uses precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2` to determine the positions of the first and second non-matching characters from the left, but it does not accurately reflect whether a substring of length \( k \) is non-palindromic.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the string `s = "aba"`. For this string, the value of \( f(s) \) should be 1 because the substring `"aba"` itself is not a palindrome, and it has length 3. However, the program would incorrectly calculate \( f(s) \) as 0.

To illustrate this, let's run the program on the string `"aba"`:

- The program computes `p1` and `p2` correctly for `"aba"`, but it fails to properly determine the non-palindromic substrings.
- For the query `1 3` (which corresponds to the entire string `"aba"`), the program should output `1` but instead outputs `0`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, making it incorrect.
