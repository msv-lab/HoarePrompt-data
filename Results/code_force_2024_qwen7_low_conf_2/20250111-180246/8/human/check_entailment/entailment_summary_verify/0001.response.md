### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The code preprocesses the string to build two arrays `p1` and `p2` which store the positions of the first mismatch from the start and the second mismatch from the start, respectively, for every possible starting position in the string.
   - The `func_1` function computes a suffix array to check if a substring can be extended as a palindrome.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the code calculates the length of the substring and checks conditions using the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2`.
   - Depending on the results, it calculates the value of \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).

3. **Validation**:
   - **Preprocessing (`p1` and `p2` Arrays)**:
     - The `p1` array helps identify the first non-palindromic suffix of any length.
     - The `p2` array does the same but for the second character mismatch.
   - **Query Handling**:
     - If `p1[l]` is greater than or equal to `r`, there are no non-palindromic substrings of any length within the queried substring, so \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = 0\).
     - If `p2[l]` is greater than or equal to `r-1`, it means all substrings up to length `r-l` are palindromes, and thus \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = \frac{(r-l)(r-l+1)}{2}\).
     - Otherwise, it uses the formula involving the sum of an arithmetic series and subtracts the non-palindromic substrings using the precomputed information.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function builds a suffix array which helps in determining the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring center. This is used to validate the correctness of the `p1` and `p2` arrays.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the substring length is small and directly checks for non-palindromic substrings without needing complex computations.

### Analysis Based on Function Summaries:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` computes a suffix array which helps in determining the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring center. This is crucial for verifying the correctness of the `p1` and `p2` arrays.
  - The function ensures that the precomputed arrays are correct by computing the longest palindromic substrings centered at each index, ensuring that the logic used in `p1` and `p2` is accurate.

### Detailed Validation:

- **Preprocessing (`p1` and `p2` Arrays)**:
  - The `p1` array is correctly computed to store the positions of the first non-palindromic suffix for each starting position.
  - The `p2` array is similarly computed to store the positions of the second non-palindromic suffix for each starting position.
  - Both arrays are used correctly in the query processing phase to determine the value of \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).

- **Query Handling**:
  - The logic for calculating \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\) is correct. It leverages the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2` to efficiently determine the value of \(f\) for each query.
  - The edge cases where `p1[l] >= r` or `p2[l] >= r-1` are handled correctly, ensuring that the function returns the appropriate result.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when the substring length is small or when the entire substring is a palindrome.
