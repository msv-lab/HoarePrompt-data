### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The code uses a preprocessing step to build two arrays `p1` and `p2` which store the positions of the first mismatch from the start and the second mismatch from the start, respectively, for every possible starting position in the string.
   - It also includes a function `func_1` which computes a suffix array for the string, specifically to check if a substring can be extended as a palindrome.

2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query, the code calculates the length of the substring and checks conditions using the precomputed arrays `p1` and `p2`.
   - Depending on the results, it calculates the value of \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\).

3. **Validation**:
   - **Preprocessing (`p1` and `p2` Arrays)**:
     - The `p1` array helps identify the first non-palindromic suffix of any length.
     - The `p2` array does the same but for the second character mismatch.
   - **Query Handling**:
     - If `p1[l]` is greater than or equal to `r`, there are no non-palindromic substrings of any length within the queried substring, so \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = 0\).
     - If `p2[l]` is greater than or equal to `r-1`, it means all substrings up to length `r-l` are palindromes, and thus \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r) = \frac{(r-l)(r-l+1)}{2}\).
     - Otherwise, it uses the formula involving the sum of an arithmetic series and subtracts the non-palindromic substrings using the precomputed information.
   - **Function `func_1`**:
     - This function builds a suffix array which helps in determining the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring center. This is used to validate the correctness of the `p1` and `p2` arrays.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The code handles edge cases where the substring length is small and directly checks for non-palindromic substrings without needing complex computations.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes a suffix array which helps in determining the longest palindromic prefix and suffix for each substring center. This is used to validate the correctness of the `p1` and `p2` arrays.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that for each position `z`, the value `res[z]` represents the length of the longest palindromic substring centered at indices `i` and `j` (where `i = (z + 1) // 2` and `j = z // 2`).

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The `p1` and `p2` arrays are correctly built to identify the first and second mismatches from the start.
   - The logic in the main part of the code accurately handles the different cases for the queries.
   - The `func_1` function correctly builds the suffix array, ensuring that the `p1` and `p2` arrays are valid.

Based on the detailed analysis and the provided annotations, the code appears to correctly compute the required function \(f(s_l s_{l+1} \ldots s_r)\) based on the problem statement and the examples provided.
