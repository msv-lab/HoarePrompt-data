#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
def func_1(n, v, p):
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
        
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i
        elif strength == max_strength:
            min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_strength` is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n`, and `min_mushrooms` is the smallest index `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.
    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #The program returns max_strength which is the maximum value of i * v_sorted[i - 1] for i from 1 to n, and min_mushrooms which is the smallest index i such that i * v_sorted[i - 1] equals max_strength
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `v`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms.
- `v` is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom.
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The function first sorts the list `v` in non-decreasing order. It then iterates through the sorted list to calculate the product of each index `i` and the corresponding element `v_sorted[i - 1]`. During this iteration, it keeps track of the maximum strength (`max_strength`) and the minimum index (`min_mushrooms`) that achieves this maximum strength.

After the loop, the function returns two values:
- `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest index `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the list `v` is empty or `n` is zero, the function will still execute the loop but will result in `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` being undefined (as the loop won't run).

Missing functionality:
- The parameter `p` is not used in the function, so it can be considered redundant for the purpose of calculating `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms`.
