The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `v`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms.
- `v` is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom.
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The function first sorts the list `v` in non-decreasing order. It then iterates through the sorted list to calculate the product of each index `i` and the corresponding element `v_sorted[i - 1]`. During this iteration, it keeps track of the maximum strength (`max_strength`) and the minimum index (`min_mushrooms`) that achieves this maximum strength.

After the loop, the function returns two values:
- `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest index `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the list `v` is empty or `n` is zero, the function will still execute the loop but will result in `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` being undefined (as the loop won't run).

Missing functionality:
- The parameter `p` is not used in the function, so it can be considered redundant for the purpose of calculating `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms`.
