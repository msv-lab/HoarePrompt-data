The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state of `n` is a non-negative integer, after executing the code, `n` will still be a non-negative integer, but its specific value will depend on the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0; `n` is a non-negative integer and equals the input value; `v` is [1, 2, 3]; `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2`; the heap `h` is empty; `output` is the maximum possible value that satisfies the conditions in the loop; `output[0]` is printed; `output[1]` is printed.**
