`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `h` contains the single element `[3]`. After calling `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element `3` is removed, leaving `h` empty.

Output State: **`h` is an empty heap, `output[0]` is `4`, `output[1]` is `2`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `n` is even, `len(h)` is `0`, `l` is `1`.**
