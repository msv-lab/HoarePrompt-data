The code `l = len(h)` assigns the length of the heap `h` to the variable `l`. The length of `h` is calculated from the initial state, where `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]` and `output[1]` is `len(h)`. Since `output[1]` directly gives us the length of `h`, the value of `l` is the same as `output[1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is the heap `h` excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]`, `output[1]` is the same as `l`, and `l` is `output[1]`.

Output State: **`h` is the heap `h` excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]`, `output[1]` is `output[1]`, and `l` is `output[1]`**.
