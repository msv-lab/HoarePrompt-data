Postcondition: **`h` is a heap containing `[3]`, `output[0]` is `4`, `output[1]` is `2`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `n` is even, `len(h)` is `1`, `l` is `1`. The first element of `v` is greater than the first element of `h`, i.e., `v[p[l - 1] - 1] > h[0]`**
