Output State: **`output` is `h[0] * l, l`; `h` does not contain its smallest element. If `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, then `h` now contains its new smallest element, which is `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, and the length of `h` becomes `l - 1`. Otherwise, `h` remains unchanged and the length of `h` remains as `l`.**
