The code `min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)` updates the value of `min_mushrooms` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 3 and `min_mushrooms` is 1, the new value of `min_mushrooms` will be 1 because 1 is less than 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, and `min_mushrooms` is 1.**
