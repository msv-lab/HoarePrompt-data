`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` was a heap containing the elements of `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for \( j \) ranging from 0 to `max_size - 1` except the smallest one, after removing the smallest element, the new state of `h` will exclude this smallest element. The values of `t`, `n`, `v`, `p`, `max_size`, `output[0]`, `output[1]`, and `output` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is the heap `h` excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]`, `output[1]` is `len(h)`, and `output` is unchanged.**
