Postcondition: **`h` is a heap containing the elements of `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for \( j \) ranging from 0 to `max_size - 1` except the smallest one, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]`, `output[1]` is `len(h)`, `output` is unchanged, the length of `h` is 1, and the current value of `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`**
