The code initializes `max_strength` to 0, which does not affect the values of `n`, `v`, `p`, or `v_sorted`. The output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms, `v` is a list of positive integers, `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, `v_sorted` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order, `max_strength` is 0**
