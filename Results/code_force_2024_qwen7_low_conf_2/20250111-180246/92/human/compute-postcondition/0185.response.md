The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p`. The parameter `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). `v` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\), and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given the provided cases, we need to determine the return value, but since no specific return conditions are mentioned other than the parameters, we can only state the parameters and their constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the parameters `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` as described.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\)), `v` (a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\)), and `p` (a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`).**
