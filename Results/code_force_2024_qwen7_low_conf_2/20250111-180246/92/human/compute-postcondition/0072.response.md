`h` is a heap that gets an additional element from `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` using `heapq.heappush`. Before the operation, `h` had an additional element `v[p[n - 1 - (j + 1)] - 1]`. After pushing the new element, the heap property will be maintained, but the exact values of the elements in the heap will change. The variables `v`, `p`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with elements including `v[p[n - 1 - (j + 1)] - 1]` and `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]`, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`**
