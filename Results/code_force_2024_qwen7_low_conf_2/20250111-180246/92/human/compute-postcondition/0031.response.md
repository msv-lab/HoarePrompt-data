Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, the heap `h` contains [1], `l` is 1, the output is (4, 2). If `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]` is true, the value of `h[0]` is 1. There is no else part provided, so the state of the program remains unchanged as per the if part.***
