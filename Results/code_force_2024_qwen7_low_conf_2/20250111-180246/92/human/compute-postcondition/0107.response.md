Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with the two smallest elements removed, plus possibly the element `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` depending on the if condition; `t`, `n`, `v`, `p`, `max_size`, and `l` remain unchanged; `output[0]` and `output[1]` are updated as follows: if `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `output[0]` is `h[0] * l` and `output[1]` is `l`; otherwise, `output[0]` and `output[1]` retain their previous values.***
