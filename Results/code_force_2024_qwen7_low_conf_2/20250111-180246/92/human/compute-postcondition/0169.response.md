Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap. If `h` has exactly one element, `output[0]` is `3` and `output[1]` is `1`. Otherwise, `h` is a heap with the smallest element removed plus the element `1` or `2` from `v`. `output[0]` is either `h[0] * (len(h) - 1)` or `4`, and `output[1]` is either `len(h) - 1` or `2`. `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, and `n` is even.***
