The line `max_size = (n + 2) // 2` does not modify any existing variables but instead reassigns the value of `max_size`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the heap `h` remains empty. All other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is a non-negative integer and equals the input value, `v` is a list of integers from the user input, `p` is the same list as `v`, `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2`, the heap `h` is empty, `output` is the maximum possible value that satisfies the conditions in the loop, `output[0]` is printed, `output[1]` is printed, `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
