`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` is a heap, the smallest element is also the first element in the list when it is not sorted. After removing this element, the next smallest element in the heap will move to the root position to maintain the heap property.

Given the initial state, the first element of `h` is smaller than the element at index `p[l-1] - 1` in `v`. After removing the smallest element from `h`, the smallest element in `h` will be the new first element. The value of `output[0]` was initially `len(h) * h[0]`, and since `h[0]` is now the new smallest element, `output[0]` will be updated accordingly. 

Let's denote the smallest element of `h` before popping as `smallest_h`. After the operation, `smallest_h` is removed, and the new `h[0]` is the next smallest element. Thus, the new value of `output[0]` will be `len(h) * new_h[0]`.

Output State: **`h` is the heap excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * new_h[0]`, `output[1]` is `output[1]`, and `l` is `output[1]`. The first element of `h` is no longer smaller than the element at index `p[l-1] - 1` in `v`.**
