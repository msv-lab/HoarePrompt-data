The code `break` is used to exit the current loop or the most internal block it is inside. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values and simply indicates that the program would exit the most internal loop or block it was inside. Given that no loop or block is mentioned, it implies that the `break` statement does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, and the tuple `output` is (1, 1). No changes are made to the variables due to the `break` statement.**
