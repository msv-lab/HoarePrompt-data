Output State: **`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed plus the element `1` or `2` from `v`; `output[0]` is `h[0] * (l - 1)`, `output[1]` is `l - 1`; `max_size` is a positive integer; `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements; `t` is `t - max_size`; `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`; `j` is `max_size - 1`; `n` is even; `l` is `l - 1`.**
