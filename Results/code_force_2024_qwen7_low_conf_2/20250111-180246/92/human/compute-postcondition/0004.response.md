`strength` is assigned the value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `strength = 1 * v_sorted[0]`, which means `strength` is set to the value of `v_sorted[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`**
