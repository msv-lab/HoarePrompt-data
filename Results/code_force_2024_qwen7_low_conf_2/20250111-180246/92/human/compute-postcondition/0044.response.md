Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, and `l` is 0. If the smallest element from `h` is less than `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, the smallest element from `h` has been removed and returned, and `h` now contains the element 1. If the condition is not met, the smallest element from `h` remains unchanged.***
