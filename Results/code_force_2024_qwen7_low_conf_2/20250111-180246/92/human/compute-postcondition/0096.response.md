Postcondition: **`h` is a heap containing the elements of `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for \( j \) ranging from 0 to `max_size - 1` except the smallest one, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, and `output[0]` and `output[1]` are updated according to the following conditions: if `len(h) == 1`, then `output[0]` is `h[0]` and `output[1]` is `1` with the condition that `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`; otherwise, `output[0]` is `h[0] * len(h)` and `output[1]` is `len(h)` if `h[0] * len(h) < output[0]`, otherwise `output[0]` is `h[0] * (len(h) + 1)` and `output[1]` is `len(h) + 1`.**
