Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` is at least 1.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `v` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 3].
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `max_size` is \((n + 2) // 2\).
   - If `len(h) == 1`, then the tuple `output` is (1, 1) and no changes are made to other variables.
   - Otherwise, `l` is 0.
     - If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `output[0]` is 0.
     - Otherwise, the smallest element from `h` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since it's a `while True` loop, the loop will always execute at least one more time as long as the program logic doesn't terminate the loop.

Given these conditions, since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute one more time regardless of the current values of the variables. Therefore, we don't need to adjust any specific states to ensure the loop executes one more time.

**State:**
State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, and the loop will always execute one more time.**
