The code `print(output[0], output[1])` simply prints the first and second elements of the `output` list. No variables are assigned new values or changed by this line of code. Therefore, the only information that changes is the output itself, which consists of the first and second elements of the `output` list.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2`, the heap `h` is empty, `output` is the maximum possible value that satisfies the conditions in the loop, `output[0]` is printed, and `output[1]` is printed.**
