The `heapq.heappop(h)` function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial state, the smallest element in the heap `h` is removed, and this operation does not affect the other variables such as `t`, `n`, `v`, `p`, `max_size`, `output[0]`, and `output[1]`.

Output State: **`h` is the heap with the smallest element removed, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, and `output[0]` and `output[1]` are updated according to the conditions mentioned above.**
