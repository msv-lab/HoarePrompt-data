Postcondition: ***`h` is the heap excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, and `max_size` is unchanged. If `h[0] * l < output[0]`, the state of the program remains as in the if part. Otherwise, `h` contains the elements of the original heap plus `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, maintaining the heap property.***
