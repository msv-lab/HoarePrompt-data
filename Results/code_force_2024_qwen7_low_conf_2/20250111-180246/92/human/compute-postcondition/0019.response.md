Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, and `min_mushrooms` is 1.***

This postcondition reflects the initial state of the variables as described in the precondition, since neither the if nor the else part of the conditional statement introduces any new changes to these variables.
