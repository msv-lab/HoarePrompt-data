`max_strength` is assigned the value of `strength`. Since `strength` is equal to `v_sorted[0]` and is currently greater than `max_strength`, after this assignment, `max_strength` will take the value of `v_sorted[0]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `strength` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, and `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`**
