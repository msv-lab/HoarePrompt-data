Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, and `min_mushrooms` is 1. If `strength` is greater than `max_strength`, `min_mushrooms` is set to 3; otherwise, `min_mushrooms` remains 1. Given the else part does not change the `min_mushrooms` from its original value, the overall postcondition is that `min_mushrooms` is 1.***
