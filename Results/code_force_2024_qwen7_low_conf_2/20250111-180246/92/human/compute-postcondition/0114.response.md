The code `l = len(h)` calculates the length of the list `h` and assigns it to the variable `l`. The initial state mentions that `h` does not contain its smallest element, but the code itself does not affect this property of `h`. Therefore, the length of `h` is stored in `l`, and `h` retains its original property.

Output State: **`h` does not contain its smallest element, `l` is the length of `h`**
