The `break` statement does not affect the values of `h` and `output`. It only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code, the values of `h` and `output` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`h` is a list, `output` is a tuple. If `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output` is a tuple containing `h[0]` and `1`, and `h` remains unchanged.**
