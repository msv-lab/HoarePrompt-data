The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `min_mushrooms`. The value of `i` does not change, so `i` remains 3. The other variables (`n`, `strength`, and `max_strength`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, `min_mushrooms` is 3, `max_strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`**
