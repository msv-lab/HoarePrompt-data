`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. The state of `h` changes, but without knowing the initial contents of `h`, we cannot specify the exact elements left in the heap. However, we know that the smallest element has been removed.

Output State: **`h` does not contain its smallest element, the state of `h` is updated accordingly.**
