Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap and `output` is a tuple. If `len(h) == 1`, then `output` is set to `(h[0] * (l-1), l-1)`. If `len(h) != 1`, then `output` is updated to (`h[0]`, 1) if `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`; otherwise, `output` is updated to `(h[0] * l, l)` with the heap potentially including the value `v[p[l-1]-1]` as the new second smallest element, and `l` being decremented by 1.***
