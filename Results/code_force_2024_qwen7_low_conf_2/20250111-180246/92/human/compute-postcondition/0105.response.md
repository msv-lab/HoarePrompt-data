Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with the two smallest elements removed, plus possibly the element `v[p[l - 1] - 1]` depending on the if condition. `t`, `n`, `v`, `p`, `max_size`, and `l` remain unchanged. `l` is the length of the heap `h`. `output[0]` and `output[1]` are updated according to the conditions mentioned above.***
