Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \(t\) (number of test cases), a positive integer \(n\) (length of the list \(v\)), a list \(v\) of \(n\) positive integers, and a permutation \(p\) of numbers from 1 to \(n\). For each test case, it constructs a min-heap \(h\) containing the largest half of the elements from \(v\) indexed by the reverse permutation \(p\). It then iteratively updates the heap to find the maximum product of the smallest element in the heap and the size of the heap. If the size of the heap becomes 1 and the element is greater than or equal to the current maximum product, it updates the maximum product. The function prints the maximum product and the size of the heap for each test case. The function handles edge cases where \(n\) is even by ensuring the middle element is not included in the heap.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- When \(n\) is even, the function correctly removes the middle element from the heap.
- The function assumes \(t > 0\) and \(n > 0\); it does not handle the case where \(t = 0\) or \(n = 0\).
- The function does not validate the input constraints for \(t\), \(n\), and the elements in \(v\) and \(p\); it should include validation to ensure these constraints are met.
- The function does not provide any error messages or handling for invalid inputs; it should handle invalid inputs gracefully, such as printing an error message and continuing to the next test case or terminating the program.
