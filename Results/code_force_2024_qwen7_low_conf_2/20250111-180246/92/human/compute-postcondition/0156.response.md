Postcondition: **`h` is a heap with one element equal to `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, `output[0]` is `4`, `output[1]` is `2`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `n` is even, `len(h)` is `1`, `l` is `1`. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]` is true, `output[0]` is set to `4` and `output[1]` remains `2`. Otherwise, no change is made to `output[0]` and `output[1]` remains `2`.**
