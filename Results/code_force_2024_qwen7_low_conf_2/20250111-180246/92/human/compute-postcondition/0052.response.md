`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. After this operation, the heap property of `h` is maintained. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in the heap, the only change is that the smallest element has been removed.

Output State: **`h` is a heap without its smallest element**
