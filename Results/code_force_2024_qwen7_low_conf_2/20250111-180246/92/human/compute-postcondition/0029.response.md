The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `v`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms.
- `v` is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom.
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The function returns two values:
- `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n`, where `v_sorted` is the list `v` sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest index `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `v`, and `p`, and return the maximum strength and the minimum index of mushrooms based on the given conditions.
