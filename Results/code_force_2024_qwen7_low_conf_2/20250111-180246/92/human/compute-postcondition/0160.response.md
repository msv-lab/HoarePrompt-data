Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap, `output[0]` is either `h[0]` if `h[0] >= 4` (and thus initially had more than one element), otherwise it remains `3`, `output[1]` is `1`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, and `n` is even.***
