The code `break` does not affect any variable values but instead breaks out of the nearest loop or switch-case construct. Since there is no loop or switch-case construct in the given code snippet, the behavior of `break` here would typically indicate an attempt to exit an imaginary construct, but it does not change any variable values. The only variables mentioned are `h` and `output`, and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`h` and `output` are tuples; if the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, then `output` remains unchanged as a tuple containing the first element of `h` in the first position and `1` in the second position. We break out of the nearest loop or if statement.**
