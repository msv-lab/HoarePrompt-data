Postcondition: **`h` is a list and `output` is a tuple. If `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output` is set to `(h[0], 1)` and `h` remains unchanged. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]` and the previous condition is false, then `output` is set to `(h[0] * l, l)`. Otherwise, `h` remains unchanged and the length of `h` remains as `l`.**
