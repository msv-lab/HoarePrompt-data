Postcondition: ***`h` is the heap excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]`, `output[1]` is `output[1]`, and `l` is `output[1]`. If `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]` is true, `h` contains the elements of the original heap plus `v[p[l - 1] - 1]`, maintaining the heap property. Otherwise, the state of the program remains as in the if part.***
