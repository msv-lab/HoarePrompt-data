Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed plus the element `1` or `2` from `v`. `output[0]` is either `h[0] * (l - 1)` or `4`, `output[1]` is either `l - 1` or `2`; `max_size` is a positive integer; `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements; `t` is `t - max_size`; `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`; `j` is `max_size - 1`; `n` is even; `l` is `l - 1`. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `output[0]` is `h[0] * (l - 1)` and `output[1]` is `l - 1`; otherwise, `output[0]` remains `4` and `output[1]` remains `2`.***
