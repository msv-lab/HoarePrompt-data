Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, and the tuple `output` is (1, 1). If the heap `h`'s first element is greater than or equal to `output`'s first element, then no changes are made to the variables.***
