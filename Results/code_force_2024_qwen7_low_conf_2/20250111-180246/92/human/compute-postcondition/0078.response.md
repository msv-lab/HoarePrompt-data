Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap containing the elements of `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for \( j \) ranging from 0 to `max_size - 1` except the smallest one, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output` is unchanged, `output[0]` is unchanged, `output[1]` is unchanged.***

Explanation:
- Since the `else` part is empty (i.e., no operations are performed when the condition `n % 2 == 0` is false), the state of the program remains unchanged in this case.
- The `if` part specifies that the smallest element from the heap `h` is removed if `n` is even. After removing the smallest element, `h` still maintains the heap property, and the smallest element is not specified in the postcondition.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition combines both scenarios (whether `n` is even or odd), stating that the heap `h` loses its smallest element (if `n` is even) and remains unchanged (if `n` is odd).
