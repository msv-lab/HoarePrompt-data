Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap, `output` is a tuple. If the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, then `output` is updated to `(h[0], 1)`. Otherwise, `h` becomes a heap with one more element, `l` decreases by 1, and the new element is `v[p[l] - 1]`. In either case, `output` is updated according to the new state of `h` and `l`.***
