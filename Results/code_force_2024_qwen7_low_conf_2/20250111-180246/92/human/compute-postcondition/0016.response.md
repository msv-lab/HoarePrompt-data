The value of `min_mushrooms` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `min_mushrooms` is 2, `max_strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `min_mushrooms` is 2, `max_strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`**
