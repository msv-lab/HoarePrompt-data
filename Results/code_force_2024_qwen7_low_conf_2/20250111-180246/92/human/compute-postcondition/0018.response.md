Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, and `min_mushrooms` is 1. Since the condition `strength == max_strength` is checked in the if part and no changes are mentioned for either the if or else part beyond the initial conditions, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
