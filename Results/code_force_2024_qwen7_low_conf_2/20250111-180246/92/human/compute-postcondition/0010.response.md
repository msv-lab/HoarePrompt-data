The code snippet assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `min_mushrooms`. Since `min_mushrooms` was not previously defined, it is initialized to `i`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `strength`, `v_sorted[0]`, and `max_strength`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]` and is equal to `max_strength`, `min_mushrooms` is 1**
