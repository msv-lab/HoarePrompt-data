Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap containing the elements \( v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1] \) for \( j \) ranging from 0 to \( \text{max\_size} - 1 \), `t` is unchanged, `n` is even, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output` is unchanged, `output[0]` is unchanged, `output[1]` is unchanged.***
