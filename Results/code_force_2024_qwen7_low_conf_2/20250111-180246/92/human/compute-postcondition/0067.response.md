The code initializes an empty list `h`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `h` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `n` is a non-negative integer and equals the input value, `v` is a list of integers from the user input, `p` is the same list as `v`, `max_size` is `(n + 2) // 2`, the heap `h` is an empty list, `output` is the maximum possible value that satisfies the conditions in the loop, `output[0]` is printed, `output[1]` is printed, `p` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**
