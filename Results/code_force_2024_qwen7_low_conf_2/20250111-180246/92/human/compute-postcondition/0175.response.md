The code `l = len(h)` calculates the length of the heap `h` and assigns it to the variable `l`. Since `h` was initially a heap with its smallest element removed, the number of elements in `h` is one less than the original heap size. However, the exact number of elements in `h` is not specified in the initial state, only that the smallest element has been removed. Therefore, `l` will be the number of elements left in the heap.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with its smallest element removed; `l` is the number of elements in `h`**
