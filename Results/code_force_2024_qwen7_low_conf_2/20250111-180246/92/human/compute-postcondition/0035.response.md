Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2. If the heap `h` contains [2], the output is (4, 2). Otherwise, the heap `h` contains [1], `l` is 1, the output is (1, 1), and the condition `(h[0] * l >= output[0])` evaluates to true.***
