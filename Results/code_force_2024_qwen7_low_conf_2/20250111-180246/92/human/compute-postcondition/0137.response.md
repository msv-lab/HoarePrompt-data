Postcondition: **`h` is a heap containing elements from the list `[1, 2, 3]` based on the values of `p[n - j] - 1` for `j` from `0` to `max_size - 1`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `output[0]` is the maximum product of the heap size and the root element value found during the loop, `output[1]` is the corresponding heap size when `output[0]` is achieved, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, and `n` is even**
