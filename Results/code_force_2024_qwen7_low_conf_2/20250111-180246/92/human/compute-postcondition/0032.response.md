Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, the heap `h` contains [1], `l` is 1, the output is (4, 2), `h[0]` is 1 (since `h[0] < v[p[l - 1] - 1]` is true and the value of `h[0]` is set to 1), and the condition `(h[0] * l >= output[0])` evaluates to true***
