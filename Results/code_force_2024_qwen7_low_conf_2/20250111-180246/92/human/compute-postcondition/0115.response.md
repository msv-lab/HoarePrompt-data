`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` does not contain its smallest element in the initial state, the smallest element is popped, and `h` will no longer contain that smallest element. The length of `h`, stored in `l`, will decrease by 1.

Output State: **`h` does not contain its new smallest element (the one just removed), `l` is the length of `h` - 1**
