Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2. If `len(h) == 1`, then the tuple `output` is (1, 1) and no changes are made to other variables. Otherwise, `l` is 0, and if `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then `output[0]` is 0. Otherwise, the smallest element from `h` remains unchanged.***
