Postcondition: **`h` is a heap containing `[3]`, `output[0]` is `3`, `output[1]` is `1`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, and `n` is even, with the condition that if the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to `4`, then `output[0]` is set to `3` and `output[1]` is set to `1`.**
