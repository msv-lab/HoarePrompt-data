Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 2
  - `n` is a positive integer
  - `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`
  - `min_mushrooms` is 1

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will execute if `i` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

2. **Current State:**
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and become 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer.
   - `strength` and `min_mushrooms` are not affected by the loop condition and remain the same.

### New State:
- `i` becomes 3.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `strength` remains `2 * v_sorted[1]`.
- `min_mushrooms` remains 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, and `min_mushrooms` is 1.**
