Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with the smallest element removed plus the element `1` or `2` from `v`. `output[0]` is 4, `output[1]` is 2, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, `n` is even, `l` is the new length of `h` which is `l - 1`.***
