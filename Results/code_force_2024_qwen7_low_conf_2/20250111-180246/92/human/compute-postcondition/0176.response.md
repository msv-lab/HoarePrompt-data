`heapq.heappop(h)` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` is a heap with its smallest element removed, removing the smallest element again will change the contents of `h`. The value of `l` (the number of elements in `h`) will be reduced by one.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with its second smallest element removed; `l` is `l-1`**
