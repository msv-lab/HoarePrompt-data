The code `heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since there is no initial state provided specifically for `h`, we assume `h` is a non-empty heap (as `heapq.heappop` would fail on an empty heap). After executing this line, the smallest element from the heap `h` is removed and returned.

Output State: **`h` is a heap with its smallest element removed**
