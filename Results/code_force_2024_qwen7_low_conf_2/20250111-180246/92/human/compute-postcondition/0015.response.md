The code sets `max_strength` to the value of `strength`. The value of `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, and `max_strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, `max_strength` is `2 * v_sorted[1]`**
