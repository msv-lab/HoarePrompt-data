Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `h`: A non-empty heap with an additional element (one of 1, 2, or 3 depending on `p[n - 1 - j]`).
   - `max_size`: A positive integer.
   - `p`: A list of integers with at least `max_size` elements.
   - `output[0]`: Initialized to a default value.
   - `output[1]`: Initialized to a default value.
   - `t`: `t - 1`.
   - `v`: `[1, 2, 3]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `max_size - 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is `j < max_size`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, after the previous iteration, `j` is one less than `max_size`. Therefore, `j` is `max_size - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `max_size`. Hence, `j` needs to be set to `0` and `max_size` remains the same.

4. **Other States:**
   - `h`: The heap will remain unchanged as the heap operations inside the loop body are not specified and we are only concerned with the initial state at the start of the next iteration.
   - `p`, `output[0]`, `output[1]`, `t`, and `v` will remain the same as they are not modified within the loop body.

Based on the above reasoning, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`h` is a non-empty heap with an additional element (one of 1, 2, or 3 depending on `p[n - 1 - 0]`), `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `output[0]` is initialized to a default value, `output[1]` is initialized to a default value, `t` is `t - 1`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is 0**.
