The variable `min_mushrooms` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `strength`, and `max_strength` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, `max_strength` is `v_sorted[0]`, and `min_mushrooms` is 1**
