Postcondition: ***`h` and `output` are tuples. If the first element of `h` is greater than or equal to the first element of `output`, then `output` remains unchanged as a tuple containing the first element of `h` in the first position and `1` in the second position. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only covers the if case.***
