Postcondition: **`h` is the heap excluding its smallest element, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, `output[0]` is `len(h) * h[0]`, `output[1]` is `output[1]`, and `l` is `output[1]`. The first element of `h` is smaller than the element at index `p[l-1] - 1` in `v`.**
