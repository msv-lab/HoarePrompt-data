Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap containing the elements of `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]` for \( j \) ranging from 0 to `max_size - 1` except the smallest one, `t` is unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `max_size` is unchanged, and `output[0]` and `output[1]` are updated as follows: if the root of the heap (`h[0]`) is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output[0]` remains unchanged and `output[1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `output[0]` is updated to `h[0]` and `output[1]` is set to 1.***
