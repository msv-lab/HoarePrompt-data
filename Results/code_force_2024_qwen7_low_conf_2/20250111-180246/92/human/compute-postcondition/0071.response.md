According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `max_size - 1`. The state at the end of the previous iteration provides us with the current value of `j` and the other variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `h` is a heap with an additional element `v[p[n - 1 - j] - 1]`.
- `v` is unchanged.
- `p` is unchanged.
- `j` is unchanged.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1. Since the loop condition is `for j in range(max_size)`, the loop will continue if `j < max_size`.

Step-by-step:
1. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was unchanged, meaning it had a specific value (let's denote it as `j_end_prev`).
2. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `j_end_prev + 1`.
3. The heap `h` now contains the additional element `v[p[n - 1 - (j_end_prev + 1)] - 1]`.
4. The variables `v`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`h` is a heap with an additional element `v[p[n - 1 - (j + 1)] - 1]`, `v` is unchanged, `p` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`**
