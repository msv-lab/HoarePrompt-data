Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap with its smallest two elements potentially changed. If `h[0] * l >= output[0]`, then either the heap includes the value `v[p[l-1]-1]` as the new second smallest element, and `l` is decremented by 1; or the heap remains unchanged with `l` as `l-1`. In both cases, `output` is `(h[0] * l, l)`.***
