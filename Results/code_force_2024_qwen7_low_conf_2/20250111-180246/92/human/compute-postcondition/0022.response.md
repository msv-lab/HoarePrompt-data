The code sets `max_strength` to the value of `strength`. The value of `strength` is given by `3 * v_sorted[2]`, and since `v_sorted[2]` is not specified, we keep it in its original form. The values of `i`, `n`, and `min_mushrooms` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`, `min_mushrooms` is 1, `max_strength` is `3 * v_sorted[2]`**
