Postcondition: ***`h` is a heap, `output[0]` is `4` if `h` initially has more than one element, otherwise `output[0]` is `3`, `output[1]` is `2`, `max_size` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of integers with at least `max_size` elements, `t` is `t - max_size`, `v` is `[1, 2, 3]`, `j` is `max_size - 1`, and `n` is even.***

Explanation:
- If `len(h) == 1` (if part), then after executing the if block, `h` becomes a heap containing `[3]`, `output[0]` becomes `3`, and `output[1]` remains `1`.
- If `len(h) != 1` (else part), then after executing the else block, `h` becomes a heap with one element equal to `v[p[j] - 1]`, which is `v[p[max_size - 1] - 1]`, and `output[0]` is set to `4` if `h[0] * l >= output[0]` is true, otherwise `output[0]` remains `4` and `output[1]` remains `2`.

Since we need to cover both cases in the postcondition, we summarize the overall state after the if-else block executes.
