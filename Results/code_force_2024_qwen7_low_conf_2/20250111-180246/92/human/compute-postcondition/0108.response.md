Postcondition: **`h` is a heap. If `len(h) == 1`, then the root of the heap (`h[0]`) is compared with `output[0]`: if `h[0]` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output[0]` remains unchanged and `output[1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `output[0]` is updated to `h[0]` and `output[1]` is set to 1. If `len(h) != 1`, then the two smallest elements are removed from the heap, and if the new root (`h[0]`) multiplied by `l` is greater than or equal to `output[0]`, then `output[0]` is updated to `h[0] * l` and `output[1]` is set to `l`; otherwise, `output[0]` and `output[1]` retain their previous values. `t`, `n`, `v`, `p`, `max_size`, and `l` remain unchanged.**
