`heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `h` can either be `[1]` or `[2]`. In both cases, heappop will remove the smallest element and return it.

- If `h` is `[1]`, the smallest element is `1`. After popping, `h` becomes an empty list `[]`.
- If `h` is `[2]`, the smallest element is `2`. After popping, `h` becomes an empty list `[]`.

Other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `v` is [1, 2, 3], `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_size` is (n + 2) // 2, and the heap `h` is an empty list `[]`.**
