You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent
and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which
has magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum
strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms
in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the
elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.
Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation
of numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic
power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .
Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew
the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to
stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for
gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of
mushrooms.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from
1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a
permutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
200\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.

The second line contains an array v of size n (1\le v_i \le 10^9 ) — the magic
powers of the mushrooms.

The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum
strength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms
that Kirill needs to use for this.

Note

In the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so
the strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \cdot \min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \cdot
\min(9, 8) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with
index 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .

# Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, v, p)
    print(*result)

def func_1(n, v, p):
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        strength = i * v_sorted[i - 1]
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i
        elif strength == max_strength:
            min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)
    return (max_strength, min_mushrooms)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `v`, and `p`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms.
- `v` is a list of positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom.
- `p` is a list of integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The function first sorts the list `v` in non-decreasing order. It then iterates through the sorted list to calculate the product of each index `i` and the corresponding element `v_sorted[i - 1]`. During this iteration, it keeps track of the maximum strength (`max_strength`) and the minimum index (`min_mushrooms`) that achieves this maximum strength.

After the loop, the function returns two values:
- `max_strength`, which is the maximum value of `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` for `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `min_mushrooms`, which is the smallest index `i` such that `i * v_sorted[i - 1]` equals `max_strength`.

Potential edge cases:
- If the list `v` is empty or `n` is zero, the function will still execute the loop but will result in `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` being undefined (as the loop won't run).

Missing functionality:
- The parameter `p` is not used in the function, so it can be considered redundant for the purpose of calculating `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms`.
