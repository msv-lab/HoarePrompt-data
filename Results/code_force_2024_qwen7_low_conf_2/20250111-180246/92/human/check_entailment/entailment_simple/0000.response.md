Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling of Permutations**: The problem statement mentions that if Kirill picks only \( k \) mushrooms, the magic power of all mushrooms with indices \( p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k-1} \) will become 0. The program does not account for this constraint at all. Instead, it simply sorts the magic powers of the mushrooms and calculates the strength of the elixir based on the sorted values without considering the effect of the permutation.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Elixir Strength**: The program assumes that the maximum strength of the elixir can be calculated by simply iterating through the sorted magic powers and calculating the product of the current index and the corresponding magic power. This approach ignores the fact that the magic power of certain mushrooms can become 0 due to the permutation constraint.

3. **Output Format**: The program returns the maximum strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms required to achieve this strength. However, the program does not correctly handle the permutation constraint to ensure that the selected mushrooms still meet the condition of having non-zero magic powers according to the permutation.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Consider the permutation constraint to determine which mushrooms' magic powers become 0.
- Calculate the maximum strength of the elixir while respecting the permutation constraint.
- Find the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve the maximum strength.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Create a dictionary to map original indices to permuted indices
    perm_to_orig = {p[i]: i + 1 for i in range(n)}
    
    # Sort the mushrooms based on their magic power in descending order
    v_sorted = sorted(v, reverse=True)
    
    max_strength = 0
    min_mushrooms = n
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the effective magic power after applying the permutation
        effective_power = v_sorted[i - 1]
        if perm_to_orig[i] <= i:
            effective_power = 0
        
        strength = i * effective_power
        
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            min_mushrooms = i
        elif strength == max_strength:
            min_mushrooms = min(min_mushrooms, i)
    
    print(max_strength, min_mushrooms)
```

This corrected version correctly handles the permutation constraint and ensures that the magic powers of the mushrooms remain non-zero as required by the problem statement.
