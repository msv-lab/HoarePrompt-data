Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of mushrooms `n`, the array of magic powers `v`, and the permutation `p`.
3. It then calls a function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `v`, and `p`.
4. The function `func_1` sorts the array `v` in descending order.
5. It initializes `max_strength` to 0 and `min_mushrooms` to `n`.
6. It iterates through the sorted `v_sorted` array and calculates the potential strength of the elixir for each number of mushrooms picked.
7. It updates `max_strength` and `min_mushrooms` accordingly.
8. Finally, it returns a tuple containing the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms needed.

The logic of the program seems to correctly follow the problem description:
- It considers all possible numbers of mushrooms that can be picked.
- It calculates the strength of the elixir for each possible number of mushrooms.
- It keeps track of the maximum strength and the minimum number of mushrooms needed to achieve that strength.

However, the key part is ensuring that the permutation `p` is considered in the logic. The permutation `p` indicates which mushrooms' magic power becomes zero if chosen. The current implementation does not seem to use the permutation `p` in its calculations. 

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the current implementation does not correctly handle the permutation `p`. The permutation `p` should be used to determine which mushrooms' magic power becomes zero when a certain number of mushrooms are picked.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to incorporate the permutation `p` into the logic to accurately determine the strength of the elixir and the minimum number of mushrooms required.
