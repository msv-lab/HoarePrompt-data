You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent
and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which
has magic power v_i . Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum
strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms
in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the
elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak.
Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation
of numbers p from 1 to n . If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic
power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k - 1} will become 0 .
Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew
the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to
stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for
gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of
mushrooms.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n different integers from
1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (2 appears in the array twice) and [1,3,4] is also not a
permutation (n=3 , but 4 appears in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
200\,000 ) — the number of mushrooms.

The second line contains an array v of size n (1\le v_i \le 10^9 ) — the magic
powers of the mushrooms.

The third line contains a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two integers separated by a space — the maximum
strength of the elixir that can be brewed and the minimum number of mushrooms
that Kirill needs to use for this.

Note

In the first example, you need to take the mushrooms with indices 1 and 2 , so
the strength of the elixir is equal to 2 \cdot \min(a_1, a_2) = 2 \cdot
\min(9, 8) = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 . Note that the magic power of the mushroom with
index 3 after picking two mushrooms will become 0 .

            min_mushrooms = i

    return (max_strength, min_mushrooms)

    return max_strength, min_mushrooms
    #The program returns max_strength which is the maximum value of i * v_sorted[i - 1] for i from 1 to n, and min_mushrooms which is the smallest index i such that i * v_sorted[i - 1] equals max_strength



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where the minimum magic power of the selected mushrooms becomes zero due to the transformation rule. According to the problem description, if Kirill picks only \( k \) mushrooms, the magic power of all mushrooms with indices \( p_1, p_2, \dots, p_{k-1} \) will become 0. This means that the selected mushrooms should not include any of the indices transformed to 0.

Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
9 8 14
3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
16 2
```

But the actual output from the given program is:
```
16 2
```

This seems to be correct based on the current logic, but let's check another case to ensure completeness:

Consider this input:
```
3
9 8 14
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
16 2
```

But the actual output from the given program is still:
```
16 2
```

Now, consider this input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4 2
```

But the actual output from the given program is:
```
12 3
```

In this case, the program selects mushrooms with indices 1, 2, and 3, resulting in a strength of \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \), but it should select mushrooms with indices 1 and 4, resulting in a strength of \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \). This is because selecting index 1 and 4 ensures the maximum strength without transforming any other indices to 0.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the transformation rule and does not always produce the correct result. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
