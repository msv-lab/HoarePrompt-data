The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It then determines whether certain conditions involving the maximum values, minimum values, and intermediate values in the list \( a \) can be satisfied. If these conditions are met, it appends 'YES' along with specific values to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to the standard output, one per line.
