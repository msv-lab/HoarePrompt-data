The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial value of `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`. After sorting, the list `a` becomes `[1, 2, 4]` since it is already sorted.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 3, `x` is `int(data[9])`, `index` is 15, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2', 'NO']`, `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`**
