The code `x = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 3, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[4]`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `data[4]`, let's denote it as `value_of_data_4`.

Therefore, the updated value of `x` is `value_of_data_4`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (derived from `data[1]`), `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list**
