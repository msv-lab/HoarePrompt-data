`gcd1` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a[-1]` and `a[-2]`. From the initial state, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, so `a[-1]` is `4` and `a[-2]` is `2`. The GCD of `4` and `2` is `2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (derived from `data[1]`), `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is an empty list, `gcd1` is `2`**
