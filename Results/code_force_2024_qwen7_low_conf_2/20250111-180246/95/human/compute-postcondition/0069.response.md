The `continue` statement in Python is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect, and all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is `n_val`, `x` is `x_val`, `index` is `17 + n_val`, `results` is a list containing `'NO', f'{n_val - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])), gcd1, and1, and2, 'YES', f'{n_val - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])), '2 {a[0]} {a[1]}'`, `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`, `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`, `and2` is `data[17] & data[18]`, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n_val]`**
