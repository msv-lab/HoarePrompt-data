`results` is a list containing `'NO'`. The code appends `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated list in `results` is `['NO', 'YES']`.

Output State: **`t` is 1 (greater than 1); `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`; `index` is 17 + `data[15]`; `results` is a list containing `'NO', 'YES'`; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`; `and2` is 0; `a` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`; `gcd2` is 4**
