The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is 3; `x` is 4; `index` is 15; `results` is ['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', '1 4', '2 1 2', 'NO', 'YES', '2 4 2', '1 1 2', 'YES', '1 4', '2 1 2']; `gcd1` is 2; `and1` is 0; `and2` is 0; `a` is [1, 2, 4]; `gcd2` is 4; `and2` is 0.**
