The code `continue` is used within a loop (such as a for or while loop) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration. Since the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside of the loop, the variables retain their previous values. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`**
