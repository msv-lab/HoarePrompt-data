`index` is incremented by `n`. The value of `index` was initially `5`, so adding `n` to it results in `index` becoming `5 + n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer (derived from `data[1]`), `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[5:5+n]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (derived from `data[1]`), `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is a list of `n` integers derived from `data[5:5+n]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is an empty list**
