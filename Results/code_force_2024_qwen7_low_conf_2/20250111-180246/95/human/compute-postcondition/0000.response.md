The code snippet `index = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `index`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `index`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 4·10^5, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5, `index` is 0.**
