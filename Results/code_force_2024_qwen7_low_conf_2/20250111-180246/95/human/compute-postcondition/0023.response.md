The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. The string is constructed using the value of `n - 2` followed by the elements of `a[2:]` (which are `4`). 

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. The value of `n - 2` is calculated.
2. The elements of `a[2:]` are `4`.
3. These values are joined into a single string separated by spaces.
4. The resulting string is appended to `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`
- `n` is an input integer
- `x` is `value_of_data_4`
- `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`
- `index` is `5 + n`
- `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES']`
- `gcd1` is `2`
- `and1` is `0`
- `and2` is `0`

After executing the code, the updated `results` will be `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4']`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`, `and2` is `0`**
