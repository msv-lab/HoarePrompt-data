The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by the value of `n`. Given that `n` is 3, `index` will be incremented by 3. The initial value of `index` is 12, so after the increment, `index` will be 15. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 3, `x` is `int(data[9])`, `index` is 15, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2', 'NO']`, `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is [1, 2, 4]**
