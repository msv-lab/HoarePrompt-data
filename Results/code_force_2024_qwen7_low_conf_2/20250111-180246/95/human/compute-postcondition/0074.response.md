The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `x` are positive integers such that \(4 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq x \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\). Additionally, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 4 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the given constraints and relationships, the function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it takes `n`, `x`, and a list `a` as inputs. The function does not have a specified return value in the given information, which implies it might perform some operations but does not explicitly return anything.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a parameter `t`, which indicates the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes `n`, `x`, and a list `a` without explicitly returning any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes two positive integers `n` and `x` and a list `a` of `n` positive integers without explicitly returning any value.**
