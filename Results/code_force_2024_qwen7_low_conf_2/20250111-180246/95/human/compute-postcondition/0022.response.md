The code snippet appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. The list `results` was originally `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2']`. After appending `'YES'`, the list will become `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES']`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`, `and2` is `0`, and the current value of `gcd2` is greater than `and2 + x`**
