Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 3, `x` is 4, `index` is 15, `results` is ['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2', 'NO', 'YES', '2 4 2', '1 1 2'], `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is [1, 2, 4]. If `gcd1` is greater than `and1 + x`, the `results` list is updated with 'YES' at the current index. Otherwise, the `results` list remains unchanged.***
