The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`, `index` is 17 + `data[15]`, `results` is a list containing `'NO', 'YES', f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'`, `f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2]))`, `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`, `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`, `and2` is 0, `a` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`, `gcd2` is 4**
