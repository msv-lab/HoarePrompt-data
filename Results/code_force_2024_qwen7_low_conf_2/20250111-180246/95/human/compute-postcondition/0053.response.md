The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` is 15. After the increment, the value of `index` becomes 17. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 (greater than 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`, `index` is 17, `results` is a list containing `'NO'`, `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is [1, 2, 4], `gcd2` is 4, `and2` is 0**
