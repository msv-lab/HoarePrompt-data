The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 3, `x` is 4, `index` is 15, `results` is ['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2', 'NO', 'YES', '2 4 2', '1 1 2'], `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is [1, 2, 4]**
