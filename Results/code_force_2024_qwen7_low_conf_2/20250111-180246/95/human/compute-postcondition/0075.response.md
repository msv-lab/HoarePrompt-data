Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It then determines whether certain conditions involving the maximum values, minimum values, and intermediate values in the list \( a \) can be satisfied. If these conditions are met, it appends 'YES' along with specific values to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to the standard output, one per line.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function handles the case where the list \( a \) has only two elements, in which case the sorting and slicing operations would result in empty slices, leading to potential errors. However, since the function checks if the list has more than two elements before performing these operations, this edge case is handled.
- The function assumes that the input data is correctly formatted and that the list \( a \) contains exactly \( n \) elements. There is no validation to check if this condition is met, which could lead to errors if the input is malformed.
- The function relies on the `func_1` and `reduce` functions, but their implementations are not provided. Therefore, the behavior of these functions is assumed to be correct based on their names, but their exact behavior should be verified to ensure the function works as intended.
