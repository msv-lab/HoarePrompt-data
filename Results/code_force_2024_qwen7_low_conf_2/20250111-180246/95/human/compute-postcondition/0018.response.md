Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`. If `gcd1 > and1 + x`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the results list does not change regardless of the condition evaluation.***
