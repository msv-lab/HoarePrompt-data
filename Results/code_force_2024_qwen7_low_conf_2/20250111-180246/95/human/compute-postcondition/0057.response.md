The code `gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])` assigns the result of calling `func_1` with `a[-1]` and `a[-2]` as arguments to the variable `gcd1`. Since the initial value of `gcd1` is 2, the output of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])` will replace the value of `gcd1`. However, the specific function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `gcd1` without knowing what `func_1` does. But we know that `gcd1` will be updated to the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 (greater than 1); `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`; `index` is 17 + `data[15]`; `results` is a list containing `'NO'`; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is 0; `and2` is 0; `a` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`; `gcd2` is 4; `and2` is 0**
