`results` is a list that appends the string `'YES'` to itself. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes `results` now being a list that originally contained `'NO', f'{n_val - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])), gcd1, and1, and2`, and also contains `'YES'`.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is `n_val`, `x` is `x_val`, `index` is `17 + n_val`, `results` is a list containing `'NO', f'{n_val - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])), gcd1, and1, and2, and 'YES'`, `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`, `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`, `and2` is `data[17] & data[18]`, `a` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n_val]`.**
