The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. Since the condition `gcd2 > and2 + x` is not mentioned and no changes to `gcd2`, `and2`, or `x` occur within the given code snippet, the value of `results` remains unchanged except for the new entry `'NO'`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2', 'NO']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`, `and2` is `0`.**
