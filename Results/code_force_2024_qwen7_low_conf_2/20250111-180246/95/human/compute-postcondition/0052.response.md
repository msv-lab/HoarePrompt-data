The code snippet `x = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Given that `index` is 15, the code becomes `x = int(data[16])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `t` is 1 (greater than 1)
- `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`
- `x` is initially 4
- `index` is 15
- `results` is a list containing `'NO'`
- `gcd1` is 2
- `and1` is 0
- `and2` is 0
- `a` is [1, 2, 4]
- `gcd2` is 4
- `and2` is 0

After executing the code, `x` will be updated to the integer value of `data[16]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 (greater than 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`, `index` is 15, `results` is a list containing `'NO'`, `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is [1, 2, 4], `gcd2` is 4, `and2` is 0**
