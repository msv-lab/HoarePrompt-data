The value of `index` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 3 to 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (derived from `data[1]`), `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5, `index` is 5, `results` is an empty list**
