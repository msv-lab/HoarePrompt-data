The code snippet appends a formatted string to the `results` list. The string to be appended is `f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'`. This means the last two elements of the list `a` are included in the string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1 (greater than 1)
- `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`
- `index` is 17 + `data[15]`
- `results` is a list containing `'NO', 'YES'`
- `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`
- `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`
- `and2` is 0
- `a` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`
- `gcd2` is 4

After executing the line `results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')`:
- `results` will now contain `['NO', 'YES', f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}']`

Output State: **`t` is 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`; `index` is 17 + `data[15]`; `results` is a list containing `'NO', 'YES', f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}'`; `gcd1` is the result of `func_1(a[-1], a[-2])`; `and1` is the result of `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`; `and2` is 0; `a` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`; `gcd2` is 4**
