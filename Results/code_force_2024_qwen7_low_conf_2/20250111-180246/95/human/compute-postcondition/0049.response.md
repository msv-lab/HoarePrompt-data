`results` appends the string `'NO'`. This means that the list `results` now contains `'NO'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is 3; `x` is 4; `index` is 15; `results` is a list containing `'NO'`; `gcd1` is 2; `and1` is 0; `and2` is 0; `a` is [1, 2, 4]; `gcd2` is 4; `and2` is 0.**
