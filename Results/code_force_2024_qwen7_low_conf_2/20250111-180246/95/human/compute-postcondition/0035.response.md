The code updates the value of `gcd1` by calling a function `func_1` with `a[-1]` (which is 4) and `a[-2]` (which is 2). Since the function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, we assume it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two integers passed to it. The GCD of 4 and 2 is 2.

So, `gcd1` remains 2 after the call to `func_1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is 3, `x` is 4, `index` is 15, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2', 'NO']`, `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`**
