The code initializes an empty list called `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables `t`, `n`, `x`, `a`, or `index`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is `int(data[1])`, `n` is a positive integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5, `x` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 4·10^5, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list**
