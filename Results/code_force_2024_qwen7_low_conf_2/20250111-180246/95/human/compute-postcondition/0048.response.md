Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is 3; `x` is 4; `index` is 15; `results` is a list of strings; `gcd1` is 2; `and1` is 0; `and2` is 0; `a` is [1, 2, 4]; `gcd2` is 4; `and2` is 0. If `gcd2` is greater than `and2 + x`, then `results` may be updated to include additional 'YES' and '2 4 2' entries. Otherwise, the list `results` remains unchanged.***
