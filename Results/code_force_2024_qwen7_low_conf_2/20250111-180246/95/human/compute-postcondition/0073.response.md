The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the joined string of `results` (with each element separated by a newline character) followed by another newline character to the standard output. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `results`. Since no variables are assigned new values within this line of code, the only information we can update is related to the action performed.

Output State: **`results` is joined with newline characters and written to standard output.**
