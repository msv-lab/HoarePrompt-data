The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` maps each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` to an integer and creates a new list `a`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is 1 (greater than 1)
- `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`
- `index` is 17
- `results` is a list containing `'NO'`
- `gcd1` is 2
- `and1` is 0
- `and2` is 0
- `a` is [1, 2, 4]
- `gcd2` is 4
- `and2` is 0

Let's determine the new value of `a`:

- The slice `data[index:index + n]` is `data[17:17 + n]`.
- Since `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, we need to find the value of `data[15]`.

Assuming `data[15]` is a known integer, let's denote this integer as `k`. So, `n = k`.

The slice `data[17:17 + k]` is taken and each element in this slice is converted to an integer and stored in a new list.

Given that the initial `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, and since the code replaces the existing `a` with the new list, the updated `a` will be the list obtained by converting `data[17:17 + k]` to integers.

Since the exact value of `data[17:17 + k]` is not specified, we represent the new `a` as the list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`.

Output State: **`t` is 1 (greater than 1), `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`, `index` is 17, `results` is a list containing `'NO'`, `gcd1` is 2, `and1` is 0, `and2` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`, `gcd2` is 4, `and2` is 0**
