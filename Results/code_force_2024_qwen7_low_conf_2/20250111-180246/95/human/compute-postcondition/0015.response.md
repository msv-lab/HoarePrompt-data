The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. Specifically, it adds the string `'2 4 2'` to the list because `a[-1]` is `4` and `a[-2]` is `2`.

- `t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]` (unchanged).
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged).
- `x` is `value_of_data_4` (unchanged).
- `a` is `[1, 2, 4]` (unchanged).
- `index` is `5 + n` (unchanged).
- `results` is initially `['YES']` and now includes `'2 4 2'`.
- `gcd1` is `2` (unchanged).
- `and1` is `0` (unchanged).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`**
