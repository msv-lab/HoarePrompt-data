Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`, `and2` is `0`. If `gcd2 > and2 + x`, then `results` is updated to include additional entries as specified. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.***
