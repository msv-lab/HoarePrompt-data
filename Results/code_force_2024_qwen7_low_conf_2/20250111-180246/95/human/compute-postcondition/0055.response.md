The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given that `n` is the integer value of `data[15]` and `index` is initially 17, the new value of `index` will be `17 + data[15]`.

Since the exact value of `data[15]` is not specified, we will keep it in its symbolic form. Therefore, the updated value of `index` will be `17 + data[15]`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 (greater than 1); `n` is the integer value of `data[15]`; `x` is the integer value of `data[16]`; `index` is 17 + `data[15]`; `results` is a list containing `'NO'`; `gcd1` is 2; `and1` is 0; `and2` is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[17:17 + n]`; `gcd2` is 4; `and2` is 0**
