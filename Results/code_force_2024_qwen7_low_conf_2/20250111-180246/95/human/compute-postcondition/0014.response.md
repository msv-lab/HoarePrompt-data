The code `results.append('YES')` appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after this operation, it will contain the single element `'YES'`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is ['YES'], `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`**
