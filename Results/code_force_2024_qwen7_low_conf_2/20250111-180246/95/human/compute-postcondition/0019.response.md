`gcd2` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in the slice `a[2:]`, which consists of `[4]`. Since the gcd of `[4]` is `4`, `gcd2` is set to `4`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`, `gcd2` is `4`.**
