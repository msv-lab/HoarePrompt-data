The `continue` statement in the provided code does not affect the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop (which is not shown here). Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[1]`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `value_of_data_4`, `a` is `[1, 2, 4]`, `index` is `5 + n`, `results` is `['YES', '2 4 2', 'n - 2 1 2', 'YES', f'{n - 2} 4', '2 1 2']`, `gcd1` is `2`, `and1` is `0`, `and2` is `0`**
