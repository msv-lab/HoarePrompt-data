t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20,000. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 4·10^5. Additionally, there is an array a of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5 for all elements a_i. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5, and the sum of the maximum values of a_i for each test case does not exceed 4·10^5.
