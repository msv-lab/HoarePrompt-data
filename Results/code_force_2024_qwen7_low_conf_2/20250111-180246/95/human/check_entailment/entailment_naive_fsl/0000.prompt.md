You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
