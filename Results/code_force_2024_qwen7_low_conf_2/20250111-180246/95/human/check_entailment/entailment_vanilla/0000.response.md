Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly defined. `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct. `func_2` is intended to solve the main problem but has some issues with variable scope and usage of imported modules.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads input from `sys.stdin`, assuming `data` is a pre-defined list of strings representing the input. This needs to be corrected to properly read input from `sys.stdin`.
   - The logic for determining the outcome (`YES` or `NO`) is implemented correctly for most cases, but there are some potential issues with how the results are structured and printed.
   - The program checks if the GCD of the last two elements in the sorted array is greater than the bitwise AND of the rest of the elements plus `x`. This is a valid approach if the GCD is taken from the last two elements.
   - The program also checks if the GCD of the first two elements and the rest of the elements (excluding the first two) is greater than the bitwise AND of the first two elements plus `x`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The use of `reduce` with `gcd` should directly call the `func_1` function since `reduce` is not imported.
   - The variable `data` is not defined in the provided code snippet. The correct way to read input would be using `input()` and storing it in a list.
   - The `results` list should be constructed and printed correctly without unnecessary spaces and ensuring the format is as specified.

Given these points, let's re-evaluate the correctness:

The core logic of the program appears to be correct for determining whether Kirill can win based on the given rules. However, the implementation has issues related to reading input and structuring the output. 

Correctness: **False**

To make the program fully correct, you would need to adjust the input reading and output formatting as mentioned above.
