### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the original assessment step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The original function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers.
   - However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that this function is used incorrectly in the context of the problem. The GCD needs to be calculated for all red numbers, not just the last two. The current implementation is flawed because it only considers the last two elements in the sorted array.

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The original code calculates `gcd1` and `gcd2` incorrectly. `gcd1` is the GCD of the last two elements, and `gcd2` is the GCD of all elements except the first two. This is not what the problem requires.
   - The corrected version suggests calculating the GCD of all red numbers using `gcd_all(arr)`. This approach is more aligned with the problem requirements.

3. **Bitwise AND Calculation**:
   - Similarly, the original code calculates `and1` and `and2` incorrectly. `and1` is the bitwise AND of the first two elements, and `and2` is the bitwise AND of all elements except the first two. This is not what the problem requires.
   - The corrected version suggests calculating the bitwise AND of all blue numbers using `bit_and_all(arr)`. This approach is more aligned with the problem requirements.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4 1
     4 3 1 8
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - Current program output:
     ```
     YES
     2 8 4
     2 3 1
     ```
   - The GCD of `4` and `8` is `4`, and the bitwise AND of `3` is `3`. Since `4` is not greater than `3 + 1`, the output should be `NO`.
   - The corrected version should handle this case correctly.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the current implementation. The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses these issues by computing the GCD of all red numbers and the bitwise AND of all blue numbers.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided corrected version of the program aligns with the problem requirements and addresses the issues identified in the original assessment.
