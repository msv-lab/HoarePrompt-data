You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array, and b is an integer representing the number x.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original elements in the list `a`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original elements in the list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the list `a`. After executing the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original elements in the list, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of the list elements. This process handles the case where the list `a` can contain any number of integers, including the case where the list is empty. If the list is empty, the function will return 0 as the GCD, since the GCD of an empty set of numbers is defined to be 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and x are positive integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 4·10^5. a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5.

            continue

        and2 = a[0] & a[1]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It then determines whether certain conditions involving the maximum values, minimum values, and intermediate values in the list \( a \) can be satisfied. If these conditions are met, it appends 'YES' along with specific values to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to the standard output, one per line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly defined. `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is correct. `func_2` is intended to solve the main problem but has some issues with variable scope and usage of imported modules.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads input from `sys.stdin`, assuming `data` is a pre-defined list of strings representing the input. This needs to be corrected to properly read input from `sys.stdin`.
   - The logic for determining the outcome (`YES` or `NO`) is implemented correctly for most cases, but there are some potential issues with how the results are structured and printed.
   - The program checks if the GCD of the last two elements in the sorted array is greater than the bitwise AND of the rest of the elements plus `x`. This is a valid approach if the GCD is taken from the last two elements.
   - The program also checks if the GCD of the first two elements and the rest of the elements (excluding the first two) is greater than the bitwise AND of the first two elements plus `x`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The use of `reduce` with `gcd` should directly call the `func_1` function since `reduce` is not imported.
   - The variable `data` is not defined in the provided code snippet. The correct way to read input would be using `input()` and storing it in a list.
   - The `results` list should be constructed and printed correctly without unnecessary spaces and ensuring the format is as specified.

Given these points, let's re-evaluate the correctness:

The core logic of the program appears to be correct for determining whether Kirill can win based on the given rules. However, the implementation has issues related to reading input and structuring the output. 

Correctness: **False**

To make the program fully correct, you would need to adjust the input reading and output formatting as mentioned above.
