You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys
import math
from functools import reduce

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array, and b is an integer representing the number x.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original elements in the list `a`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original elements in the list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the list `a`. After executing the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original elements in the list, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of the list elements. This process handles the case where the list `a` can contain any number of integers, including the case where the list is empty. If the list is empty, the function will return 0 as the GCD, since the GCD of an empty set of numbers is defined to be 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and x are positive integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 4·10^5 and 0 ≤ x ≤ 4·10^5. a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 4·10^5.
def func_2():
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a.sort()
        
        gcd1 = func_1(a[-1], a[-2])
        
        and1 = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])
        
        if gcd1 > and1 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
            continue
        
        gcd2 = reduce(gcd, a[2:])
        
        and2 = a[0] & a[1]
        
        if gcd2 > and2 + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[2:])))
            results.append(f'2 {a[0]} {a[1]}')
            continue
        
        results.append('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State:
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. It then determines whether certain conditions involving the maximum values, minimum values, and intermediate values in the list \( a \) can be satisfied. If these conditions are met, it appends 'YES' along with specific values to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to the standard output, one per line.
