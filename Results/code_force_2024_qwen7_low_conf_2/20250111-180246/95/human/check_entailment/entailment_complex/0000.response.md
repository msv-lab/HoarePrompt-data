### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - Kirill and Anton play a game with an array of integers `a` of length `n`.
   - Kirill chooses 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
   - Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
   - Kirill calculates the GCD of the red numbers.
   - Anton calculates the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and adds `x` to the result.
   - Kirill wins if the GCD of the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of the blue numbers and `x`.

2. **Functions Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the GCD of a list of integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - **func_2**: This function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it:
     - Reads the input values `n`, `x`, and the array `a`.
     - Sorts the array `a`.
     - Computes the GCD of the last two elements (`a[-1]` and `a[-2]`) and the bitwise AND of all but the last two elements.
     - Checks if the GCD of the last two elements is greater than the bitwise AND plus `x`. If so, it marks "YES" and selects the last two elements as the red numbers and the rest as blue.
     - Alternatively, it checks if the GCD of all but the first two elements is greater than the bitwise AND of the first two elements plus `x`. If so, it marks "YES" and selects the first two elements as the red numbers and the rest as blue.
     - If neither condition is met, it marks "NO".

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program correctly handles the sorting and computation of GCD and bitwise AND.
   - The logic for selecting the red and blue numbers is sound.
   - The conditions for Kirill to win are checked correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles empty lists by returning 0 as the GCD, which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The program correctly processes the bitwise AND and GCD calculations.
   - The program correctly identifies when Kirill can win based on the given conditions.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the results in the specified format, which includes "YES" or "NO" followed by the selected numbers for red and blue sets.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the rules and conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided logic.
