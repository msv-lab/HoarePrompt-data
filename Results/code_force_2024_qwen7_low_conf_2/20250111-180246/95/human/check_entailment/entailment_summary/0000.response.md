Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining whether Kirill can choose two numbers from the array such that the GCD of these two numbers is strictly greater than the bitwise AND of the remaining numbers plus a constant \(x\).
2. **Execution Summary of Function `func_1`**: This function computes the GCD of a list of integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correctly implemented and used in the main logic.
3. **Execution Summary of Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads input data and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it sorts the array \(a\).
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. If the GCD of the last two largest numbers is greater than the bitwise AND of the rest plus \(x\).
     2. If the GCD of the first \(n-2\) numbers is greater than the bitwise AND of the first two numbers plus \(x\).
   - If either condition is met, it outputs 'YES' along with the chosen numbers and the remaining numbers.
   - If neither condition is met, it outputs 'NO'.

Given the logic described, the function correctly implements the game rules and checks all necessary conditions. Therefore, the provided code meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
