You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the evenings during the hike, Kirill and Anton decided to take out an array
of integers a of length n from their backpack and play a game with it. The
rules are as follows:

  1. Kirill chooses from 2 to (n-2) numbers and encircles them in red.
  2. Anton encircles all the remaining numbers in blue.
  3. Kirill calculates the greatest common divisor ([GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)) of all the red numbers.
  4. Anton calculates the [bitwise AND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND) of all the blue numbers and adds the number x to the result.
  5. If the GCD of all the red numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the bitwise AND of all the blue numbers and the number x , then Kirill wins; otherwise, Anton wins.

Help Kirill to beat Anton or tell if it's impossible.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 20\,000 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (4\le n \le
4\cdot 10^5 , 0 \le x \le 4\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of integers and the
number x respectively.

The second line contains an array a of length n (1 \le a_i \le 4\cdot 10^5 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 4\cdot
10^5 . It is also guaranteed that the sum of the maximum values of a_i for
each test case does not exceed 4\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" on the first line if the condition can be
met, on the second line, output the number of chosen numbers by Kirill and the
numbers themselves in any order separated by a space, and on the third line,
output the size of the second set and the numbers in it.

Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is implemented using the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. However, the problem statement requires computing the GCD of all red numbers, not just two. The current implementation only computes the GCD of the last two elements in the sorted array, which is incorrect.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of all red numbers should be computed using the entire array of red numbers, not just the last two. The current implementation of `gcd1` and `gcd2` only considers the last two or a subset of the array, which is incorrect.

3. **Bitwise AND Calculation**: The bitwise AND of all blue numbers should be computed using the entire array of blue numbers, not just the first two. The current implementation of `and1` and `and2` only considers the first two elements, which is incorrect.

Here is an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
4 1
4 3 1 8
```
- Red numbers: `4, 8`
- Blue numbers: `3`

Expected output:
```
YES
2 4 8
1 3
```

However, the current program outputs:
```
YES
2 8 4
2 3 1
```

This is incorrect because the GCD of `4` and `8` is `4`, and the bitwise AND of `3` is `3`. Since `4` is not greater than `3 + 1`, the output should be `NO`.

To fix these issues, the GCD calculation should consider all red numbers, and the bitwise AND calculation should consider all blue numbers. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from functools import reduce

# Function to compute GCD of all elements in the array
def gcd_all(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x if y == 0 else gcd_all([x // y, y]), arr, arr[0])

# Function to compute bitwise AND of all elements in the array
def bit_and_all(arr):
    return reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, arr)

def func_2():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        x = int(sys.stdin.readline())
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        a.sort()

        # Calculate GCD of the last two elements as a worst-case scenario
        gcd_red = gcd_all(a[-2:]) if len(a) > 2 else 0

        # Calculate bitwise AND of all but the last two elements as a worst-case scenario
        and_blue = bit_and_all(a[:-2]) if len(a) > 2 else 0

        if gcd_red > and_blue + x:
            results.append('YES')
            results.append(f'2 {a[-1]} {a[-2]}')
            results.append(f'{n - 2} ' + ' '.join(map(str, a[:-2])))
        else:
            results.append('NO')

    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the GCD is computed for all red numbers and the bitwise AND is computed for all blue numbers, adhering to the problem description.
