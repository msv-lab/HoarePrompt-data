Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of GCD:**
   - The program uses the `func_1` function to calculate the GCD of the last two elements in the sorted list `a`. However, the problem description requires calculating the GCD of the chosen numbers by Kirill, which are supposed to be chosen between 2 to (n-2).
   - The GCD calculation should involve these specific chosen numbers, not just the last two elements of the sorted list.

2. **Incorrect Bitwise AND Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the bitwise AND of all elements except the first two elements using `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[:-2])`. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that Anton should encircle all remaining numbers (which would be `a[2:]` after choosing two numbers).
   - The correct bitwise AND calculation should be `reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, a[2:])`.

3. **Logic for Choosing Numbers:**
   - The logic in the `func_2` function does not correctly choose the numbers that Kirill encircles. It currently sorts the list and tries to find two numbers to encircle, but this approach might not always yield the correct solution.
   - The program should select any two numbers between 2 to (n-2) and ensure the GCD of these two numbers is greater than the bitwise AND of the remaining numbers plus `x`.

### Corrected Program Outline:

Here is a corrected outline of how the program should be structured:

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - Calculate the GCD of the chosen two numbers (between 2 to n-2).

2. **Bitwise AND Calculation:**
   - Calculate the bitwise AND of the remaining numbers.

3. **Check Conditions:**
   - Check if the GCD of the chosen numbers is greater than the bitwise AND of the remaining numbers plus `x`.

4. **Output Result:**
   - If the condition is met, output "YES" along with the chosen numbers and the remaining numbers.
   - If not, output "NO".

### Example of a Corrected Approach:

```python
import sys
from functools import reduce
from math import gcd

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_2():
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        
        # Try different combinations of choosing 2 numbers
        for i in range(2, n - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                chosen_red = [a[i], a[j]]
                remaining_blue = a[:i] + a[j+1:]
                
                gcd_red = gcd(chosen_red[0], chosen_red[1])
                and_blue = reduce(lambda x, y: x & y, remaining_blue)
                
                if gcd_red > and_blue + x:
                    results.append('YES')
                    results.append(f'2 {" ".join(map(str, chosen_red))}')
                    results.append(f'{len(remaining_blue)} {" ".join(map(str, remaining_blue))}')
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

func_2()
```

In this corrected approach, the program iterates over all possible pairs of numbers between 2 to (n-2), calculates the GCD and bitwise AND, and checks the condition as specified in the problem description. This ensures the program correctly implements the game rules and outputs the correct result.
