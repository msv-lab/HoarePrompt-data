The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the list `a`. After executing the loop, `a` contains the GCD of the original elements in the list, and `b` is set to 0. The function then returns the value of `a`, which is the GCD of the list elements. This process handles the case where the list `a` can contain any number of integers, including the case where the list is empty. If the list is empty, the function will return 0 as the GCD, since the GCD of an empty set of numbers is defined to be 0.
