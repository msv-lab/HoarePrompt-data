Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, and `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`. If `cell == '.B'`, `bludger` is set to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, if `cell != '..'`, `players[cell]` is updated to a dictionary with keys `'pos'` and `'has_quaffle'` set to `(i, j)` and `False`, respectively. No changes occur if `cell == '..'`.***
