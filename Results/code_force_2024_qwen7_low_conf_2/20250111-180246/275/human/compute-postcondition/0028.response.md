Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`. If `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), `goals[cell]` contains at least one element which is a tuple (0, j). Otherwise, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'). If `cell` is equal to '.Q', `quaffle` is (0, 0). If `cell` is equal to '.B', `bludger` is (0, j). If `cell` is neither '.Q' nor '.B', `cell` is either '..' or not equal to '..', and `players[cell]` is updated to {'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False} based on the condition `cell != '..'`.***
