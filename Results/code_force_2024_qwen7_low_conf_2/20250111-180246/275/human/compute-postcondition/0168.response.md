Postcondition: **`goals` is a non-empty list, `action` is the result of `action[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0, `command` is 'T', `entity` is in `players`, `x` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][0]`, `y` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][1]`, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is False, `quaffle` is (x, y), `quaffle` is in the `goals[goal_type]`. If `entity[0]` is 'R', then `red_score` is increased by 1 and the events list contains the string '0 RED GOAL'. If `entity[0]` is 'B', then `blue_score` is increased by 1 and the events list contains the string '0 BLUE GOAL'.**
