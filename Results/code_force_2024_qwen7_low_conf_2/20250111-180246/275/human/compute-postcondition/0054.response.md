`goals[cell].append((i, j))` adds the tuple `(i, j)` to the list associated with the key `cell` in the dictionary `goals`. Since `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', the key `cell` in `goals` will have its corresponding list updated. The values of `i` and `j` are 1 and 0 respectively, so the tuple `(1, 0)` will be appended to the list of tuples for either 'RG' or 'BG'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples with an additional tuple `(1, 0)` indicating the new position, `quaffle` is a tuple (i, j) representing the position of the quaffle if present, `bludger` is a tuple (i, j) representing the position of the bludger if present, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 0; `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(i, j)` in the `field` which is either 'RG' or 'BG'.**
