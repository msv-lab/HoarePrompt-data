The code `cell = field[i][j]` assigns the value of `field[i][j]` to the variable `cell`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `field` or the value of `i`. Since `j` is initially 0, the code attempts to access the element in the `field` list at index `i` and column `j`. The variable `j` is updated to hold this value, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`j` is the value of `field[i][0]`, `M` is a positive integer**
