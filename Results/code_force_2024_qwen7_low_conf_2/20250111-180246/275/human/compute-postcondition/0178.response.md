Postcondition: ***`goals` is a non-empty list (with at least one element left), `action` is the result of `action[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0, `command` is 'T', `entity` is in `players`, `x` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][0]`, `y` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][1]`, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is False, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`. If `entity[0] == 'R'`, `red_score` is incremented by 1 and `events` contains the string `'0 RED GOAL'`. If `entity[0] == 'B'`, `blue_score` is incremented by 1 and `events` contains the string `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'`.***
