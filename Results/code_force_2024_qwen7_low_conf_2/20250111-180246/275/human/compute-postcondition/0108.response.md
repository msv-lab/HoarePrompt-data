`cell` is assigned the value of `field[i][j]`. The value of `j` is updated to `j + 1` due to the initial state. The condition that `M` must be greater than `j + 1` remains valid since `j` is now `j + 1`, but the exact value of `M` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact relationship to `j + 1`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` must be greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`**
