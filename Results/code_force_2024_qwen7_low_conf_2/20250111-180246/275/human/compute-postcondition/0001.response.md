`input` is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire standard input and assigns it to `input`. The code then splits the content of `input` by newline characters (`\n`) and assigns the resulting list to `data`. The original value of `input` is updated to the read content, and `data` is created based on the split operation.

Output State: **`input` is the content read from `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` by newline characters**
