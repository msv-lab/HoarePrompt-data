Postcondition: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[quaffle]` now includes an additional tuple `(1, 0)`, `quaffle` is `(1, 0)`, `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', otherwise it remains unchanged, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 1, `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 0)` in the field. If the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', `bludger` is set to `(1, 0)`. If the cell at position `(1, 0)` is not '.B' and is not 'RG', 'BG', 'B', or '.Q', the cell remains unchanged. If the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.Q', `quaffle` is `(1, 1)` and `players['quaffle']` is set to `{'pos': (1, 0), 'has_quaffle': False}`.**
