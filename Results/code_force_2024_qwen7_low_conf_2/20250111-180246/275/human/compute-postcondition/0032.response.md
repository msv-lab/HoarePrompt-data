The code assigns the value of \(i, j\) to the variable `quaffle`. Given the initial state, \(j\) is 1 and \(i\) is 0. Therefore, `quaffle` is updated to \((0, 1)\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **\(j\) is 1, \(i\) is 0, \(M\) is greater than 0, \(cell\) is the value of \(field[0][1]\), if \(cell\) is in ('RG', 'BG'): `goals[cell]` contains at least one element which is a tuple (0, 1), otherwise \(cell\) is not in ('RG', 'BG'), if \(cell\) is equal to '.Q': `quaffle` is (0, 1), if \(cell\) is equal to '.B': `bludger` is (0, 1), if \(cell\) is neither '.Q' nor '.B': \(cell\) is either '..' or not equal to '..', `players[cell]` is updated to {'pos': (0, 1), 'has_quaffle': False} based on the condition `cell != '..'`.**
