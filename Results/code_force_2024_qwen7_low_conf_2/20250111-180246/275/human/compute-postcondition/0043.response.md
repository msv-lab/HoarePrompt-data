`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `i` and `j` are 0 and 2 respectively. Therefore, `bludger` becomes `(0, 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value at `field[0][2]; bludger` is (0, 2)**
