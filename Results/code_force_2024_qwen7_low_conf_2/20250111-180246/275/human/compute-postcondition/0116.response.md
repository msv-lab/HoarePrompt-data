Postcondition: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`. If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, then `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, j)`. If `cell` is `'.Q'`, then `quaffle` is `(i, j)`. If `cell` is `'.B'`, then `bludger` is `(i, j)`. If `cell` is neither `'.Q'` nor `'.B'`, then `j` is incremented by 1, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, j)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.**
