The code `quaffle = i, j` updates the variable `quaffle` to be a tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, `quaffle` will be updated to `(1, 1)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples, `quaffle` is `(1, 1)`, `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', or remains unchanged if the cell is not '.B', `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 1; `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(i, j)` in the `field`.**
