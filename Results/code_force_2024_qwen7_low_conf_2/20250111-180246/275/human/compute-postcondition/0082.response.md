The code `bludger = i, j` updates the value of `bludger` to be a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is 1 and `j` is 2. Therefore, the new value of `bludger` will be `(1, 2)`.

Other variables remain unaffected by this piece of code. 

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 2)` in the field, `quaffle` is `(1, 0)`, `bludger` is `(1, 2)`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 2.**
