The variable `bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same as they were before, and the other variables (`j`, `M`, `cell`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `bludger` is (i, j)**
