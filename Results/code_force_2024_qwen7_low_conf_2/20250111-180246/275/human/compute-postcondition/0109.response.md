`goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. The value of `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, so the tuple `(i, j)` is added to the list `goals[cell]`. The values of `j`, `M`, and `cell` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, j)`**
