`bludger` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. The values of `i` and `j` are used directly in the assignment. The variables `j` and `M` remain unaffected, and `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`. The only change is the creation of the variable `bludger`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` must be greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `bludger` is `(i, j)`**
