Postcondition: **`j` is the value of `field[i][0]`, `M` is a positive integer, and the cell is not in ('RG', 'BG'), and the cell is not '.Q'. If the current value of `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is (i, j). Otherwise, if the current value of `cell` is not '..', `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is equal to (i, `field[i][0]`) and 'has_quaffle' is False.**
