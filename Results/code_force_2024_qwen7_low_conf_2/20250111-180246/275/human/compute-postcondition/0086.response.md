Postcondition: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 2)` in the field, `quaffle` is `(1, 2)`, `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', otherwise it remains unchanged, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and the entry for `cell` is now {'pos': (1, 2), 'has_quaffle': True} if the cell at position `(1, 2)` is '.Q', otherwise the entry for `cell` is {'pos': (1, 2), 'has_quaffle': False} if the cell at position `(1, 2)` is not ".Q".**
