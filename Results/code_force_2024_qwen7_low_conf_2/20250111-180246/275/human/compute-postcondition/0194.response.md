Postcondition: **`action` is the result of `action[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1 depending on the execution of the condition, `T` is greater than 0, `command` is 'T', `entity` is in `players`, `x` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][0]`, `y` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][1]`, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` remains unchanged, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `red_score` is the total number of 'RG' goals scored by the red team, `blue_score` is the total number of 'BG' goals scored by the blue team, and `events` is a list containing strings corresponding to each goal scored during the loop iterations. If `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is True before the condition, it remains True; otherwise, it remains False.**
