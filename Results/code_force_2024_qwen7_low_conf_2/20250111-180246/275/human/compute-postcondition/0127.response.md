Output State: **`j` is equal to `M`, `M` is a positive integer, `cell` is the value of `field[i][M-1]`, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples indicating the positions of cells with those values, `quaffle` is a tuple (i, j) if there was a '.Q' cell, otherwise it is still `(i, j)` from the initial state, `bludger` is a tuple (i, j) if there was a '.B' cell, otherwise it is still `(i, j)` from the initial state, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is False, and `cell` contains the position of the last cell checked, which is `(i, M-1)`**.
