Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples indicating the positions of cells with those values, `quaffle` is `(1, 0)` or remains unchanged, `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(i, j)` is `.B`, or remains unchanged if the cell is not `.B`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 0; the value of the cell at position `(i, j)` in the `field` is not 'RG', 'BG', 'B', or '.Q'.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
