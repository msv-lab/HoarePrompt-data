Postcondition: ***`goals` is a non-empty list (with at least one element left), `action` is the result of `action[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0, `command` is 'T', `entity` is in `players`, `x` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][0]`, `y` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][1]`, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is False, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `goal_type` is the next element in `goals`. Additionally, if `entity[0] == 'R'`, then `red_score` is increased by 1 and `events` contains the string 't RED GOAL' where t is either 0 or 1. Otherwise, `blue_score` is increased by 1 and `events` contains the string '1 BLUE GOAL'.***
