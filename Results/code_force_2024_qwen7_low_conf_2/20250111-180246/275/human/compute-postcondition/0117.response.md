To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop structure.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is `j + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `M` is greater than `j + 1`.
   - `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.
   - Depending on the value of `cell`, different actions are taken:
     - If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, then `goals[cell]` includes the tuple `(i, j)`.
     - If `cell` is `'.Q'`, then `quaffle` is `(i, j)`.
     - If `cell` is `'.B'`, then `bludger` is `(i, j)`.
     - If `cell` is neither `'.Q'` nor `'.B'`, then `j` is incremented by 1, and `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys `'pos': (i, j)` and `'has_quaffle': False`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j < M`.

3. **Current Values at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `j + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `M` is still greater than `j + 1` (since `j` was incremented).
   - `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `M`.
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to check if `j + 1 < M`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than `M - 1`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `j` should be incremented to `j + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `cell` will be checked again with the new value of `j`.
   - `M` remains unchanged.
   - If `cell` is in `('RG', 'BG')`, `goals[cell]` will include the tuple `(i, j + 1)`.
   - If `cell` is `'.Q'`, `quaffle` will be updated to `(i, j + 1)`.
   - If `cell` is `'.B'`, `bludger` will be updated to `(i, j + 1)`.
   - If `cell` is neither `'.Q'` nor `'.B'`, `j` will be incremented again, and `players[cell]` will be updated to `{'pos': (i, j + 1), 'has_quaffle': False}`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j + 1]`.**

This ensures that the loop can continue executing the next iteration with the updated state.
