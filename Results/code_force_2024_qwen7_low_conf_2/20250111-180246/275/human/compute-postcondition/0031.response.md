The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state, we know the following:
- \( j \) is 1
- \( i \) is 0
- \( M \) is greater than 0
- \( cell \) is in ('RG', 'BG'), because if \( cell \) were not in ('RG', 'BG'), the given conditions for `goals[cell]` would not apply.
- `goals[cell]` contains at least one element which is a tuple (0, 1).
- `cell` is either '.Q', '.B', '.', '..'

Since `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), and `goals[cell]` already contains at least one tuple (0, 1), appending `(i, j)` (which is (0, 1)) will not change the fact that `goals[cell]` contains at least one tuple (0, 1). 

Therefore, the updated value of `goals[cell]` will include the existing tuples plus the new tuple (0, 1).

Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), `goals[cell]` contains at least one tuple (0, 1) and now also includes the tuple (0, 1)**
