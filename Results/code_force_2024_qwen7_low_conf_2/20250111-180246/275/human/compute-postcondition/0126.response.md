Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`. If `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[cell]` contains an additional element `(i, j)`. If `cell` is '.Q', no additional variables are changed. If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is set to `(i, j)`. If `cell` is not '.', `players[cell]` is updated to a dictionary with keys `'pos'` and `'has_quaffle'` set to `(i, j)` and `False`, respectively. If `cell` is '..', no changes occur.***
