According to the given code, the loop iterates over the range defined by `M`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `j` is the value of `field[i][0]`
- `M` is a positive integer

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`. The value of `M` must still be greater than `j + 1` for the loop to continue.

Let's break down the states:
1. The variable `j` will be incremented by 1.
2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j + 1` must be less than `M`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j + 1`.
- `M` must still be greater than `j + 1`.

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` must be greater than `j + 1`**
