The variable `bludger` is assigned the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state, but they are used to set the position of `bludger`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, and `cell` is not equal to '.Q', `bludger` is (0, j).

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'), `cell` is the value of `field[0][j]`, and `cell` is not equal to '.Q', `bludger` is (0, j)**
