Postcondition: **`action` is `actions[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0, `entity` is in `players`, `players[entity]['pos']` is updated to `(x, y)`, the current coordinates of the entity are equal to `bludger`, `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` remains unchanged unless the command is 'C' and `(x, y)` equals `quaffle`, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `red_score` is the total number of 'RG' goals scored by the red team, `blue_score` is the total number of 'BG' goals scored by the blue team, and `events` is a list containing strings corresponding to each goal scored during the loop iterations.**
