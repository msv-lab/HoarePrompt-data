The code appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG'. However, the value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value after the operation. The initial state also specifies that `N` must be greater than 0 and `M` must be greater than 0, but these conditions do not affect the variables directly involved in the operation.

After executing the line of code, the tuple `(0, j)` is appended to `goals[cell]`. Since `i` is 0 and `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG', the updated state for `goals` will be:

- `goals['RG']` (or `goals['BG']`) will contain at least one element which is a tuple `(0, j)`, where `j` was not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 0; `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'); `goals[cell]` contains at least one element which is a tuple (0, j)**
