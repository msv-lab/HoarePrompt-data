Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 2)` in the field, `quaffle` is `(1, 0)`, `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', otherwise it remains unchanged, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle. If the cell at position `(1, 2)` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[RG]` or `goals[BG]` now contains the tuple `(1, 2)`. Otherwise, the entry for `cell` in the `players` dictionary is updated to reflect whether the cell is '.Q' or not, i.e., `{'pos': (1, 2), 'has_quaffle': True}` if the cell at position `(1, 2)` is '.Q', and `{'pos': (1, 2), 'has_quaffle': False}` if the cell at position `(1, 2)` is not '.Q'.***
