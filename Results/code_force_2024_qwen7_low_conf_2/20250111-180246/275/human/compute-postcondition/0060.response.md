The code `bludger = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `bludger`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, the new value of `bludger` is `(1, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples indicating the positions of cells with those values, `quaffle` is a tuple (i, j) representing the position of the quaffle if present, `bludger` is now `(1, 0)`, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 0; `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(i, j)` in the `field`. The cell at position `(i, j)` is 'BL' since the if condition checks if `cell == '.B'`.**
