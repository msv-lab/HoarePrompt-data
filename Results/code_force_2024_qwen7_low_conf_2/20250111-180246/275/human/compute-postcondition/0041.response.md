The code `goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. Given the initial state:
- `j` is 2
- `i` is 0
- `M` is greater than 0
- `cell` is the value at `field[0][2]`

Since the code does not modify the values of `j`, `i`, or `M`, these remain unchanged. However, `goals[cell]` is updated by appending `(0, 2)` to it.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value at `field[0][2]`; `goals[cell]` contains the element `(0, 2)`**
