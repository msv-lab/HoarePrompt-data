Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable `t` will be incremented from 0 to `T-1`.
   - The loop will iterate as long as `t` is less than `T`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `N` is a positive integer.
   - `M` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `N - 1`.
   - `j` is `M - 1`.
   - `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples indicating the positions of cells with those values.
   - `quaffle` is a tuple (i, j) if there was a '.Q' cell, otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `bludger` is a tuple (i, j) if there was a '.B' cell, otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is False.
   - `cell` is the last value encountered in the last iteration of the loop.
   - `red_score` is 0.
   - `blue_score` is 0.
   - `events` is an empty list.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `t < T`.

### Required Adjustments:
- The initial value of `t` should be set to 0.
- The loop will run for `T` iterations, so `t` must be less than `T` after each iteration.

### Final State:
Given the above analysis, we need to adjust the following states:
- `t` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
- `t` must be less than `T` after each iteration for the loop to continue.

### State After Adjustments:
State: **`t` is 0, `T` must be greater than 0**
