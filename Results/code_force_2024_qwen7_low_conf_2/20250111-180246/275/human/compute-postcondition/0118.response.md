`cell` is assigned the value of `field[i][j]`. The previous value of `cell` was `field[i][j + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`**
