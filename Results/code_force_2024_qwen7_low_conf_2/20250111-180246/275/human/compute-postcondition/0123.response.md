Postcondition: ***`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; if `cell != '..'`, then `players[cell]` is updated to a dictionary with keys `'pos'` and `'has_quaffle'` set to `(i, j)` and `False`, respectively. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if `cell == '..'`.***
