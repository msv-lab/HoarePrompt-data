Postcondition: **`action` is `actions[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0, `entity` is in `players`, `x` and `y` are the coordinates of `entity` in `players[entity]['pos']`, and if `command` is 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', then the command is one of these four directions, and if `command` is 'U', `y` is decremented by 1, if `command` is 'D', `y` is incremented by 1, if `command` is 'L', `y` is decremented by 1, if `command` is 'R', `y` is incremented by 1, if `command` is 'C', then `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is `True` if `(x, y)` equals `quaffle`, otherwise `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` remains unchanged, `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `red_score` is the total number of 'RG' goals scored by the red team, `blue_score` is the total number of 'BG' goals scored by the blue team, and `events` is a list containing strings corresponding to each goal scored during the loop iterations.**
