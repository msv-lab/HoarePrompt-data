The code `goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. The values of `i` and `j` are taken from the initial state, where `j` is the value of `field[i][0]`, and `cell` is either 'RG' or 'BG'. The states of the other variables (`M`, `field`, and `goals`) are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is the value of `field[i][0]`, `M` is a positive integer, `goals['RG']` includes a new element (i, j) or `goals['BG']` includes a new element (i, j)**
