The code `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value `1000000007` to the variable `MOD`. This does not affect the values of `input` or `data`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`input` is the content read from `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `input` by newline characters, `MOD` is 1000000007**
