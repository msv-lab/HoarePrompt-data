`quaffle` is assigned the tuple `(i, j)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, `quaffle` will be `(0, 2)`. The values of `j`, `i`, `M`, and `cell` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 2, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value at `field[0][2]`; `quaffle` is `(0, 2)`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0; `cell` is the value at `field[0][2]`; `quaffle` is `(0, 2)`**
