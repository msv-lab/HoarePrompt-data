Postcondition: ***`action` is `actions[0].split()`, `entity` is the first element of `action[0].split()`, `t` is either 0 or 1, `T` is greater than 0, `command` is 'C' if the condition `command == 'C'` is true, otherwise `command` is 'T'. `entity` is in `players`, `x` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][0]`, `y` is the value of `players[entity]['pos'][1]`. `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` is `True` if `(x, y)` equals `quaffle` and `command` is 'C', otherwise `players[entity]['has_quaffle']` remains unchanged. `quaffle` is `(N // 2, M // 2)`, `red_score` is the total number of 'RG' goals scored by the red team, `blue_score` is the total number of 'BG' goals scored by the blue team, and `events` is a list containing strings corresponding to each goal scored during the loop iterations.***
