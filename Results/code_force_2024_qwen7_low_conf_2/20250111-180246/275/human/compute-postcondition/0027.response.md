Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is not in ('RG', 'BG'). If `cell` is equal to '.Q', then `quaffle` is (0, 0). Otherwise, `cell` is not equal to '.Q'. If `cell` is equal to '.B', then `bludger` is (0, j). If `cell` is neither '.Q' nor '.B', then `cell` is either '..' or not equal to '..', and `players[cell]` is updated to {'pos': (0, j), 'has_quaffle': False} based on the condition `cell != '..'`.***
