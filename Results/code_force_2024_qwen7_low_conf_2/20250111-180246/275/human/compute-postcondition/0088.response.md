Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `i` is `N`, `j` is `M`, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples indicating the positions of cells with those values, `quaffle` is a tuple (i, j) representing the position of the quaffle if present, `bludger` is a tuple (i, j) representing the position of the bludger if present, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `cell` is the last value encountered in the last iteration of the loop. After executing the loop, the entire field has been traversed, and the following conditions hold: `goals['RG']` contains all positions of 'RG' cells in the field, `goals['BG']` contains all positions of 'BG' cells in the field, `quaffle` contains the position of the quaffle if it was found, `bludger` contains the position of the bludger if it was found, `players` contains the positions and quaffle status of all players who have interacted with the field, and `cell` contains the position of the last cell checked.**
