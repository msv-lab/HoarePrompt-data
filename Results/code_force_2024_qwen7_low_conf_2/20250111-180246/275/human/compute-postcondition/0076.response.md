Postcondition: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `goals` is a dictionary where each key is either 'RG' or 'BG', and each value is a list of tuples. `quaffle` is `(1, 1)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.Q', otherwise it is `(1, 0)` or remains unchanged. `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', or remains unchanged if the cell is not '.B'. `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `j` is 1; `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 0)` in the field. If the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', `bludger` is set to `(1, 0)`. If the cell at position `(1, 0)` is not '.B' and is not 'RG', 'BG', 'B', or '.Q', the cell remains unchanged. If the cell at position `(1, 0)` is not "..", `players[cell]` is set to `{'pos': (1, 0), 'has_quaffle': False}`.**
