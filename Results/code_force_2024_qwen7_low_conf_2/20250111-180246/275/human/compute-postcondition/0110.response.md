The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle`. This does not change the values of `j`, `M`, or `cell`. Therefore, the value of `j` remains `j + 1`, `M` must still be greater than `j + 1`, and `cell` retains its value as `field[i][j]`.

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` must be greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`; `quaffle` is `(i, j)`**
