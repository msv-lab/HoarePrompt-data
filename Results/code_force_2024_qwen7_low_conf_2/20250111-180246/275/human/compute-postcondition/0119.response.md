The code `goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `cell`, `i`, or `j`. The only specific values given are that `M` is greater than `j + 1`, and `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`.

Since no specific values are given for `cell`, `i`, or `j`, the only specific change is the addition of a tuple to the list `goals[cell]`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `M` is greater than `j + 1`, `cell` is the value of `field[i][j]`, `goals[cell]` contains an additional element `(i, j)`**
