Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0. If `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), `goals[cell]` contains at least one tuple (0, 1). If `cell` is '.Q', `quaffle` is (0, 1). If `cell` is '.B', `bludger` is (0, 1). If `cell` is neither '.Q' nor '.B', `players[cell]` is updated to `{'pos': (0, 1), 'has_quaffle': False}` based on the condition `cell != '..'`. If `cell` is '.', no changes are made to `players[cell]`. Otherwise, if `cell` is in ('RG', 'BG'), `goals[cell]` contains at least one tuple (0, 1) and now also includes the tuple (0, 1).***
