The code `goals[cell].append((i, j))` appends a tuple `(i, j)` to the list `goals[cell]`. From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 2
- `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 2)` in the field.

Therefore, the tuple `(1, 2)` is appended to the list `goals[cell]`.

The output state is:
- `N` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `M` must be greater than 0
- `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 2)` in the field
- `quaffle` is `(1, 0)`
- `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', otherwise it remains unchanged
- `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle
- `goals[cell]` now contains the tuple `(1, 2)` (if it was empty before)

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `cell` is the value of the cell at position `(1, 2)` in the field, `quaffle` is `(1, 0)`, `bludger` is at position `(1, 0)` if the cell at position `(1, 0)` is '.B', otherwise it remains unchanged, `players` is a dictionary where each key is a player identifier (except '.', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'), and each value is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is a tuple (i, j) indicating the player's position and 'has_quaffle' is a boolean indicating whether the player has the quaffle, and `goals[cell]` now contains the tuple `(1, 2)`**
