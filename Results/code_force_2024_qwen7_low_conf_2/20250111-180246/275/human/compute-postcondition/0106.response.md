Postcondition: **`j` is the value of `field[i][0]`, `M` is a positive integer. If the cell is in ('RG', 'BG'), then either `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` includes a new element (i, j). Otherwise, if the cell is '.Q', the state remains unchanged. If the cell is '.', then `quaffle` is set to (i, j). If the cell is '.B', then `bludger` is set to (i, j). If the cell is neither '.' nor '..', then `players[cell]` is a dictionary with keys 'pos' and 'has_quaffle', where 'pos' is equal to (i, field[i][0]) and 'has_quaffle' is False.**
