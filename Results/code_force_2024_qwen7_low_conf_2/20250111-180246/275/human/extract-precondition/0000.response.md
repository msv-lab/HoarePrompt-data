Precondition: **The function takes no input parameters. However, the precondition for the problem it aims to solve is as follows:**
**N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N, M are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string is a row of the field consisting of M characters. The field contains goals, players, a Quaffle, and possibly a Bludger as described in the problem statement. The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.**
