The function `func` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9). It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a value `tents` based on the following rules:
1. Initialize `tents` with the value of `a`.
2. Add to `tents` one-third of `b` rounded down if `b` is divisible by 3.
3. If `b` leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 and there are at least 2 universals (`c`), add one-third of `b` rounded down plus 1 to `tents` and reduce `c` by 2. If there are fewer than 2 universals, print `-1` and skip to the next iteration.
4. If `b` leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and there is at least 1 universal (`c`), add one-third of `b` rounded down plus 1 to `tents` and reduce `c` by 1. If there are no universals, print `-1` and skip to the next iteration.
5. Add to `tents` one-third of `c` rounded down plus 1 if `c` has a remainder when divided by 3. Finally, print the value of `tents` if it is valid, otherwise print `-1`.

After processing all test cases, the function prints `-1` for any test case where the conditions cannot be met. The final state of the program after the function concludes includes:
- `t`: the total number of test cases processed.
- `a`, `b`, and `c`: the last values of the respective input parameters.
- `tents`: the computed value based on the above rules, or `-1` if any condition fails to be met.
