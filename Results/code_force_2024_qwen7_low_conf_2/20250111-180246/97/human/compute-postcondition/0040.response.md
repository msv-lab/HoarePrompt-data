The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not change any variables and simply ends the current operation without affecting the state of any variables.

The initial state remains unchanged, and the print statement outputs `-1` which is already part of the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print statement outputs `-1`.**
