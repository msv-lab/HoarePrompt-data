Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input. If `b % 3 == 0`, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3`. Otherwise, `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1` if `c` is either 1 or 2, and `tents` remains unchanged if `c` is 0. Additionally, if `c` is 1 or 2, `c` is decremented accordingly, and `-1` is printed if `c` becomes 0.***
