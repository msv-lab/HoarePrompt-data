The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables and instead moves to the next iteration of a loop (if there is one). Since no loop was specified in the initial state or code, the impact of `continue` is considered to be outside of any loop context, and thus no changes to the variables occur.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `tents` is equal to `a`, the value `-1` is printed to the console.**
