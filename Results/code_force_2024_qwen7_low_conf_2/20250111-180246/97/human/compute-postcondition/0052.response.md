The code `print(-1)` does not affect any of the variables and simply prints `-1`. The only impact is the output of `-1` to the console. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `tents` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `tents` is equal to `a` initially, and the output is -1.**
