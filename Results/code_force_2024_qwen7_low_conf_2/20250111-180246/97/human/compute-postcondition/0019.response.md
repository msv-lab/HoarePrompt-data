`c` is decremented by 1. Since `c` was initially greater than or equal to 1, it is now equal to `c - 1`. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, and `tents`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are still valid.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`, the current value of `b` is divisible by 3 and leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and `c` is equal to `c - 1`**
