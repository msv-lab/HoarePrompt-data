`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`. The code `tents += b // 3` means that the value of `tents` is updated by adding the integer division of `b` by 3 to its current value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Let's denote the integer division of `b` by 3 as `b // 3`.

Therefore, the new value of `tents` will be `a + (b // 3)`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3)`**
