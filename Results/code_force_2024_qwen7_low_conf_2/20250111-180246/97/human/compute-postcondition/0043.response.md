`c` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, and the values of `a` and `b` remain as integer inputs. The expression for `tents` is unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is `c - 1`; `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3) + 1`.**
