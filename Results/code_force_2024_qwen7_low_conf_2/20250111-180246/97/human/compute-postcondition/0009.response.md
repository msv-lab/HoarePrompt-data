`tents` is initially equal to `a`. The code `tents += b // 3 + 1` increments `tents` by the value of `b // 3 + 1`. Since `b % 3` equals 1, `b // 3` is an integer division of `b` by 3, which means it is the integer part of `b / 3`. Adding 1 to this value results in `tents` being incremented by the integer part of `b / 3` plus 1. 

Therefore, the new value of `tents` is `a + (b // 3 + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3 + 1)`**
