`c` is decremented by 2. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The expression for `tents` does not depend on `c`, so it remains `a + b // 3 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is `c - 2`, `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`**
