Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and \(10^9\), `b` is an integer between 0 and \(10^9\), `c` is an integer between 0 and \(10^9\). Depending on the value of `b % 3` and the condition on `c`, `tents` is either `a + b // 3`, `a + (b // 3 + 1)`, `a + b // 3 + 1`, or `a`. If `c < 2` and `b % 3 == 0`, then `tents` is set to `a + b // 3` and -1 is printed. If `c < 2` and `b % 3 == 1`, then `tents` is set to `a` and -1 is printed. If `c >= 2` and `b % 3 == 1`, then `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3 + 1)`. If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, then `tents` is set to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tents` is set to `a` and -1 is printed.***
