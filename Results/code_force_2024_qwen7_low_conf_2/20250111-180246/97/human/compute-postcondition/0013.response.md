The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current loop's body and proceed with the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not change the state of any variables. The only thing that happens is that the loop or block of code following this statement would be skipped if it were part of a loop. Given that no such loop exists, the variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and satisfies `b % 3 == 1`, `c` is an integer less than 2, `tents` equals `a`, the print statement outputs `-1`.**
