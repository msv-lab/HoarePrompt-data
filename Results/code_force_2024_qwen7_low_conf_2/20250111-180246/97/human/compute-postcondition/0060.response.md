The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. It does not affect any of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `tents`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `tents` is equal to `a`, print statement outputs -1**
