Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, and `tents` equals `a` initially. If `c` is greater than or equal to 1, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tents` remains unchanged and `-1` is printed to the console.***
