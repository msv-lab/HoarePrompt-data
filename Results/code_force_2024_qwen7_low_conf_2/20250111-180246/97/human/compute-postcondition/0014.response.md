Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9 and satisfies `b % 3 == 1`, `c` is an integer, `tents` equals either `a + (b // 3 + 1)` if `c >= 2` or remains `a` if `c < 2`. Additionally, if `c < 2`, the print statement outputs `-1`.***
