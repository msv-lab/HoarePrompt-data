`tents` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t` and `b` and `c` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the given code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`.**
