State before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Variable `t`:**
   - The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will execute.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we only need to ensure that `t` is positive.

2. **Variables `a`, `b`, and `c`:**
   - These variables are not directly involved in the loop condition but could be used within the loop body.
   - Their values (non-negative integers between 0 and \(10^9\)) do not affect the loop's execution itself but could be modified during each iteration of the loop.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ b ≤ 10^9, `c` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ c ≤ 10^9**
