The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop specified, the `continue` statement does not affect any variable values or the overall state. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9; `tents` is equal to `a`, the current value of `b` is divisible by 3 and leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, `c` is less than 1; printed value is -1**
