The code prints `-1`, which does not affect any variable values but does affect the output. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`; print statement outputs `-1`.**
