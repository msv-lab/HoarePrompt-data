`tents` is initially equal to `a`. The code adds `b // 3` to `tents`. Since `b % 3 == 0`, `b` is divisible by 3, and `b // 3` will be an integer. Let's denote `b // 3` as `k`, where `k` is an integer. Therefore, `tents` becomes `a + k`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3`.**
