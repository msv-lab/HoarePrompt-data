`c` is decremented by 2. The value of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `tents` remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is `c - 2`; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is `c - 2`; `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`.**
