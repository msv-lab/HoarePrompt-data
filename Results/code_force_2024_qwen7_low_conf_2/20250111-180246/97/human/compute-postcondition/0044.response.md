The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `tents`. Therefore, the only change is the printed value.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`; printed value is -1**
