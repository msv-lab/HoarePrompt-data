The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\). 

Case_1: `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers within the range \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\). The function returns the result of a computation or decision based on these inputs.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t` and three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and return a result based on these inputs.
