Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, and `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9. If `b % 3 == 1`, then `tents` equals either `a + (b // 3 + 1)` if `c >= 2` or remains `a` if `c < 2`. Additionally, if `c < 2`, the print statement outputs `-1`. If `b % 3 != 1`, then `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1` if `c >= 1`, the current value of `b` is divisible by 3 and leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and `c` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tents` is equal to `a`, the current value of `b` is divisible by 3 and leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, and the function prints -1.***
