Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, and `tents` is updated as follows: if `c` was originally 1 or 2, `tents` is set to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1 (if necessary); if `c` was 0, `tents` remains `a + b // 3`. Additionally, the function prints the final value of `tents` or `-1` depending on the conditions specified.**
