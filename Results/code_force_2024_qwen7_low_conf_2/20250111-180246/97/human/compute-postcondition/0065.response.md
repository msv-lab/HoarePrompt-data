The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The only change is that the value `-1` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `tents` is equal to `a`, the value `-1` is printed to the console.**
