The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and the initial conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly used in this operation, but they remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input**
