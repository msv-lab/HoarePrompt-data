The code snippet `print(-1)` prints `-1` to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is the printed value.

Output State: **-1 is printed, `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3` if `b % 3 == 0` and `c` is either 1 or 2, otherwise `tents` remains unchanged if `c` is 0. If `c` is 1 or 2, `c` is decremented accordingly.**
