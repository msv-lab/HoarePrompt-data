Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, and `tents` is equal to `a`. If `c` is greater than or equal to 1 and `b % 3 == 2`, then `tents` is updated to `a + (b // 3) + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a` and the printed value is -1.***
