The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided in the code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input; `tents` is equal to `a`; printed value is -1**
