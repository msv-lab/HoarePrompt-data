Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input. If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2. If `c` is less than 2, `tents` remains equal to `a`, the program prints -1, and then continues with the next statement (if any).***
