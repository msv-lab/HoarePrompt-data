Let's analyze the loop and derive the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\).

### Loop Code:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    tents = a
    if b % 3 == 0:
        tents += b // 3
    elif b % 3 == 1:
        if c >= 2:
            tents += b // 3 + 1
            c -= 2
        else:
            print(-1)
            continue
    elif b % 3 == 2:
        if c >= 1:
            tents += b // 3 + 1
            c -= 1
        else:
            print(-1)
            continue
    if c >= 0:
        tents += c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)
        print(tents)
    else:
        print(-1)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution and Variable Updates**:
   - For each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on user input.
   - `tents` is initially set to `a`.
   - Depending on the value of `b % 3`, `tents` is updated as follows:
     - If `b % 3 == 0`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3`.
     - If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 2.
     - If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, the program prints `-1` and exits the loop.
     - If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, `tents` is incremented by `b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
     - If `b % 3 == 2` and `c < 1`, the program prints `-1` and exits the loop.
   - After these updates, if `c` is non-negative, `tents` is further incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` and the final value of `tents` is printed. If `c` is negative, `-1` is printed.

2. **Final Values**:
   - The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer.
   - Each time, `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated based on the conditions mentioned.
   - After all iterations, the final value of `tents` will be the cumulative result of all these updates.
   - `a` remains unchanged after each iteration unless there is a new input.
   - `b` and `c` are updated based on the conditions within the loop.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- The final value of `tents` will be the sum of all increments to `a` over the `t` iterations.
- The final value of `a` will be the last value of `a` input by the user.
- `b` and `c` will be the last values of `b` and `c` input by the user.
- The final value of `tents` will be the sum of:
  - The initial value of `a`.
  - Incremented by `b // 3` for each `b % 3 == 0`.
  - Incremented by `b // 3 + 1` for each `b % 3 == 1` when `c >= 2`.
  - Incremented by `b // 3 + 1` for each `b % 3 == 2` when `c >= 1`.
  - Incremented by `c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` if `c` is non-negative after all iterations.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations (a non-negative integer), `a` is the last value of `a` input, `b` is the last value of `b` input, `c` is the last value of `c` input, and `tents` is the sum of the initial value of `a` plus the cumulative increments based on the conditions described. If the loop does not execute at all, `t` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are their original input values, and `tents` is -1 if any condition fails to meet the requirement.**
