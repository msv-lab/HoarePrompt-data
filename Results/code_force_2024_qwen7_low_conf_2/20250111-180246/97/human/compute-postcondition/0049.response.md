Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0; `a` is an integer input; `b` is an integer input; `c` is an integer input. `tents` is equal to `a` initially. After executing the if-else block, `tents` is updated as follows:
- If `b % 3 == 0`, then `tents` is set to `a + (b // 3)`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c >= 2`, then `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is updated to `c - 2`.
- If `b % 3 == 1` and `c < 2`, then the function prints `-1`.
- If `b % 3 == 2` and `c >= 1`, then `tents` is updated to `a + (b // 3) + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `tents` remains equal to `a` and the printed value is `-1`.**
