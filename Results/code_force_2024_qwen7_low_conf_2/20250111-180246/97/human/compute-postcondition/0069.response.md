Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, and `tents` is equal to `a`. If `c` is greater than or equal to 2, `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1`, `c` is decremented by 2, and no other changes occur. If `c` is 1, `tents` is updated to `a + b // 3 + 1` and `c` is decremented by 1. If `c` is 0, `tents` remains unchanged, `-1` is printed, and no further changes occur.***
