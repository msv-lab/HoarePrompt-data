`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` reads an input from the user and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain in their initial state as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9**
