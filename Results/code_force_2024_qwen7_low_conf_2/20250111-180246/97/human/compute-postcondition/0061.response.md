The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables and simply ends the current flow of the program without executing further statements. The print statement before the `continue` statement has already executed and printed -1.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input, `tents` is equal to `a`, the program prints -1 and then continues with the next statement (if any)**
