`c` is decremented by 1. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, `a` and `b` remain as integer inputs, and `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`. The Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is `c - 1`, `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer input, `b` is an integer input, `c` is `c - 1`, `tents` is equal to `a + b // 3 + 1`**
