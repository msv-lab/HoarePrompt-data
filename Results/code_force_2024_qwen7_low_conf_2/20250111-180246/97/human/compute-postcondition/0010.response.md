`c` is decremented by 2. The initial value of `c` is between 0 and 10^9. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `tents`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between -10^9 + 1 and 10^9 - 1, `tents` is equal to `a + (b // 3 + 1)`**
