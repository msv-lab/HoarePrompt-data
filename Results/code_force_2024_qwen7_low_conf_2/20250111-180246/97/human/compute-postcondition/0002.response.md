`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The values of `t` and the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 are still valid, but the exact value of `t` is not known. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers from the input, and the conditions on their ranges remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9**
