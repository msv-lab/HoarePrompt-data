`tents` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9; `tents` is equal to `a`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `c` is an integer between 0 and 10^9; `tents` is equal to `a`**
