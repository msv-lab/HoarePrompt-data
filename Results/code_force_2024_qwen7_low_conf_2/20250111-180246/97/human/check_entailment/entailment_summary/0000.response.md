Reasoning:
1. **Handling Introverts (a):**
   - The code correctly initializes `tents` with `a` because each introvert needs their own tent.

2. **Handling Extroverts (b):**
   - The code correctly handles cases where `b` (number of extroverts) is divisible by 3.
   - For `b % 3 == 1`, it checks if there are at least 2 universals (`c`). If so, it adds one more tent (since one universal can share with two extroverts). Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.
   - For `b % 3 == 2`, it checks if there is at least 1 universal. If so, it adds one more tent. Otherwise, it outputs `-1`.

3. **Handling Universals (c):**
   - The code correctly divides `c` by 3 and adds 1 if `c` has a remainder when divided by 3. This ensures that any leftover universals can be placed in a tent with one or two others.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where the conditions cannot be met by printing `-1` appropriately.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic follows the constraints and requirements provided in the problem statement. The code accounts for all possible scenarios and provides the correct number of tents or `-1` if the conditions cannot be satisfied.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
