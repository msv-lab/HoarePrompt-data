### Reasoning:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly initializes the variable `t` and reads `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Tent Calculation for Introverts**: The variable `tents` is initialized with the value of `a`, which accounts for each introvert needing a separate tent.

3. **Tent Calculation for Extroverts**:
   - If the number of extroverts `b` is divisible by 3, each group of 3 extroverts can share one tent, thus adding `b // 3` to `tents`.
   - If `b % 3 == 1`, and there are at least 2 universals available, those 2 universals can share a tent with one extrovert, and the remaining extroverts are handled similarly, adding `(b // 3) + 1` to `tents` and reducing `c` by 2. If fewer than 2 universals are available, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, and the function prints `-1`.
   - If `b % 3 == 2`, and there is at least 1 universal available, one universal can share a tent with the remaining 2 extroverts, and the rest are handled as before, adding `(b // 3) + 1` to `tents` and reducing `c` by 1. If no universals are available, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, and the function prints `-1`.

4. **Tent Calculation for Universals**:
   - After handling the extroverts, the remaining universals are distributed among the tents. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and any remaining universals (if not divisible by 3) require an additional tent, thus adding `(c // 3) + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)` to `tents`.

5. **Output and Edge Cases**:
   - If the conditions for accommodating all participants are met, the function correctly prints the total number of tents required.
   - If any condition fails to be met, the function correctly prints `-1`.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program appears to correctly implement the problem requirements.
