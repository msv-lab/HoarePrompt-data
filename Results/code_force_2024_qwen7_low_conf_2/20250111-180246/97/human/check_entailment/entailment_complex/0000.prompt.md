You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        tents = a
        
        if b % 3 == 0:
            tents += b // 3
        elif b % 3 == 1:
            if c >= 2:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 2
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        elif b % 3 == 2:
            if c >= 1:
                tents += b // 3 + 1
                c -= 1
            else:
                print(-1)
                continue
        
        if c >= 0:
            tents += c // 3 + (1 if c % 3 > 0 else 0)
            print(tents)
        else:
            print(-1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of iterations (a non-negative integer), `a` is the last value of `a` input, `b` is the last value of `b` input, `c` is the last value of `c` input, and `tents` is the sum of the initial value of `a` plus the cumulative increments based on the conditions described. If the loop does not execute at all, `t` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are their original input values, and `tents` is -1 if any condition fails to meet the requirement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9). It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a value `tents` based on the following rules:
1. Initialize `tents` with the value of `a`.
2. Add to `tents` one-third of `b` rounded down if `b` is divisible by 3.
3. If `b` leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 and there are at least 2 universals (`c`), add one-third of `b` rounded down plus 1 to `tents` and reduce `c` by 2. If there are fewer than 2 universals, print `-1` and skip to the next iteration.
4. If `b` leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 and there is at least 1 universal (`c`), add one-third of `b` rounded down plus 1 to `tents` and reduce `c` by 1. If there are no universals, print `-1` and skip to the next iteration.
5. Add to `tents` one-third of `c` rounded down plus 1 if `c` has a remainder when divided by 3. Finally, print the value of `tents` if it is valid, otherwise print `-1`.

After processing all test cases, the function prints `-1` for any test case where the conditions cannot be met. The final state of the program after the function concludes includes:
- `t`: the total number of test cases processed.
- `a`, `b`, and `c`: the last values of the respective input parameters.
- `tents`: the computed value based on the above rules, or `-1` if any condition fails to be met.
