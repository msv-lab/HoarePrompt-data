### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step against the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Check:**
   - The program reads input and splits it into `n` and the list `a`.
   - It checks if any element in `a` exceeds \(2 \times (n - 1)\), which is correct since distances can be at most \(2 \times (n - 1)\).

2. **House Position Generation:**
   - Houses are positioned in a simple grid pattern based on their indices (`x = i + 1` and `y = i % n + 1`).
   - This approach guarantees that no two houses will share the same column because `x` is incremented linearly while `y` wraps around modulo `n`.

3. **Finding Valid Visiting Sequence:**
   - For each house, the program tries to find a house that is exactly `a_i` distance away.
   - If such a house is found, it updates the `visits` list with the index of the house to visit.
   - If a valid sequence cannot be found for any house, the program prints 'NO'.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - If all houses can find a valid visiting sequence, the program prints 'YES' followed by the house coordinates and the visiting sequence.

Given the summary, the program's logic for placing houses ensures that no two houses share the same column, which satisfies the requirement. Additionally, the program attempts to find a valid visiting sequence for each house, which aligns with the problem's constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly handles the requirement that each wizard's house must be the only house in its column by generating house positions in a manner that avoids column overlap. Moreover, the program checks for the existence of valid visiting sequences, ensuring that the distance constraints are met.

Therefore, the original assessment was overly critical, and the program meets the problem requirements correctly.

### Final:
**True**
