Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the condition that each wizard's house must be the only house in its column. Specifically, the program generates house positions using a simple incrementing scheme, which does not guarantee that each wizard's house will be the only house in its column.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
4
0 4 2 4
```

The program will generate the following house positions:
- House 1 at (1, 1)
- House 2 at (2, 2)
- House 3 at (3, 3)
- House 4 at (4, 4)

This configuration does not satisfy the requirement that no two houses share the same column. For example, House 1 and House 2 both occupy the first column.

Moreover, the program does not check whether the generated positions meet the distance requirements specified in the problem statement. It simply checks if there exists any house that is exactly `a_i` distance away from another house without ensuring that each wizard's house is the only one in its column.

A correct solution would need to ensure that each wizard's house is placed such that no other wizard's house occupies the same column, and that the distance constraints are met.
