You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The only difference between this and the hard version is that all a_{i} are
even.

After some recent attacks on Hogwarts Castle by the Death Eaters, the Order of
the Phoenix has decided to station n members in Hogsmead Village. The houses
will be situated on a picturesque n\times n square field. Each wizard will
have their own house, and every house will belong to some wizard. Each house
will take up the space of one square.

However, as you might know wizards are very superstitious. During the
weekends, each wizard i will want to visit the house that is exactly a_{i} (0
\leq a_{i} \leq n) away from their own house. The roads in the village are
built horizontally and vertically, so the distance between points (x_{i},
y_{i}) and (x_{j}, y_{j}) on the n\times n field is |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} -
y_{j}| . The wizards know and trust each other, so one wizard can visit
another wizard's house when the second wizard is away. The houses to be built
will be big enough for all n wizards to simultaneously visit any house.

Apart from that, each wizard is mandated to have a view of the Hogwarts Castle
in the north and the Forbidden Forest in the south, so the house of no other
wizard should block the view. In terms of the village, it means that in each
column of the n\times n field, there can be at most one house, i.e. if the i
-th house has coordinates (x_{i}, y_{i}) , then x_{i} \neq x_{j} for all i
\neq j .

The Order of the Phoenix doesn't yet know if it is possible to place n houses
in such a way that will satisfy the visit and view requirements of all n
wizards, so they are asking for your help in designing such a plan.

If it is possible to have a correct placement, where for the i -th wizard
there is a house that is a_{i} away from it and the house of the i -th wizard
is the only house in their column, output YES, the position of houses for each
wizard, and to the house of which wizard should each wizard go during the
weekends.

If it is impossible to have a correct placement, output NO.

Input

The first line contains n (2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^{5} ), the number of houses
to be built.

The second line contains n integers a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n} (0 \leq a_{i} \leq n)
. All a_{i} are even.

Output

If there exists such a placement, output YES on the first line; otherwise,
output NO.

If the answer is YES, output n + 1 more lines describing the placement.

The next n lines should contain the positions of the houses 1 \leq x_{i},
y_{i} \leq n for each wizard.

The i -th element of the last line should contain the index of the wizard, the
house of which is exactly a_{i} away from the house of the i -th wizard. If
there are multiple such wizards, you can output any.

If there are multiple house placement configurations, you can output any.

Example

Input

    4
    0 4 2 4

Output

    YES
    4 4
    1 3
    2 4
    3 1
    1 1 1 3

Note

For the sample, the house of the 1st wizard is located at (4, 4) , of the 2nd
at (1, 3) , of the 3rd at (2, 4) , of the 4th at (3, 1) .

The distance from the house of the 1st wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |4 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 0 .

The distance from the house of the 2nd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |1 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 4 .

The distance from the house of the 3rd wizard to the house of the 1st wizard
is |2 - 4| + |4 - 4| = 2 .

The distance from the house of the 4th wizard to the house of the 3rd wizard
is |3 - 2| + |1 - 4| = 4 .

The view and the distance conditions are satisfied for all houses, so the
placement is correct.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) even integers \( a \) as input. It first checks if any element in \( a \) exceeds \( 2 \times (n - 1) \). If any element does, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it constructs a list of house coordinates based on the indices. Then, it attempts to find a valid visiting sequence for each house such that the distance between consecutive houses matches the corresponding element in \( a \). If a valid sequence can be found for all houses, it prints 'YES' followed by the house coordinates and the visiting sequence. If any house cannot be visited according to the conditions, it prints 'NO'. However, due to missing logic, the function might incorrectly print 'YES' even if not all houses can be visited correctly, as the condition check at the end only ensures the absence of -1 in visits, which is insufficient to guarantee a valid visiting sequence for all houses.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s the step-by-step verification process:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into tokens, correctly extracting `n` and the list of `a_i`.

2. **Validation of Input**: The program checks if any `a_i` value is greater than `2 * (n - 1)`. Since all `a_i` are even, if `a_i > 2 * (n - 1)`, it's impossible to find another house within that distance because the maximum Manhattan distance in an `n x n` grid is `2 * (n - 1)`. This check is necessary and correct.

3. **Placing Houses**: The program places houses in a way that ensures each house occupies a unique column (i.e., `x`-coordinates are distinct). This is done by setting `x = i + 1` and `y = i % n + 1`. This ensures each house is placed in a unique column and row, satisfying the view requirement.

4. **Finding Visits**: For each wizard, the program tries to find a house that is exactly `a_i` distance away. It does this by iterating over all pairs of houses and checking the distance. If a valid house is found, it sets the corresponding entry in the `visits` list. 

5. **Output Determination**: If a valid configuration is found (i.e., no `-1` in the `visits` list), the program prints "YES" followed by the house coordinates and the indices of the houses each wizard needs to visit. If not, it prints "NO".

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly under the specified conditions. The logic handles the constraints of the problem effectively and ensures that all requirements are met.

Correctness: **True**
