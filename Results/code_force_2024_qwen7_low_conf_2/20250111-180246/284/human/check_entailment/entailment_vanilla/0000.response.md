Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step verification process:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into tokens, correctly extracting `n` and the list of `a_i`.

2. **Validation of Input**: The program checks if any `a_i` value is greater than `2 * (n - 1)`. Since all `a_i` are even, if `a_i > 2 * (n - 1)`, it's impossible to find another house within that distance because the maximum Manhattan distance in an `n x n` grid is `2 * (n - 1)`. This check is necessary and correct.

3. **Placing Houses**: The program places houses in a way that ensures each house occupies a unique column (i.e., `x`-coordinates are distinct). This is done by setting `x = i + 1` and `y = i % n + 1`. This ensures each house is placed in a unique column and row, satisfying the view requirement.

4. **Finding Visits**: For each wizard, the program tries to find a house that is exactly `a_i` distance away. It does this by iterating over all pairs of houses and checking the distance. If a valid house is found, it sets the corresponding entry in the `visits` list. 

5. **Output Determination**: If a valid configuration is found (i.e., no `-1` in the `visits` list), the program prints "YES" followed by the house coordinates and the indices of the houses each wizard needs to visit. If not, it prints "NO".

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly under the specified conditions. The logic handles the constraints of the problem effectively and ensures that all requirements are met.

Correctness: **True**
