Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- `visits[n-1]` is `2`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `1`.
- `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop increments `j` by `1` in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `2`.

2. **Check the Conditions for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n`. Since `n` is not specified, we assume it is greater than `1` (as `j` starts from `0`).

### Updated States:
- `visits` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `j` will be `2`.
- `dist` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `2`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `2`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.**
