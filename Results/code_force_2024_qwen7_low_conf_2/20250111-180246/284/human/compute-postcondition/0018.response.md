The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `x`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, the new value of `x` becomes `2 + 1`, which is 3. The values of `i`, `n`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `x` is 3, `n` must be defined and an integer, `y` is `1 % n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 3, `n` must be defined and an integer, `y` is `1 % n + 1`**
