Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `visits` is a list of length `n`.
   - Each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - `visits[0]` is `n`.
   - `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found.
   - `i` is `0`.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - `dist` is `0`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 0` and iterates up to `j < n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the context, we need to determine how the states change.

4. **Conditions to Continue the Loop:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.
   - The loop will break if `dist == a[i]` when `i != j`.

5. **Current States at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` remains `0` because the loop is iterating over `j`.
   - `j` will increment by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `visits[0]` remains `n` because `i` is `0` and there is no condition that changes it directly.
   - `visits[n-1]` may change if a valid `j` is found, but since the loop hasn't completed its iterations yet, we cannot assume it has changed.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `1`.
   - `dist` remains `0` unless `dist == a[i]` is met and the inner loop or if statement is broken out of, but since the loop is just starting, `dist` remains `0`.

Given these points, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

**State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[0]` is `n`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`, and `dist` is `0`.**
