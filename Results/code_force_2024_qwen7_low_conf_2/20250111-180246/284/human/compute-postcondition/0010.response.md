`x` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 0, the value of `x` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `data` is a list of strings representing the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements of `data[1:]` to integers, any element in `a` is less than or equal to \(2 \times (n - 1)\), `houses` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `x` is 1.
