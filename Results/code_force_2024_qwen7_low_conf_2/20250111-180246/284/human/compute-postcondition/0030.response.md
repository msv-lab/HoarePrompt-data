Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` if the distance `dist` equals `a[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits[i]` remain unchanged.***
