According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range `n`, meaning it will continue until `j` reaches `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- `visits[0]` is `n`.
- `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found.
- `i` is `0`.
- `j` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from its current value of `n-1` to `n`. Since the loop runs through `range(n)`, the next value of `j` will be `0`.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `visits` remains the same.
- `i` remains `0`.
- `j` becomes `0`.

State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[0]` is `n`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`.**
