Postcondition: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), ensuring that for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, there exists a `j` such that the distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. If no such `j` exists, then `visits[i]` remains `-1`. There is at least one element in `visits` that is equal to -1**.
