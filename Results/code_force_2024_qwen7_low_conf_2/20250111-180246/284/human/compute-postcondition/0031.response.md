Postcondition: **`i` is an integer and `j` is an integer. If the condition `i != j` is true, then `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, and `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` if `dist` equals `a[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits[i]` remain unchanged.**
