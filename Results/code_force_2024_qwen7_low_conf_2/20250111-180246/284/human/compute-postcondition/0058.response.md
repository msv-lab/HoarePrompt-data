Postcondition: ***`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `2`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `1`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`. If `dist == a[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables `visits`, `i`, `j`, and `dist`.***
