Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `data` is a list of strings representing the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements of `data[1:]` to integers. There exists at least one element `ai` in `a` such that `ai` is greater than \(2 \times (n - 1)\).***
