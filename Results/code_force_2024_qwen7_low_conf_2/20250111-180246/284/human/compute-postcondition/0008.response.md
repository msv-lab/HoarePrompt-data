The code initializes an empty list called `houses`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `data`, nor does it modify the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `houses` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `data` is a list of strings representing the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements of `data[1:]` to integers, any element in `a` is less than or equal to \(2 \times (n - 1)\); `houses` is an empty list**
