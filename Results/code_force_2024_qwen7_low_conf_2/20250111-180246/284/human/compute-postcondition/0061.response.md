The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the points `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `2`
- `dist` is initially `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`

After executing the code, `dist` will be updated to the calculated distance.

Since `i` and `j` are specific indices and `houses` is a list of coordinates, let's denote the coordinates as follows:
- `houses[i]` is `houses[n-1]`
- `houses[j]` is `houses[2]`

Thus, `dist` will be `abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[2][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[2][1])`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `2`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `2`; `dist` is `abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[2][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[2][1])`**
