Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[0]` is `n`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `dist` is `abs(houses[0][0] - houses[0][0]) + abs(houses[0][1] - houses[0][1])` which evaluates to `0`.**
