The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from standard input and splits it into a list of strings. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, \ldots, a_n\) is given where each \(a_i\) is an even integer between 0 and \(n\) inclusive. After executing the code, the input line is split into a list of strings.

Since the input line is split into a list of strings and stored in `data`, the value of `n` remains unchanged, and `data` is a list of strings corresponding to the input. The original list of integers \(a_1, \ldots, a_n\) is no longer directly accessible as `a_i` values but can be derived from `data` if needed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `data` is a list of strings representing the input.**
