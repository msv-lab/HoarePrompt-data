The code calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in a 2D space using the coordinates of `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. However, the initial state does not provide the actual coordinates of the houses. Since `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `1`, the coordinates of these points are not specified. The `dist` variable is assigned the absolute difference in the x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in the y-coordinates.

Given that the initial state does not provide the exact coordinates, the value of `dist` cannot be determined numerically. But we can express `dist` in terms of the coordinates.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `1`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.**
