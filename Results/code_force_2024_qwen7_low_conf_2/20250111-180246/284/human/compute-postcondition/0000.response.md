The code `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` variable to point to `sys.stdin.read`. This changes how input is read from standard input. However, this does not change the values of the variables `n` or the list of integers `a_1, \ldots, a_n`. The initial conditions remain intact.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, \ldots, a_n is given where each a_i is an even integer between 0 and n inclusive. Input is now read using `sys.stdin.read` instead of the default input function.**
