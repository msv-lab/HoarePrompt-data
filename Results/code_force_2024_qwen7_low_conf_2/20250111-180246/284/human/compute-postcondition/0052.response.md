Postcondition: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between houses[n-1] and houses[0]. If `dist` is equal to `a[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
