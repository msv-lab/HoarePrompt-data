`visits[i]` is updated to `j + 1`. Given that `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `2`, the expression `j + 1` evaluates to `3`. Therefore, `visits[i]` which is `visits[n-1]` is set to `3`. The value of `visits[n-1]` changes from `2` to `3`.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `3`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `2`; `dist` is `abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[2][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[2][1])`**
