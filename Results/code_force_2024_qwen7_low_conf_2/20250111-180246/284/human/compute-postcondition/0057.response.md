The `break` statement is executed, which does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that the loop or conditional block has been exited. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `2`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `1`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
