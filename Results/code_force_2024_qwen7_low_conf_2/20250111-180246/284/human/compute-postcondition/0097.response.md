The code `print(x, y)` prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, since `x` and `y` are undefined in the initial state, they are not assigned any specific values within this line of code. Therefore, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

The states of `visits` and `houses` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `houses` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined**
