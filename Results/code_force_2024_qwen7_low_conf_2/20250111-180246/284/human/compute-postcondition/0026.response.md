The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Since `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` are not defined in the initial state, we assume they are lists containing at least two integers representing coordinates (x, y). The value of `dist` is assigned the absolute difference in the x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of the two points. The variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`**
