The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. However, since no loop or if statement is mentioned in the given code, the only impact is that we break out of the implied context.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `3`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `2`; `dist` is `abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[2][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[2][1])` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
