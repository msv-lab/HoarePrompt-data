`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Initially, `i` is `0` and `j` is `n-1`. Therefore, `visits[0]` becomes `n`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[0]` is `n`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n-1`, `dist` is `abs(houses[0][0] - houses[n-1][0]) + abs(houses[0][1] - houses[n-1][1])`, the distance `dist` is equal to `a[0]`**
