The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in a 2D space using the absolute differences of their coordinates. Here, `i` and `j` are indices into the `houses` list. The distance is stored in the variable `dist`. Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is `0`.
   - The condition `i != j` holds true.

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   dist = abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])
   ```

3. Since `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `0`, the indices point to the last and first elements of the `houses` list, respectively. The distance calculation will be:
   - `abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[0][0])` for the x-coordinates.
   - `abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[0][1])` for the y-coordinates.
   - Adding these two values gives the Manhattan distance.

4. The variables `visits`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Only `dist` is updated with the calculated distance.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between houses[n-1] and houses[0]**.
