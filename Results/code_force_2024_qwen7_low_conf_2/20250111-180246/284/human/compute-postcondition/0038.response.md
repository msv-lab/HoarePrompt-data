According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates over the range defined by `n`, meaning that the loop can execute again as long as `j < n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is an integer.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1`.
- `i` is not equal to `j_prev + 1`.
- `visits[i]` is updated to `j_prev + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be less than `n`.
- Since `j` is initially set to `j_prev + 1` and incremented within the loop, we need to consider the value of `j` after the previous iteration.
- Given that `i` is not equal to `j_prev + 1` and `visits[i]` is updated to `j_prev + 2`, it implies that `j` started from `j_prev + 1` and incremented to a new value. However, we do not know the exact value of `j` after the update, but we know it must be incremented from `j_prev + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `j` needs to be `j_prev + 2` (since it was incremented from `j_prev + 1` and the loop exits when the condition is met).

Thus, `j` must be `j_prev + 2` for the loop to continue, and `j` must be less than `n`.

State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, and `j` must be less than `n`.**
