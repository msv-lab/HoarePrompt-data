According to the code, the loop depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive)
- `visits[n-1]` is `1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `j` is `0`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` starts at `0` and increases with each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `visits` remains the same
- `i` remains `n-1`
- `j` becomes `1`

State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `1`.**
