The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the program will exit the loop or if statement it was currently inside. 

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between houses[n-1] and houses[0]; the current value of `dist` is equal to `a[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
