Let's break down the given information and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `n-1`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is already set to `n-1`.
   - `j` is already set to `n-1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` using `range(n)`. This means `j` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Current State:**
   - `j` is currently `n-1`.

5. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `n` at the beginning of the loop.
   - Since `j` is already `n-1`, it is equal to `n-1` and not less than `n`, so the loop will not execute even once based on the current state.

### Required Adjustments:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `j` must be less than `n` at the start. Therefore, `j` should be set to `0` or any value less than `n`.

### Final State:
- `visits` remains a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- `i` remains `n-1`.
- `j` must be set to `0` to allow the loop to execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `i` is `n-1`, and `j` is `0`**.
