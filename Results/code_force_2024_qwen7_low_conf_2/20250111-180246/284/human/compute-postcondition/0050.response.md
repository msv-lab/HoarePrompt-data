The code snippet sets `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n-1` and `j` is `0`. Therefore, `visits[i]` is updated to `0 + 1`, which is `1`.

All other variables remain unchanged in value.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between houses[n-1] and houses[0]; the current value of `dist` is equal to `a[i]`.**
