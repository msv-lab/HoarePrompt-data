The code `a = list(map(int, data[1:]))` impacts the following:
- It converts each element in the sublist `data[1:]` (all elements except the first one) into integers and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The original `data` list remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` retains its initial value, which is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\); `data` is a list of strings representing the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements of `data[1:]` to integers.**
