The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. Given the initial state, `x` is 3 and `y` is `2 % n + 1`. Since `n` must be defined and is an integer, let's assume its value for the calculation. However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we'll keep it in the expression.

The tuple `(x, y)` will be appended to `houses` as `(3, 2 % n + 1)`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `y` are updated accordingly. The initial state of `i` and `x` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 3, `n` must be defined and an integer, `y` is 2 % n + 1, `houses` contains [(3, 2 % n + 1)]**
