The code `break` does not affect any variable values but indicates the exit from the current loop or conditional block. Since the `break` statement is not within a loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, its presence here does not change the values of any variables. 

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where `visits[0]` is `j + 1`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `dist` is `0`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
