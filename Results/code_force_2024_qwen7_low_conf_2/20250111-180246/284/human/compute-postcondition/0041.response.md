The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the current loop or match statement, which in this context means it breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the loop that was iterating over `i` and `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is an integer
- `j` is `j_prev + 2` and ensures `j < n`
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`
- `visits[i]` is `j + 1`

The `break` statement does not affect these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and ensures `j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
