`houses` is a list that does not exist in the initial state, and `append` adds a tuple `(x, y)` to this list. Given that `x` is 2 and `y` is `1 % n + 1`, since `n` is undefined, we cannot determine the exact value of `y`. However, since `n` is undefined, the expression `1 % n + 1` will result in an error when evaluated. The code will not run as expected because `n` is undefined, leading to a NameError. Therefore, the only thing that happens is that an error occurs during the execution.

Output State: **An error occurs due to undefined variable `n`, and the variables remain unchanged: `i` is 1, `x` is 2, `n` is undefined, `y` is `1 % n + 1`.**
