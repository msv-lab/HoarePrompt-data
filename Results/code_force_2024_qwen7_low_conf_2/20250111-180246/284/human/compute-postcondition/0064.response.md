Postcondition: ***`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is either `2` or `3` depending on the condition `dist == a[i]`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `2`; `dist` is `abs(houses[n-1][0] - houses[2][0]) + abs(houses[n-1][1] - houses[2][1])`. If `dist == a[i]`, `visits[n-1]` is set to `3` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `visits[n-1]` remains `2`.***
