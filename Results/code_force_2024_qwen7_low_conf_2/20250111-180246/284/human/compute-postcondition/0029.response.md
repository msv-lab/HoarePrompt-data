The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, and `visits[i]`. It simply breaks out of the current loop or nested structure, but does not change any variable values.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is `j + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or nested structure.**
