`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. The previous values of `i`, `j`, and `dist` remain unchanged. The output state is:

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is `j + 1`.**
