According to the code, the loop condition depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:

- `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
- `visits[n-1]` is either a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n`. However, since `i` is already `n-1`, it will not satisfy the condition `i < n` unless `i` is set to `0`.

Let's summarize the states that need to be adjusted:

- `visits` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is set to `0` to start the next iteration.
- `j` remains `n-1` because the loop body does not modify `j` directly based on the given information.

State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is either a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found; `i` is `0`; `j` is `n-1`**
