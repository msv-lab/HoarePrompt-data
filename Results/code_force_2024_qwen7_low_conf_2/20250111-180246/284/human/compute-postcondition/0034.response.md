`visits[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. From the initial state, `j` is equal to `j_prev + 1`. Therefore, `visits[i]` is set to `(j_prev + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `j_prev + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is `j_prev + 2`**
