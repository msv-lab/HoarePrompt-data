The code snippet assigns the value of `i % n + 1` to `y`. However, the value of `n` is not defined in the initial state, and there is no input or assignment to `n` within the provided code snippet. Therefore, `n` remains undefined, and the operation `i % n + 1` cannot be evaluated without a specific value for `n`.

Given the initial state where `i` is 1, and `x` is 2, and since `n` remains undefined, the output state will reflect that `n` is undefined and `y` is dependent on `i % n + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 2, `n` is undefined, `y` is `1 % n + 1`**
