The code `houses.append((x, y))` appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `houses`. Given the initial state where `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, the tuple `(1, 1)` will be appended to `houses`. The values of `n`, `data`, `a`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `data` is a list of strings representing the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements of `data[1:]` to integers, any element in `a` is less than or equal to \(2 \times (n - 1)\), `houses` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `x` is 1, `y` is 1**
