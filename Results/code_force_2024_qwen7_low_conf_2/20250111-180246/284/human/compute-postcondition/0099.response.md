The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` is the first element of the next pair in `houses` and `y` is the second element of the next pair in `houses`, these values are printed but do not change the state of the variables. The list `visits` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `houses` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, `x` is the first element of the next pair in `houses`, `y` is the second element of the next pair in `houses`, the values of `x` and `y` are printed.**
