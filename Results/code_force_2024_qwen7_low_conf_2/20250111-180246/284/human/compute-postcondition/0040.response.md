The code updates `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Based on the initial state, `i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and ensures `j < n`, and `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. After executing the code, `visits[i]` will be updated to `j + 1`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and ensures `j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`; `visits[i]` is `j + 1`**
