`dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`. Given that `j` is `j_prev + 1` and `i` is not equal to `j_prev + 1`, `i` remains unchanged and `j` is updated to `j_prev + 1`. The value of `dist` is calculated as the absolute difference in the x-coordinates plus the absolute difference in the y-coordinates of `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`**
