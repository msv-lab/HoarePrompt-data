Postcondition: ***`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `1`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `0`. If `i` is not equal to `j`, and the Manhattan distance between houses[n-1] and houses[0] is equal to `a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues as normal without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
