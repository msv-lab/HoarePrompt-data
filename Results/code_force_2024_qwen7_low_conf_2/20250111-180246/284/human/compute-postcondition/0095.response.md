The code `print(x, y)` simply prints the values of `x` and `y`. However, the variables `x` and `y` are not defined in the provided code snippet. Since they are not defined, their values remain undefined, and no changes occur to any variables. The print statement itself does not assign any values to `x` or `y`.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and `houses` is a non-empty iterable, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined**
