Postcondition: ***`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[0]` is `n`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, and `dist` is `0`. If `i != j`, then `visits[0]` is updated to `j + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `dist == a[i]`. If `i == j`, no change is made to the variables' states.***
