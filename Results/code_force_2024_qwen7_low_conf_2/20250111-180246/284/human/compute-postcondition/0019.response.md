The code `y = i % n + 1` impacts the value of `y` by taking the modulo of `i` with `n` and then adding 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `x` is 3, `n` must be defined and an integer, and `y` is `1 % n + 1`, let's calculate the new value of `y`.

Since `i` is 2 and `n` must be an integer, `i % n` would be `2 % n`. The value of `y` is updated to this result plus 1. The initial value of `y` is `1 % n + 1`. 

Given these conditions, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 3, `n` must be defined and an integer, `y` is `2 % n + 1`**
