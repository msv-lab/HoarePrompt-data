`dist` is assigned the value of the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, which is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences in their x-coordinates and y-coordinates. The values of `i` and `j_prev + 2` are used to determine `j`. The value of `j` remains less than `n`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and ensures `j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.**
