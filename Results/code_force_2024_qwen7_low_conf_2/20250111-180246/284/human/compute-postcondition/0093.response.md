The code snippet simply prints 'YES' and does not modify any variables in the `visits` list or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is the output printed to the console, which is 'YES'. The `visits` list remains unchanged.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and we print 'YES' to the console.**
