Postcondition: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[0]` is `n`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `1`, and `dist` is \(|n - visits[1]| + |visits[1] - visits[2]|\). If `dist == a[i]`, then `visits[1]` is `2`; otherwise, the original values of `visits[1]` are retained.**
