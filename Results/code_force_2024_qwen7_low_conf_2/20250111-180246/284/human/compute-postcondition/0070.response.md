The code calculates the Euclidean distance between the coordinates of `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` using the formula `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`. Here, `i` is `0` and `j` is `n-1`. Therefore, the distance `dist` is calculated as follows:

1. `houses[i][0]` is `houses[0][0]`.
2. `houses[j][0]` is `houses[n-1][0]`.
3. `houses[i][1]` is `houses[0][1]`.
4. `houses[j][1]` is `houses[n-1][1]`.

The distance `dist` is the sum of the absolute differences in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `n-1`, `dist` is `abs(houses[0][0] - houses[n-1][0]) + abs(houses[0][1] - houses[n-1][1])`**
