Postcondition: ***`visits` is a list of length `n` where `visits[0]` is `j + 1`, `visits[n-1]` is a value between `1` and `n` if a valid `j` is found, or `n-1` if no valid `j` is found, `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `dist` is `0`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `dist == a[i]`. If `dist != a[i]`, no change is made to the variables' states.***
