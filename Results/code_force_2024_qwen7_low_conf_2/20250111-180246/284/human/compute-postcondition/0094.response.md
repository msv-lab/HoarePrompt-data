Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop is iterating over the `houses` variable using `enumerate`, which means `houses` should be a list or iterable.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - `visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive).
   - We print 'YES' to the console.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `houses` must be a non-empty iterable (list, tuple, etc.). If `houses` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `houses`, `houses` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `x` and `y` in the loop are not specified, but they will be set during each iteration based on the elements of `houses`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `houses` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and `houses` is a non-empty iterable (e.g., a list with at least one element)**.
