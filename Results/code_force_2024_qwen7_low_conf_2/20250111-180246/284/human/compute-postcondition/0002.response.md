`n` is assigned the value of `data[0]`, which is converted to an integer using `int()`. The value of `n` is now an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). The variable `data` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `data` is a list of strings representing the input.**
