The code `visits[i] = j + 1` updates the value of `visits[i]` to `j + 1`. Given the initial conditions:

- `visits[i]` is initially set to `visits[n-1]`, which is `1`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `j` is `1`.

After executing the code, `visits[i]` (which is `visits[n-1]`) will be updated to `j + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive); `visits[n-1]` is `2`; `i` is `n-1`; `j` is `1`; `dist` is `abs(houses[i][0] - houses[j][0]) + abs(houses[i][1] - houses[j][1])`.**
