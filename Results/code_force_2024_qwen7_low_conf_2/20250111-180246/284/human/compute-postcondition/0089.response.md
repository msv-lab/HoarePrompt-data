Output State: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive), ensuring that for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, there exists a `j` such that the distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. If no such `j` exists, then `visits[i]` remains `-1`.** 

Explanation:
- The outer loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
- For each `i`, the inner loop iterates over each index `j` from `0` to `n-1` (excluding `i` itself).
- The condition `if dist == a[i]` checks if the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` matches the value `a[i]`.
- If such a `j` is found, `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` and the inner loop breaks.
- If no such `j` is found by the end of the inner loop, `visits[i]` remains `-1`.

Since the loop iterates over all `i` and `j` combinations, after all iterations, `visits[i]` will be set to the correct `j + 1` if the condition is met, or remain `-1` if no valid `j` is found.
