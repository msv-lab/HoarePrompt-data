Postcondition: **`visits` is a list of length `n` where each element `visits[i]` is set to a value from `1` to `n` (inclusive). For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, there exists a `j` such that the distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]` is equal to `a[i]`. If no such `j` exists, then `visits[i]` remains `-1`. If there is at least one element in `visits` that is equal to `-1`, then nothing is printed to the console. Otherwise, the values of `x` and `y` are printed, where `x` is the last element of the last pair processed in `houses` and `y` is the second element of the last pair processed in `houses`.**
