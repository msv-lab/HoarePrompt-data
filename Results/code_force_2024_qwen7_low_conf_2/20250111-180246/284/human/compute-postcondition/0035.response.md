The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial state and the code snippet, no changes are made to the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, or `visits[i]`. The `break` statement simply indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional structure.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`, `visits[i]` is `j_prev + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
