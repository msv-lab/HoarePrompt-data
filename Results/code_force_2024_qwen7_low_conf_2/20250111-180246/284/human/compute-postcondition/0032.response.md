Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `j` is an integer.
   - The condition `i != j` is true.
   - `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `houses[i]` and `houses[j]`.
   - `visits[i]` is set to `j + 1` if `dist` equals `a[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `0` to `n-1`. 

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was the value it had at the end of the previous iteration. Let's denote this value as `j_prev`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range, i.e., `j_prev + 1`.

4. **Ensuring the Condition Holds**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop condition `i != j` remains true.
   - Since `i` is fixed and does not change within the loop, we only need to ensure that the new `j` value (which is `j_prev + 1`) is not equal to `i`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is now `j_prev + 1`.
   - `dist` and `visits[i]` might have been updated based on the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the state to prepare for the next iteration, we don't need to specify these changes here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `j_prev + 1`**.
