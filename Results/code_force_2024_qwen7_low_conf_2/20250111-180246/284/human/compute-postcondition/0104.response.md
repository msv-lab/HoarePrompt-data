Functionality: **The function takes an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) even integers \( a \) as input. It first checks if any element in \( a \) exceeds \( 2 \times (n - 1) \). If any element does, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it constructs a list of house coordinates based on the indices. Then, it attempts to find a valid visiting sequence for each house such that the distance between consecutive houses matches the corresponding element in \( a \). If a valid sequence can be found for all houses, it prints 'YES' followed by the house coordinates and the visiting sequence. If any house cannot be visited according to the conditions, it prints 'NO'. However, due to missing logic, the function might incorrectly print 'YES' even if not all houses can be visited correctly, as the condition check at the end only ensures the absence of -1 in visits, which is insufficient to guarantee a valid visiting sequence for all houses.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
1. The function does not correctly ensure that a valid visiting sequence exists for all houses. The check for 'NO' at the end is insufficient because it only checks if there is any unvisited house, but does not validate the correctness of the visiting sequence for all houses.
2. The function should ideally return a boolean indicating whether a valid sequence exists instead of printing 'YES' or 'NO'.
3. The function should handle the case where the input list \( a \) is empty, although this case is not explicitly handled in the provided code.
