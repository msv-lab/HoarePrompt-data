Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `data` is a list of strings representing the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements of `data[1:]` to integers, any element in `a` is less than or equal to \(2 \times (n - 1)\), `houses` is a list containing tuples \((i+1, i \% n + 1)\) for all \(i\) in the range \(0\) to \(n-1\), `i` is \(n-1\), `x` is \(n\), `y` is `n \% n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from \(i = 0\) to \(i = n-1\). Each iteration appends a tuple \((x, y)\) to the `houses` list, where \(x = i + 1\) and \(y = i \% n + 1\).
- After \(n\) iterations, the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will be \(n-1\).
- The `x` value in each tuple will range from \(1\) to \(n\), corresponding to \(i + 1\).
- The `y` value in each tuple will also range from \(1\) to \(n\), corresponding to \(i \% n + 1\).

Since the loop runs exactly \(n\) times, the final state of the `houses` list will contain all the tuples generated by the loop. Therefore, the output state is as described above.
