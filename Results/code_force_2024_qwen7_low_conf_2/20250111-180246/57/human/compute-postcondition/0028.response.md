The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the constraints, it seems it might be designed to handle multiple test cases internally. However, for the purpose of describing the functionality according to the given format, we will focus on the input constraints.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` and `x` are integers such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).

Given the output cases are not specified directly within the function definition, we infer the following:

- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it uses `n` and `x` to perform some operation.
- Based on the result of the operation, the function returns a specific value for each test case.

However, since no specific output or return values are provided, we can only describe the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and for each of the `t` test cases, it accepts two integers `n` and `x` where \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).**
