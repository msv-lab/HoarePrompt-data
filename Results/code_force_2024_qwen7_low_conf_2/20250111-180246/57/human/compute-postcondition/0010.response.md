Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `index` is 2.
   - `results` is a list containing `func_1(n, x)`.
   - `n` is the first element in the `data` list.
   - `x` is the second element in the `data` list.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - The loop variable `_` is incremented by 1 each time the loop iterates.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` remains a positive integer (since it doesn't change inside the loop).
   - `index` is 2 (it does not change inside the loop either).
   - `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`.
   - `n` is still the first element in the `data` list.
   - `x` is still the second element in the `data` list.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 (which it is, since it is a positive integer).
   - The value of `index` remains 2.
   - The contents of `results` remain unchanged.
   - `n` and `x` remain the same as they are part of the `data` list and do not change within the loop.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (it will be decremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration but is still positive).
   - `index` is still 2.
   - `results` remains the same.
   - `n` is still the first element in the `data` list.
   - `x` is still the second element in the `data` list.

So, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the first element in the `data` list, `x` is the second element in the `data` list**
