The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `x`. However, it does affect how input is handled in subsequent parts of the program. The `sys.stdin.read` function reads the entire input stream as a single string.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`
- `n` and `x` are integers for each test case such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`

The code snippet does not perform any operations on these variables, it only changes the behavior of the `input` function.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`; `n` and `x` are integers for each test case such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`; `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
