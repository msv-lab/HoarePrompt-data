`index` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer.**
