Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `count` is the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` within the specified conditions, `cycle_length` is `2 * k - 2`, `position_in_cycle` is `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as `2 * k - 2 <= n`. Each iteration increments `k` by 1.
- The loop will terminate when `2 * k - 2` exceeds `n`.
- For each iteration, `cycle_length` is set to `2 * k - 2`.
- `position_in_cycle` is calculated as `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
- `expected_number` is determined based on whether `position_in_cycle` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `count` is incremented if `expected_number` equals `x`.
- After the loop completes, `k` will be `original_k + (number_of_iterations)`, where `original_k` is 2 and `number_of_iterations` is the number of times the loop executed.
- `count` will be the number of times the condition `expected_number == x` was satisfied during the loop executions.
