`index` is incremented by 2, starting from its initial value of 0. Therefore, the new value of `index` is 2. The states of the other variables (`results`, `n`, `x`, and `data`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element in the `data` list, `x` is the second element in the `data` list**
