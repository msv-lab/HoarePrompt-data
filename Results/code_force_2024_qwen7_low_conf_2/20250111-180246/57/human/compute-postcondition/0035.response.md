Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `x`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n. It iterates through values of `k` starting from 2, incrementing by 1 each time, until 2 * k - 2 exceeds `n`. For each value of `k`, it calculates the `cycle_length` as 2 * k - 2 and the `position_in_cycle` as (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1. Based on the value of `position_in_cycle`, it determines the `expected_number` and checks if it equals `x`. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` under the specified conditions. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 4 by ensuring that the loop only runs when `n` is at least 4.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function ensures that `n` is at least 4 before entering the loop, as `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the calculations to proceed correctly.
- The function does not handle cases where `x` is 0 or when `x` is equal to `n`, which could lead to undefined behavior if `n` is exactly 10^9. However, since `x` is defined as 1 ≤ x < n, these edge cases are inherently covered.
