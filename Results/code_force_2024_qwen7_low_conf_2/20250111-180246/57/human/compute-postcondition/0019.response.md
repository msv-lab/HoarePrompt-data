The code appends the result of `func_1(n, x)` to the `results` list. Since `n` and `x` are both the sixth elements in the `data` list, the function call `func_1(n, x)` will be appended to `results`. However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only express the appended value in terms of `n` and `x`.

Given that `n` and `x` are the same (the sixth elements in the `data` list), `func_1(n, x)` is the value that gets appended to `results`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 7, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` is appended, `n` is the sixth element in the `data` list, `x` is the sixth element in the `data` list**
