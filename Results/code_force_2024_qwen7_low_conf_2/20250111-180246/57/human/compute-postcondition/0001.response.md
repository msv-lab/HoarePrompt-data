`data` is assigned the result of splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`. The input is split into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are not directly used in this line of code, so they remain unchanged. The output state is updated to reflect the assignment of `data`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `n` and `x` are integers for each test case such that `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`, `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.**
