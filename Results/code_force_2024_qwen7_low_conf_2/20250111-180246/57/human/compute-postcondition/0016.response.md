The code assigns the value at `data[index]` to `n`. Given that `index` is 5, `n` will take the value of the sixth element in the `data` list. Since `n` was previously defined as the third element in the `data` list and `x` as the fourth element, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 5, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` appended, `n` is the sixth element in the `data` list, `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer**
