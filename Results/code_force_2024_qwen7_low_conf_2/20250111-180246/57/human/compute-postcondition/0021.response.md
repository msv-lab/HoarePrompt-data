Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `index` is calculated as `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, x)`, where `n` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i` and `x` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`.

### Analysis:

1. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` is given as a positive integer, so no change is needed for this variable.

2. **Variable `index`:**
   - The value of `index` is already determined as `1 + 2 * t`.
   - No change is needed for `index`.

3. **List `results`:**
   - `results` is a list with `t` elements.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least `t` elements. Since it is stated that `results` contains exactly `t` elements, no change is needed for `results`.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `results`.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must not be an empty list. Since we know `results` has `t` elements, this condition is satisfied.

5. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the elements in `results` are accessible during the loop execution.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be explicitly mentioned in the final state description is that `results` must have `t` elements, which is already given. There are no other variables or conditions that need adjustment based on the provided information.

### Final State:
**`t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing exactly `t` elements.** 

However, since the problem specifically asks for states that need to be adjusted, and none of the provided variables (`t`, `index`, or `results`) need adjustment, the state remains as initially provided.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing exactly `t` elements.**
