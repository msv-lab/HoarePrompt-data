The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Given the initial state, `index` is 5, so `data[index + 1]` refers to the sixth element in the `data` list. Since `n` is the sixth element in the `data` list, `x` is assigned the value of `n`.

The output state will be:

- `t` is a positive integer (unchanged)
- `index` is 5 (unchanged)
- `results` contains `func_1(n, x)` (unchanged)
- `func_1(n, x)` is appended (unchanged)
- `n` is the sixth element in the `data` list (unchanged)
- `x` is the sixth element in the `data` list (since `x = int(data[index + 1])` and `index + 1` refers to the sixth element)

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 5, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` is appended, `n` is the sixth element in the `data` list, `x` is the sixth element in the `data` list**
