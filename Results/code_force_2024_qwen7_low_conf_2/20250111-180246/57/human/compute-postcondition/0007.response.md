The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. Since `index` is 0, `data[index + 1]` refers to the second element in the `data` list. The value of `x` becomes the second element of the `data` list, while the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element in the `data` list, `x` is the second element in the `data` list**
