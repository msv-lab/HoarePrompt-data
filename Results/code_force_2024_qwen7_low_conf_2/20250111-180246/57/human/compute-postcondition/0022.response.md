The `print(result)` statement prints the value of the variable `result`, but it does not change the value of `result`. The other variables (`t`, `index`, and `results`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing exactly `t` elements.**
