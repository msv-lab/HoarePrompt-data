According to the given for loop, the loop will execute `t` times. For this to happen, the following conditions must be met:

1. The variable `t` must be a positive integer because the range function will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.
2. The variable `index` must be 0 when the loop starts since the loop starts at the second element (`data[1]`), but we need to ensure the initial condition before the loop.
3. The variable `results` should remain an empty list as specified.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The loop requires `t` to be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `index` should be 0 at the start of the loop body.
3. The variable `results` should remain an empty list.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
