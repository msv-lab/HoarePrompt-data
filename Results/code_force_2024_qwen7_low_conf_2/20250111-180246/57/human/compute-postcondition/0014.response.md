`results` is a list that contains `func_1(n, x)`. The code appends `func_1(n, x)` to the `results` list. The values of `n` and `x` are taken from the `data` list: `n` is the third element, and `x` is the fourth element as an integer. Since these values are used to call `func_1(n, x)`, the value of `func_1(n, x)` is added to the `results` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` appended, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer**
