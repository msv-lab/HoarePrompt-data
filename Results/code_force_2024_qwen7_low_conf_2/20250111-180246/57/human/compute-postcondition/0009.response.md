`results.append(func_1(n, x))` appends the result of `func_1(n, x)` to the list `results`. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `n` and `x`, which are the first and second elements of the `data` list, respectively. However, the actual value of `func_1(n, x)` is not specified, so we will keep it as `func_1(n, x)`. The value of `index` remains unchanged, and the value of `t` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `results` is a list containing `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the first element in the `data` list, `x` is the second element in the `data` list**
