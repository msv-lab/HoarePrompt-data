`index` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `index` is 5, so after executing `index += 2`, the new value of `index` is 7. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 7, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` is appended, `n` is the sixth element in the `data` list, `x` is the sixth element in the `data` list**
