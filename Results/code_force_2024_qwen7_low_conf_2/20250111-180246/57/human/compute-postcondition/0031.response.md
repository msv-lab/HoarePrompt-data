`k` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `k` was not specified in the initial state. However, we know that `2k \leq n` and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. The value of `cycle_length` is `2 * k - 2`, and `position_in_cycle` is `n - 2k + 3`. The value of `expected_number` and its relationship to `x` does not affect `count`, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4; `2(k + 1) \leq n`; `cycle_length` is `2(k + 1) - 2`; `position_in_cycle` is `n - 2(k + 1) + 3`; `count` is unchanged.**
