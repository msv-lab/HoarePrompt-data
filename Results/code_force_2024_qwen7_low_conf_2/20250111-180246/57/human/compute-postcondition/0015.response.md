According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `t`. The loop continues to execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` was appended, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, and `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must remain a positive integer. Since the problem does not indicate any changes to `t` within the loop body (the omitted loop body), we assume `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `t` is still a positive integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 5, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `func_1(n, x)` appended, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer** 

- `index` is incremented by 1 from 4 to 5.
- `results` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop body.
- `n` and `x` remain the same as they are not modified in the loop body.
