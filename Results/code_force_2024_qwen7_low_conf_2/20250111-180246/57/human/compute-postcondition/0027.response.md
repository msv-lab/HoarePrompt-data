Let's analyze the loop step by step based on the provided initial state and the output states for the first few iterations.

### Initial State
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `index` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration, where `n` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i` and `x` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`.

### Loop Code
```
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Analysis
1. **First Iteration (t = 1):**
   - `t` is 1.
   - `index` is `1 + 2 * 1 = 3`.
   - `results` is a list containing 1 element.
   - After printing the first element of `results`, `result` is assigned to that element, and the loop exits.

2. **Second Iteration (t = 2):**
   - `t` is 2.
   - `index` is `1 + 2 * 2 = 5`.
   - `results` is a list containing 2 elements.
   - After printing the first and second elements of `results`, `result` is assigned to the last printed element, and the loop exits.

3. **Third Iteration (t = 3):**
   - `t` is 3.
   - `index` is `1 + 2 * 3 = 7`.
   - `results` is a list containing 3 elements.
   - After printing the first, second, and third elements of `results`, `result` is assigned to the last printed element, and the loop exits.

### General Case
- For any `t`, the loop will iterate `t` times.
- Each time, `result` will be assigned to an element of `results` and printed.
- After `t` iterations, `result` will be assigned to the last element of `results`, and the loop will exit.

### Final Output State
- After all iterations of the loop, `result` will be assigned to the last element of `results`, which is the result of `func_1(data[index + 2 * (t-1)], data[index + 2 * (t-1) + 1])`.
- The `print` function will return `None` after printing each element, so `result` will be assigned to `None` after the loop finishes.

### Output State
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing exactly `t` elements, `result` is the last element of `results` (which is the result of `func_1(data[index + 2 * (t-1)], data[index + 2 * (t-1) + 1])`), print function returns `None`.**
