The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`. Given that `index` is 2, `n` will be assigned the third element in the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the first element in the `data` list, and `x` is the second element in the `data` list, after executing the code, `n` will be updated to the third element in the `data` list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, `x` is the second element in the `data` list**
