The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `x`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n. The function returns `count`, which is the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to 4, with `cycle_length` being `2 * k - 2` and `position_in_cycle` being `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `x`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n. It returns `count`, the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` under specific conditions involving `n` and `k`.**
