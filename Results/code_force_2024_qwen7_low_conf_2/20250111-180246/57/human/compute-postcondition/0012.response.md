The code `x = int(data[index + 1])` updates the value of `x` by converting the element at the index `index + 1` of the `data` list into an integer. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer
- `index` is 2
- `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`
- `n` is the third element in the `data` list, i.e., `n = data[2]`
- `x` is the second element in the `data` list, i.e., `x = data[1]`

After executing the code, `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, which is `data[3]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 2, `results` contains `func_1(n, x)`, `n` is the third element in the `data` list, `x` is the fourth element in the `data` list as an integer.**
