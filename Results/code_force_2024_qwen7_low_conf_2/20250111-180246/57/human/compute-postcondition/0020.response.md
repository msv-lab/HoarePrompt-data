Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` and `x` are integers.
- `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.
- `index` is 1.
- `results` is an empty list.

### Loop Code:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    x = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(n, x))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `t` times.
2. **Variable Changes**:
   - For each iteration, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - For each iteration, `x` is set to the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
   - After setting `n` and `x`, `index` is incremented by 2.
   - `func_1(n, x)` is appended to the `results` list.

### Final State After All Iterations:
- Since the loop runs `t` times, we need to consider the final values of the variables after all iterations.
- `t` remains the same because it is the number of times the loop will run, which is given by the initial value of `t`.
- `index` will be incremented by 2 for each of the `t` iterations. Therefore, `index` will be `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration. The elements in `results` will be in the order they were appended, corresponding to the values of `n` and `x` for each iteration.

### Output State:
- `t` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `index` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration.
- The values of `n` and `x` used in `func_1(n, x)` are the elements in the `data` list starting from `data[index]` up to `data[index + 2 * t - 1]`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration, where `n` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i` and `x` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`.**
