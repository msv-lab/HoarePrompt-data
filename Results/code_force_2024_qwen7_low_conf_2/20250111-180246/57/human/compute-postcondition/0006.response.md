`n` is assigned the value of `data[index]`, where `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `index` is 0, so `n` is the first element in the `data` list. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code. The `results` list remains empty as no elements are added to it.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element in the `data` list**
