#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n, and k is an integer where k starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until 2 * k - 2 exceeds n.
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:
            expected_number = 2 * k - position_in_cycle

            count += 1
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `count` is the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` within the specified conditions, `cycle_length` is `2 * k - 2`, `position_in_cycle` is `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
    return count
    #The program returns `count`, which is the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to 4, with `cycle_length` being `2 * k - 2` and `position_in_cycle` being `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `x`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n. It iterates through values of `k` starting from 2, incrementing by 1 each time, until 2 * k - 2 exceeds `n`. For each value of `k`, it calculates the `cycle_length` as 2 * k - 2 and the `position_in_cycle` as (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1. Based on the value of `position_in_cycle`, it determines the `expected_number` and checks if it equals `x`. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` under the specified conditions. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 4 by ensuring that the loop only runs when `n` is at least 4.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and x are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration, where `n` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i` and `x` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing exactly `t` elements, `result` is the last element of `results` (which is the result of `func_1(data[index + 2 * (t-1)], data[index + 2 * (t-1) + 1])`), print function returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these integers for each test case, storing the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for all test cases. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and follows the specified constraints (i.e., `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`). If there are more than 100 test cases, the behavior is undefined. The function does not handle any missing or invalid input gracefully.
