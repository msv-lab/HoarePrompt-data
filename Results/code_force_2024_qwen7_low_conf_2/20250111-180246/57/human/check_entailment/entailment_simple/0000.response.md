Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1(n, x)`**:
   - The function iterates through possible values of `k` starting from 2 until `2 * k - 2` exceeds `n`. 
   - For each value of `k`, it calculates the cycle length (`2 * k - 2`).
   - It determines the position within the current cycle using `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
   - Depending on whether the position is within the first `k` or the second half of the cycle, it calculates the expected number.
   - It checks if the expected number matches `x` and increments the count accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the count of valid `k` values that match the conditions.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - It reads input from stdin and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, x)` and appends the result to a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Why the Program is Correct:

1. **Cycle Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the cycle length and position within the cycle, ensuring that the logic aligns with the settling pattern described.
2. **Condition Check**: The program correctly checks the conditions for each `k` to see if `x` matches the expected number based on the settling pattern.
3. **Range Handling**: The program handles the range of `n` and `x` as specified in the problem description, ensuring that the input constraints are respected.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases correctly by iterating over each one and returning the appropriate results.

Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
