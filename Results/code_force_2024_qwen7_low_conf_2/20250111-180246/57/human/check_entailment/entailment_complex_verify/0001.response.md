### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program against the problem statement and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `count` to 0 and sets `k` to 2.
2. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `2 * k - 2` is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that the cycle length `2 * k - 2` fits within `n`.
3. **Cycle Length Calculation**: `cycle_length` is set to `2 * k - 2`.
4. **Position in Cycle**: The position within the current cycle is calculated using `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`. This correctly maps the position in the sequence.
5. **Expected Number Calculation**: Depending on whether the position is within the first `k` or the second part of the cycle, the expected number `expected_number` is determined. This calculation is correct based on the problem statement.
6. **Check Condition**: If `expected_number` matches `x`, `count` is incremented. This correctly counts the valid `k` values.
7. **Increment K**: `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
8. **Return Count**: Finally, the function returns the count of valid `k`.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem description.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings. This correctly handles multiple test cases.
2. **Number of Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases `t`.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts `n` and `x`, and calls `func_1` with these values. This correctly processes each test case.
4. **Store Results**: The result of `func_1` for each test case is stored in the `results` list. This ensures that all results are collected.
5. **Output Results**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case. This correctly outputs the results.

The logic in `func_2` is also sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Verification:
- **Logic Check**: The logic in both functions correctly implements the required logic and handles all aspects of the problem statement.
- **Loop Boundaries**: The loop in `func_1` iterates through possible values of `k` until the cycle length exceeds `n`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like `k = 2` correctly. The loop starts at `k = 2` and increments by 1, ensuring all possible valid `k` values are checked.
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case appropriately.

Given the detailed analysis and the alignment of the code with the problem statement, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.

### Final:
**True**
