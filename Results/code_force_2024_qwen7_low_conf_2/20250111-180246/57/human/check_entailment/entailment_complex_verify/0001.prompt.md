You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle
        else:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n, and k is an integer where k starts at 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until 2 * k - 2 exceeds n.
def func_1(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while 2 * k - 2 <= n:
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1
        
        if position_in_cycle <= k:
            expected_number = position_in_cycle

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `count` is the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` within the specified conditions, `cycle_length` is `2 * k - 2`, `position_in_cycle` is `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
    return count
    #The program returns `count`, which is the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and `k` is greater than or equal to 4, with `cycle_length` being `2 * k - 2` and `position_in_cycle` being `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `x`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n. It iterates through values of `k` starting from 2, incrementing by 1 each time, until 2 * k - 2 exceeds `n`. For each value of `k`, it calculates the `cycle_length` as 2 * k - 2 and the `position_in_cycle` as (n - 1) % cycle_length + 1. Based on the value of `position_in_cycle`, it determines the `expected_number` and checks if it equals `x`. If `expected_number` equals `x`, it increments the `count` variable. After the loop completes, the function returns `count`, which represents the number of times `expected_number` equals `x` under the specified conditions. The function handles edge cases where `n` is less than 4 by ensuring that the loop only runs when `n` is at least 4.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and x are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        x = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        results.append(func_1(n, x))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, x)` for each iteration, where `n` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i` and `x` is the element in the `data` list at position `index + 2 * i + 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `t-1`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing exactly `t` elements, `result` is the last element of `results` (which is the result of `func_1(data[index + 2 * (t-1)], data[index + 2 * (t-1) + 1])`), print function returns `None`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these integers for each test case, storing the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for all test cases. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and follows the specified constraints (i.e., `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`). If there are more than 100 test cases, the behavior is undefined. The function does not handle any missing or invalid input gracefully.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `count` to 0 and sets `k` to 2.
2. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `2 * k - 2` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Cycle Length Calculation**: `cycle_length` is set to `2 * k - 2`.
4. **Position in Cycle**: The position within the current cycle is calculated using `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`.
5. **Expected Number Calculation**: Depending on whether the position is within the first `k` or the second part of the cycle, the expected number `expected_number` is determined.
6. **Check Condition**: If `expected_number` matches `x`, `count` is incremented.
7. **Increment K**: `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
8. **Return Count**: Finally, the function returns the count of valid `k`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Number of Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases `t`.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts `n` and `x`, and calls `func_1` with these values.
4. **Store Results**: The result of `func_1` for each test case is stored in the `results` list.
5. **Output Results**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Logic Check**: The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the expected number based on the position in the cycle and checks if it matches `x`.
- **Loop Boundaries**: The loop in `func_1` iterates through possible values of `k` until the cycle length exceeds `n`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like `k = 2` correctly.
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case appropriately.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all aspects of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
