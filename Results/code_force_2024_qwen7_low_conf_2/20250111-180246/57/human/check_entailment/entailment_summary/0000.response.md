Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to solve the given problem statement accurately.
2. The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to determine how many values of `k` satisfy the condition based on Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received.
   - It iterates over possible values of `k`, calculating the cycle length (`2 * k - 2`) and the position within that cycle (`(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`).
   - It then determines the expected number in that position and checks if it matches `x`.
   - Edge cases where `n` is less than 4 are handled appropriately.
3. The `func_2` function reads the test cases from standard input, processes them using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - It correctly reads multiple test cases and processes them one by one.
   - It uses `func_1` to compute the number of valid `k` values for each test case and collects the results in a list.
   - It prints the results in the required format.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, both functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem. They handle all cases as specified and produce the correct outputs.

Correctness: **True**
