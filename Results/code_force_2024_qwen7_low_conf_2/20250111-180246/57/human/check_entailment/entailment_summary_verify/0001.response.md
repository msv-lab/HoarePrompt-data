### Reasoning:

Let's carefully review the provided program against the problem statement and the function summaries.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts with `k = 2` and iterates through potential values of `k` until `2 * k - 2 > n`.
2. **Cycle Length Calculation**: `cycle_length = 2 * k - 2` is correct and represents the length of the repeating cycle.
3. **Position in Cycle**: The position within the current cycle is calculated as `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`, which is correct.
4. **Expected Number Calculation**:
   - If the position is within the first `k` elements of the cycle (`position_in_cycle <= k`), the expected number is `position_in_cycle`.
   - Otherwise, the expected number is `2 * k - position_in_cycle`.
5. **Check Condition**: If the expected number matches `x`, `count` is incremented.
6. **Increment K**: `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
7. **Return Count**: The function returns the count of valid `k`.

This part of the implementation seems correct. However, let's verify the logic again for completeness.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the input correctly and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Number of Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases `t`.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts `n` and `x`, and calls `func_1` with these values.
4. **Store Results**: The result of `func_1` for each test case is stored in the `results` list.
5. **Output Results**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

This part of the implementation also seems correct.

#### Verification:
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases like `k = 2` and larger values of `k` within the specified constraints.
- **Logic Consistency**: The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the expected number based on the position in the cycle and checks if it matches `x`.
- **Loop Boundaries**: The loop in `func_1` iterates through possible values of `k` until the cycle length exceeds `n`.
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case appropriately.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all aspects of the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
