Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the position `x` is greater than `k`. Specifically, the logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It calculates the `expected_number` based on the position within the cycle but does not properly account for the repeating pattern of the settling process.

For example, consider the input `100 99`. According to the problem description, there should be no valid `k` since `x = 99` would require `k` to be at least 100, which is not possible within the cycle length. However, the program incorrectly returns 0 for this case because it does not properly handle the logic to determine if `x` can fit within any valid `k`.

A correct implementation should ensure that the `expected_number` calculation is consistent with the settling pattern and that the loop correctly identifies all valid `k` values.
