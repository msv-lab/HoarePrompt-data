### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `count` to 0 and sets `k` to 2.
2. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `2 * k - 2` is less than or equal to `n`. This ensures that we check all possible cycles up to the maximum length that fits within `n`.
3. **Cycle Length Calculation**: `cycle_length` is set to `2 * k - 2`. This is the length of the repeating cycle.
4. **Position in Cycle**: The position within the current cycle is calculated using `(n - 1) % cycle_length + 1`. This correctly identifies the position within the cycle.
5. **Expected Number Calculation**: Depending on whether the position is within the first `k` or the second part of the cycle, the expected number `expected_number` is determined. Specifically:
   - If `position_in_cycle` is within the first `k` positions, `expected_number` is `position_in_cycle`.
   - Otherwise, `expected_number` is `2 * k - position_in_cycle`, which correctly maps the position in the second part of the cycle back to the expected value.
6. **Check Condition**: If `expected_number` matches `x`, `count` is incremented.
7. **Increment K**: `k` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
8. **Return Count**: Finally, the function returns the count of valid `k`.

The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies the expected number based on the position within the cycle and checks if it matches `x`.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings. This handles the input reading part correctly.
2. **Number of Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases `t`.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts `n` and `x`, and calls `func_1` with these values.
4. **Store Results**: The result of `func_1` for each test case is stored in the `results` list.
5. **Output Results**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The handling of input and output in `func_2` is correct and follows the problem statement requirements.

### Verification:
- **Logic Check**: The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the expected number based on the position in the cycle and checks if it matches `x`.
- **Loop Boundaries**: The loop in `func_1` iterates through possible values of `k` until the cycle length exceeds `n`.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases like `k = 2` correctly.
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case appropriately.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all aspects of the problem statement. The provided examples also confirm the correctness of the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the program as being correct. There are no logical errors or missing edge cases identified in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description.
