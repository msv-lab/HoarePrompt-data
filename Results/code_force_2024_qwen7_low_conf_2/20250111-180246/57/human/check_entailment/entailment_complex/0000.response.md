Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly initializes the variables and enters a while loop to iterate over possible values of `k` until `2 * k - 2` exceeds `n`.
   - It calculates the `cycle_length` as `2 * k - 2` and `position_in_cycle` as `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1`.
   - Depending on the value of `position_in_cycle`, it computes `expected_number` to be either `position_in_cycle` or `2 * k - position_in_cycle`.
   - If `expected_number` matches `x`, it increments the `count` variable.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is less than 4 by only entering the loop when `n` is at least 4.
   - After the loop, it returns `count`, which is the number of valid `k` values.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It parses the test cases by iterating through the list and calling `func_1` for each pair of `n` and `x`.
   - The results of `func_1` for each test case are stored in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and constraints as specified.

Given that both functions handle their respective tasks accurately and follow the logic required to solve the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
