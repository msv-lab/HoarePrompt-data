The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x`. It then calls another function `func_1` with these integers for each test case, storing the results in a list. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for all test cases. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and follows the specified constraints (i.e., `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`). If there are more than 100 test cases, the behavior is undefined. The function does not handle any missing or invalid input gracefully.
