The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, then calls the function `func_1(n, x)` to compute a result. These results are stored in a list called `results`. After all iterations are completed, the function prints each result in the `results` list. The function itself does not return any value. If `t` is out of the range `[1, 100]` or if `x` is not strictly less than `n`, the behavior is undefined since no checks are performed in the given code.
