You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    (l, r) = (1, n)
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i, n, k):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                ans[j] = l
                l += 1
            else:
                ans[j] = r
                r -= 1
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(n\) and \(k\) where \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(k\) is even. For each test case, it initializes a list `ans` of length \(n\) with all elements set to 0. It then uses a nested loop to fill the list `ans` based on the values of `i` and `j`. Specifically, for each \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\) with a step size of \(k\), if \(i\) is even, the corresponding element in `ans` at index \(j\) is set to \(l\), and \(l\) is incremented by 1. If \(i\) is odd, the corresponding element in `ans` at index \(j\) is set to \(r\), and \(r\) is decremented by 1. After processing all test cases, the function prints the contents of `ans`.

The function handles the following edge cases:
1. If \(k = 2\), the loop will iterate over every other index, setting alternate elements in `ans` to `l` and `r`.
2. If \(k = n\), the loop will only run once, setting the first element in `ans` to `l` and the last element to `r`.
3. If \(n = 2 \cdot 10^5\), the function will handle the maximum possible value for \(n\).

However, the function does not handle the case where the input does not meet the specified constraints, such as \(n < 2\) or \(k\) being odd. Additionally, the function does not validate the input within the specified range, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is out of bounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program aims to construct a k-level permutation of length n. Let's analyze its logic and correctness step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Reading Input**: Inside the loop, it reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the smallest and largest values that can be used in the permutation, respectively. These are set to 1 and `n`, respectively.
4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The outer loop runs `k` times, setting the starting index `j` for each segment of length `k`.
   - For each segment, depending on whether the current index `i` (outer loop counter) is even or odd, it assigns either the smallest available value (`l`) or the largest available value (`r`).
   - If `i` is even, it assigns `l` to the current position and increments `l`.
   - If `i` is odd, it assigns `r` to the current position and decrements `r`.
   - This ensures that the values alternate between increasing and decreasing, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the constructed permutation.

Given the constraints and the logic, this approach should generate a valid k-level permutation for any valid input. Each segment sum will be either `l + (l + 1) + ... + (l + k/2 - 1)` or `r + (r - 1) + ... + (r - k/2 + 1)`, which ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum segment sums is at most 1.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
