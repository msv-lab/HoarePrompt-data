Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Constraints**: The program correctly handles the constraints specified in the problem:
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - \(k\) is even

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes the values of \(n\) and \(k\) from the input, ensuring that these values are within the specified ranges.
   - It initializes an array `ans` of size \(n\) with zeros.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the array `ans` according to the given conditions:
     - If \(i \mod 2 == 0\), it assigns the value of `l` to the corresponding index in `ans` and increments `l`.
     - If \(i \mod 2 != 0\), it assigns the value of `r` to the corresponding index in `ans` and decrements `r`.

3. **Logic for Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The outer loop iterates over \(i\) from \(0\) to \(k-1\).
   - The inner loop iterates over `j` starting from `i` and increments by `k` until `j` reaches `n`.
   - This ensures that each segment of length `k` in the permutation is filled correctly.

4. **Ensuring the K-Level Property**:
   - The construction of the permutation ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will have a difference of at most 1.
   - This is because the values are assigned alternately between `l` and `r`, incrementing `l` and decrementing `r` in each iteration. This ensures that the maximum and minimum values in any segment of length `k` will not differ by more than 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

Given the above points, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
