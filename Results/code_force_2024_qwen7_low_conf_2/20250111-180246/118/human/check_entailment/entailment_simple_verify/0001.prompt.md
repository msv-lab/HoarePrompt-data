You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program aims to construct a k-level permutation of length n. Let's analyze its logic and correctness step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Reading Input**: Inside the loop, it reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
3. **Initialization**: It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the smallest and largest values that can be used in the permutation, respectively. These are set to 1 and `n`, respectively.
4. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The outer loop runs `k` times, setting the starting index `j` for each segment of length `k`.
   - For each segment, depending on whether the current index `i` (outer loop counter) is even or odd, it assigns either the smallest available value (`l`) or the largest available value (`r`).
   - If `i` is even, it assigns `l` to the current position and increments `l`.
   - If `i` is odd, it assigns `r` to the current position and decrements `r`.
   - This ensures that the values alternate between increasing and decreasing, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the constructed permutation.

Given the constraints and the logic, this approach should generate a valid k-level permutation for any valid input. Each segment sum will be either `l + (l + 1) + ... + (l + k/2 - 1)` or `r + (r - 1) + ... + (r - k/2 + 1)`, which ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum segment sums is at most 1.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
