The code `o.append(s)` appends the value of `s` to the list `o`. Since `o` was not defined in the initial state, it will be created as an empty list initially. The value of `s` is given as `s - l`, but since `l` is undefined, the value of `s` remains as `s - l`.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is undefined, `m` is undefined, `o` is `[s - l]`, `s` is `s - l` and `l` is undefined.**
