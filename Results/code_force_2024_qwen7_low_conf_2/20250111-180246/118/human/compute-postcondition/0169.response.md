According to the given for loop, the loop can execute as long as the variable `y` is within the range defined by `b`. The key variables here are `b`, `y`, and the loop's range.

Given the initial states:
- `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.
- `s` is the value of `b`.
- `m` is `0`.
- `o` is an empty list.
- `f` is `0`.
- `l` is `0`.

For the loop `for y in range(b):` to execute, the following conditions must hold:
- `b` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(b)` requires `b` to be a non-negative integer).
- `y` should start from 0 and go up to `b-1` during the loop iterations.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `b` is a non-negative integer because the loop relies on this value to determine its range. Since `b` is already described as an input integer, we only need to ensure that it is non-negative.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `b` must be a non-negative integer.

The other variables (`a`, `c`, `h`, `s`, `m`, `o`, `f`, `l`, and `y`) are either not directly involved in the loop condition or their values are set to specific values before the loop starts.
