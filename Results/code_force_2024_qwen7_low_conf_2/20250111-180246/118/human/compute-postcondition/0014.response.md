`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `i`, `k`, `n`, `j`, and `ans[j]` remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `ans[j]` is assigned the value `l`, so after incrementing `l` by 1, `ans[j]` will also reflect this change.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or a value such that `j + k < n`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `ans[j]` is assigned the value `l + 1`.**
