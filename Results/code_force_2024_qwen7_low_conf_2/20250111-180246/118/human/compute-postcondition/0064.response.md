`l` is incremented by 1. Initially, `l` is `k` or 1 less than its initial value. After incrementing, `l` becomes `k+1` or 2 less than its initial value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + 2k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is greater than 1 + 2k, `l` is `k+1` or 2 less than its initial value, `r` is either 1 more than its initial value or 1 less than its initial value, `ans` is [l].

Output State: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + 2k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is greater than 1 + 2k, `l` is `k+1` or 2 less than its initial value, `r` is either 1 more than its initial value or 1 less than its initial value, `ans` is [l]**.
