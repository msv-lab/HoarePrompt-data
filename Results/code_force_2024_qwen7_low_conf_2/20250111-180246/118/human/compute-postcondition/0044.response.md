`r` is decremented by 1. Since `k` is a positive even integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and `l` is equal to `r`, and `ans[j]` is equal to `r`, the value of `r` is updated, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `k`, `l` is equal to `r-1`, `ans[j]` is equal to `r-1`, `r` is decreased by 1**
