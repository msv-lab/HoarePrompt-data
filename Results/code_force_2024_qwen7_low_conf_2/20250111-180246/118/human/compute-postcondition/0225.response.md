`s` is decremented by `l`. The value of `l` is not specified in the initial state, so we will keep it as `l`. The value of `b` and `y` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`; `s` is decreased by `l`.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`; `s` is decreased by `l`.**
