Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States
- `i` is 0
- `k` is a non-negative even integer
- `n` is greater than 0
- `j` is either 0 or a value such that `j + k < n`
- `ans[j]` is either `l + 1` if `i % 2 == 0`, or `r - 1` if `i % 2 != 0`

### For Loop
The loop iterates over `j` with the following conditions:
- Start from `i`
- Increment by `k`
- Stop before reaching `n`

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0 (initial value)
- `k` is a non-negative even integer
- `n` is greater than 0
- `j` is either 0 or a value such that `j + k < n`
- `ans[j]` is already updated based on the value of `i`

### Determining the Next State
To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to:
1. Determine the new value of `i`.
2. Ensure that the condition `j + k < n` holds for the next value of `j`.

Given that `i` is initially 0 and `k` is a non-negative even integer, the first possible value for `j` is `0` (since `j` is either 0 or a value such that `j + k < n`).

Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `j` by `k`, the next value of `j` would be `0 + k = k`.

### Adjusted States
- `i` will increase by `k` (since `i` was 0, it becomes `k`)
- `k` remains a non-negative even integer
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `j` will now be `k` (since `j` started as 0 and incremented by `k`)
- `ans[j]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `k`)

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[k]` is either `l + 1` if `i % 2 == 0`, or `r - 1` if `i % 2 != 0`.**

Note: Since `i` is now `k`, the condition `i % 2 == 0` or `i % 2 != 0` will determine the value of `ans[k]`.
