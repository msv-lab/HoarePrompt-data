Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1 less than its initial value, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, `ans` is an empty list. If `i` is even, `l` is reset to its initial value. Otherwise, `r` is unchanged and `i` is not an even number, `j` is undefined.***
