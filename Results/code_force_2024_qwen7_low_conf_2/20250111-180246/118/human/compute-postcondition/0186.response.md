`f` is incremented by 1, changing its value from being less than 0 to now being -1 (since it was initially less than 0 and has been incremented by 1). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, and `y` is not divisible by `c`; `s` is decreased by `l`, `o` is a list containing `s`, `f` is -1**
