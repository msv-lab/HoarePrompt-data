Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `s - l`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`, `f` is either 0, 1, or 2, `l` is either -1 or decreased by 2 from its original value, `y` is 1, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `l` is greater than 2, `l` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.***
