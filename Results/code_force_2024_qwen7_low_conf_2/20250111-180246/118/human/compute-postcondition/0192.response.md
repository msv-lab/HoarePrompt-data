Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer and not divisible by `c`, `s` is decreased by `l`, `o` is a list containing the new value of `s`, and `l` is odd. The current value of `f` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l` is even and greater than 2, `l` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, the value of `l` remains unchanged.***
