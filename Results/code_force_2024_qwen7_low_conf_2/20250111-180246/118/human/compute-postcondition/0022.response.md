`r` is decremented by 1, so `r` becomes `r - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[k]` is `r - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[k]` is `r - 1`.**
