Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is `[b]`, `f` is either `0` or `1`, `l` is `0` or decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is `b - 1`, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `l % 2 == 0`, `l` is the current value of `l` - 1 or remains unchanged based on the value of `f`; otherwise, `f` is `1` and `l` is `0` or decreased by 1.***
