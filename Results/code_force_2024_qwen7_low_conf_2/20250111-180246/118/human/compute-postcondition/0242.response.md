The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs within its scope. The constraints and relationships indicate that the function will handle test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` (with specific conditions on their values). The function will return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts test cases consisting of integers `n` and `k`, where `1 <= t <= 10^4` is the number of test cases, each `n` satisfies `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` with `k` being even, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. It returns a result based on the given `n` and `k` for each test case.**
