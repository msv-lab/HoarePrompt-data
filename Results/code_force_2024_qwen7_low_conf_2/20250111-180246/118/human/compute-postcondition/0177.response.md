`s` is decremented by `l`. The value of `b` and `y` remains unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. The value of `s` is updated by subtracting `l` from its current value.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, and `y` is not divisible by `c`; `s` is decreased by `l`.**
