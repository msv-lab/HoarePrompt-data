`l` is decremented by 1. The value of `l` was either 0 or had been decreased by at most 1 from its original value. After decrementing, `l` will now be either -1 (if it was originally 0) or decreased by 2 from its original value (if it was already -1 or less). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `s - l`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`, `f` is either 0, 1, or 2, `l` is either -1 or decreased by 2 from its original value, `y` is 1, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.**
