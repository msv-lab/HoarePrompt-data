`l` is incremented by 1. The value of `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[j]` is `l`. The output state is: `i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[j]` is `l + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[j]` is `l + 1`**
