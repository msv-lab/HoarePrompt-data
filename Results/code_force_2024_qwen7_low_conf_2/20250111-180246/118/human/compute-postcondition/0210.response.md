`f` is incremented by 1. The value of `b`, `y`, `m`, `o`, `s`, and `l` remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is equal to the initial value of `f` plus 1, `m` is undefined, `o` is `[s - l]`, `s` is `s - l`, and `l` is undefined.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is equal to the initial value of `f` plus 1, `m` is undefined, `o` is `[s - l]`, `s` is `s - l`, and `l` is undefined.**
