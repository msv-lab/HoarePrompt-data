Postcondition: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is either k or 1 less than its initial value, `r` is either 1 more than its initial value or 1 less than its initial value, `ans` is a list with one element where if `i % 2 == 0`, then `ans[j]` equals `l`; otherwise, `ans[j]` equals `k + 2`**
