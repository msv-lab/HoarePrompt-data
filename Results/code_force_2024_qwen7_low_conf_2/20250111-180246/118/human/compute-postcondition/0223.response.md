The code `l = h` assigns the value of `h` to `l`. However, since there is no initial value given for `h`, we cannot determine what `l` is specifically. The values of the other variables (`b`, `y`, `f`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`; `f` is `0`, `s` is `b - (m + 1)`, `l` is equal to `h`**.
