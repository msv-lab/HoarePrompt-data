Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b - l`, `m` is either 0, 1, or 2, `o` is a list containing `[b, s, s]`, `f` is either 0 or 1 based on the evenness of `l` after the if-else block executes, `l` is either -1 or less than the original value, and `y` is 2 and divisible by `c` if the if condition is true for the next iteration, otherwise `y` is 2 and not divisible by `c`.*** 

Explanation:
- The if part states that if `l > 2`, then `l` is set to a value less than or equal to -1 (meaning it decreases from its current value to a value less than or equal to -1).
- The else part does not change the values of any variables, so it doesn't alter the postcondition.
- Therefore, the overall postcondition combines both scenarios, indicating that if the if condition is met (`l > 2`), `l` becomes less than or equal to -1, while `y` becomes 2 and divisible by `c` for the next iteration. If the if condition is not met, the original values of `l` and `y` are maintained.
