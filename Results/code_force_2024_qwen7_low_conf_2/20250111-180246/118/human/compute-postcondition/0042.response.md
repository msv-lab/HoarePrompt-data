The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Given that `k` is a positive even integer, `j` is equal to `k`, and the operation only affects `l`, the updated state for `l` is `l + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `k`, `l` is `l + 1`, and `r` is not modified if `j % 2 == 0**
