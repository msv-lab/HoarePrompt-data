Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `s - l`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`, `f` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `l` is either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is 1, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `f` is non-negative (`f >= 0`), then `l` is decreased by 2 if it is greater than 2, otherwise `l` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `f` is either 1, 2, or 3, `l` is either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value.***
