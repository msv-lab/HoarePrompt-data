Postcondition: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is adjusted based on `y % c == 0`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `o` is a list containing `[b, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 2]`, `f` is either 0, 1, or 2, `l` is either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is 0, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `y % c == 0`, then `s` is `b - m` and `m` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is `b - l`, `m` is either 0 or 1, and if `l > 2` and `f >= 1`, then `l` is decreased by at most 1.**
