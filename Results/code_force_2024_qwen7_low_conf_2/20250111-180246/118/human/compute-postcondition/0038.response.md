`r` is decremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `ans` is undefined, `j` is undefined.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `ans` is undefined, `j` is undefined**
