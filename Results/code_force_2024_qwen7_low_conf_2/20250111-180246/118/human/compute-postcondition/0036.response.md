The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `i` is 0
- `k` is a positive even integer
- `n` is a positive integer
- `l` is incremented by 1 (specifically, `l` now equals the original value of `l` plus 1)
- `l_new` is assigned to `ans[j]`
- `r` is not modified

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `l` is the original value of `l` plus 1, `l_new` is assigned to `ans[j]`, `r` is not modified**
