Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b`, `f` is either 0 or -1, `m` is the number of times `y` is divisible by `c`, `s` is `b - m`, `l` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, and `o` is a list containing all intermediate values of `s` calculated during the loop iterations.**
