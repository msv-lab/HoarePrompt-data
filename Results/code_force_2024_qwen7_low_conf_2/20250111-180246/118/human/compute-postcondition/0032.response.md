`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` is 0 (which is even, contradicting the initial state that `i` is not even, but this will be updated), `k` is a positive even integer, and `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the updated value of `r` is `r - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `r` is `r - 1`**
