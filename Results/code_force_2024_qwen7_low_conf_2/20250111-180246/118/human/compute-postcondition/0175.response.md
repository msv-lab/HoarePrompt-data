The code `o.append(s)` attempts to append the value of `s` to the list `o`. However, in the initial state, `s` is undefined, meaning it does not exist. Since `s` is undefined, we cannot append it to the list `o`. Therefore, the list `o` remains unchanged, and the variables `b`, `y`, `c`, `f`, `m`, `s`, and `l` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `f` is 0, `m` is 1, `s` is undefined, `l` is undefined, `o` is an empty list**
