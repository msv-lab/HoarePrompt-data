Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1; `b` must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`; `s` is `s - l`; `m` is either 1 or 2; `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`; `f` is either 0, 1, or 2; `l` is -1 or 0; `y` is 1; and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. Since the condition `l > 2` is not met, the else part does not execute, and the variables remain as described in the if part.***
