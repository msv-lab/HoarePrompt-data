`m` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `m` is `0`, so now `m` is `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is 1, `o` is an empty list, `f` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `y` is `b` and was previously `b - 1`**
