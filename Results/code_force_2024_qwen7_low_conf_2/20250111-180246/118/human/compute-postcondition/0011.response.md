Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is 0 (which it always is in this case) and `i % 2 == 0`, then `l` is incremented by 1. Since no other valid initial state exists for the else part due to the contradiction in the condition `i % 2` being not equal to 0 when `i` is 0, `r` is decreased by 1.***
