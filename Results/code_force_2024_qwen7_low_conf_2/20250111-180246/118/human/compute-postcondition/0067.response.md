Postcondition: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + 2k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is greater than 1 + 2k, `l` is `k+1` or 2 less than its initial value, `r` is either 1 more than its initial value or 1 less than its initial value, `ans` is a list with one element where if `i % 2 == 0`, then `ans[j]` equals `l`; otherwise, `ans[j]` equals `k + 2`. If `i % 2 == 0`, `l` is `k+1` or 2 less than its initial value; otherwise, `l` is either `k` or 1 less than its initial value, and `r` is either 1 more than its initial value or 1 less than its initial value.**
