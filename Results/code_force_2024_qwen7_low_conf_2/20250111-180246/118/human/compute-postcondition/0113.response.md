The value of `f` is set to 0, which changes its previous state. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is `[b]`, `f` is `0`, `l` is 1 (decreased by 1 from the original value which was greater than 2), `y` is `b - 1`, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`**
