To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given for loop statement and analyze the conditions under which it will run.

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(i, n, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given the initial states:
- `i` is 0
- `k` is a non-negative even integer
- `n` is a positive integer

For the for loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
1. The starting value `i` must be less than the ending value `n`.
2. The step value `k` must be a positive integer (since `k` is a non-negative even integer and it cannot be zero for the loop to execute).

Let's verify these points:

1. **Starting value (`i`) and ending value (`n`)**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` (which is 0) must be less than `n`.

2. **Step value (`k`)**:
   - `k` is a non-negative even integer.
   - Since `k` is a non-negative even integer, it must be at least 2 to ensure the loop progresses (it cannot be 0, as this would result in an infinite loop or no loop at all).
   - Therefore, `k` must be a positive even integer (e.g., 2, 4, 6, ...).

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the initial states to ensure they meet the requirements for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted States
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- `k` must be a positive even integer.

Since `i` is already 0 and `n` is a positive integer, `i < n` will always be true if `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the only additional state we need to ensure is that `k` is a positive even integer.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer**
