Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs over the range from 0 to `b-1`. This means the loop variable `y` will iterate through each integer from 0 to `b-1`.

2. **Understand the Initial States**: 
   - `b` is a non-negative integer.
   - `y` is an integer, and it is currently the value that caused the last iteration of the loop.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `y` needs to be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range [0, b-1].
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `y + 1`.

Given the conditions provided, we need to ensure that `y` is in the range [0, b-1] for the next iteration. If `y` is equal to `b-1`, then the loop will terminate.

So, for the next iteration to occur, `y` must be less than `b-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `y` is the loop variable, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `y + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `y` is still within the valid range, i.e., `y < b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `b` remains unchanged as it defines the upper bound of the loop.
- `y` is incremented by 1.
- `f`, `m`, `s`, and `l` remain undefined or their values are dependent on the new value of `y`.

The updated state is:
State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is undefined, `m` is undefined, `s` is undefined, and `l` is undefined.**
