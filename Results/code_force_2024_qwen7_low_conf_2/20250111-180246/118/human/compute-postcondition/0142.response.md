The value of `m` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 1 or 2 to either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is either `b - 1` or `b - 2`, `m` is either 2 or 3, `o` is a list containing `[b, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 2]`, `f` is 0, `l` is either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is 1, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.**
