The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k`. The initial state is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This initial state is not directly affected by the input operation, so it remains unchanged.

After the execution of the code, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers inputted, ensuring that `k` is even and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer read from input and `k` is an even integer read from input with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)**
