Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by `l`, and `o` is a list containing `[s]`. If `f` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is further decreased by an additional amount if `l > 2`, otherwise, no additional change is applied to `s`. If `f` is less than 0, `f` is increased by 1.***
