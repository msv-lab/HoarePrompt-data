Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by `l`, and `o` is a list containing `[s]`. If `l` is even, `s` is further decreased by an additional amount if `l > 2` and either `f` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is decreased by 1 if `f` is less than 0 and `f` is increased by 1, or `f` is 0 and `s` is not changed. If `l` is odd, `f` is incremented by 1 and `s` remains unchanged.***
