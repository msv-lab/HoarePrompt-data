`ans[j]` is assigned the value `r`. Since `j` is equal to `k`, and `k` is a non-negative even integer, the value of `ans[j]` (which is the same as `ans[k]`) changes to `r`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `k`, and `ans[k]` is `r`.**
