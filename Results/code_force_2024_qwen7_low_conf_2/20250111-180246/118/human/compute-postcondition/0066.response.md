`r` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `r` was either `k` + 1 or `k` - 1. Since `k` is a positive even integer, the new value of `r` will be either `k` or `k` - 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + 2k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1 + 2k, `l` is either k or 1 less than its initial value, `r` is either `k` or `k` - 2, `ans` is a list with one element where `ans[j]` is `r`.**
