`r` is decremented by 1. The value of `i`, `k`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or a value such that `j + k < n`, `ans[j]` is `r - 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is either 0 or a value such that `j + k < n`, `ans[j]` is `r - 1`**
