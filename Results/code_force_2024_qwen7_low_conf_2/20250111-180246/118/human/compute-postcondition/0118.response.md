Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is either `0` or `1`, `o` is a list containing `[b]` or `[b]` appended to an existing list, `f` is either `0` or `1`, `l` is either `0` or decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is `b - 1`, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `y % c == 0`, then `m` is `1` and `o` is a list containing `[b]`. Otherwise, `m` is `0` and `o` is a list containing `[b]` or has `[b]` appended to it, `f` is `0` or `1`, and `l` is either `0` or decreased by at most 1 from its original value based on the value of `f` and the parity of `l`.***
