Postcondition: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b - l`, `m` is either 0, 1, or 2, `o` is a list containing `[b, s, s]`, `f` is either 0 or incremented by 1, `l` is either 0 or greater than 2 based on the evenness of `l` after the if-else block executes, and `y` is 2 and divisible by `c` if the if condition is true for the next iteration, otherwise `y` is 2 and not divisible by `c`.**
