The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly in the provided code snippet. Instead, it appears to handle test cases internally, where each test case involves parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even.

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement but rather inferred from the constraints, the function likely processes these parameters and returns some form of result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but processes test cases with parameters `n` and `k`, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is even.**
