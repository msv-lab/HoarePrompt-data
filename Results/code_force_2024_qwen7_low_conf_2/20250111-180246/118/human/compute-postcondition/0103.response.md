Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is `[b]`, `f` is `0`, `l` is the current value of `l` - 1, `y` is `b - 1`, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, and `y % c != 0`.***

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `l` is currently an even number and greater than 2 (since the if condition checks `l > 2`).
- If `l > 2`, then `l` is decremented by 1 (`l = l - 1`), and this value remains even as it is still greater than 2.
- There is no change in the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `h`, `s`, `m`, `o`, `f`, `y`, and `h` in the if part other than the decrement of `l` by 1.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition simply reflects the changes made in the if part while retaining all other variables' values as per the precondition.
