`l` is incremented by 1. Since `l` was initially 1 less than its initial value, it now becomes its initial value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only affects `l`. The conditions for `k`, `n`, `r`, and `ans` remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1 less than its initial value, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, `ans` is an empty list, `l` is now its initial value**
