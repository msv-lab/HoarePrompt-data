`l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 0 and since `i` modulo 2 equals 0, this condition is satisfied. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as there is no operation on them. The value of `n` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `i` modulo 2 equals 0; `l` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `i` modulo 2 equals 0; `l` is incremented by 1**
