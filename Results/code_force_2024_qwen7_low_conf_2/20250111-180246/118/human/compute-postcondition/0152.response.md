`l` is decremented by 1. Since `l` is originally either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value, after decrementing, `l` is now either -1 (if it was originally 0) or 0 (if it was originally 1 or more). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer greater than 1; `b` must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`; `s` is `s - l`; `m` is either 1 or 2; `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`; `f` is either 0, 1, or 2; `l` is -1 or 0; `y` is 1; and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1; `b` must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`; `s` is `s - l`; `m` is either 1 or 2; `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`; `f` is either 0, 1, or 2; `l` is -1 or 0; `y` is 1; and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.**
