`f` is incremented by 1. The value of `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by `l`, and `o` is a list containing `[s]`. No other changes are made to the variables.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by `l`, `f` is incremented by 1, `o` is a list containing `[s]`**
