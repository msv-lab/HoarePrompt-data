Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer. If `i` % 2 == 0, then `l` is the original value of `l` plus 1, `l_new` is assigned to `ans[j]`, and `r` is not modified. Otherwise, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `ans` is undefined, and `j` is undefined.***
