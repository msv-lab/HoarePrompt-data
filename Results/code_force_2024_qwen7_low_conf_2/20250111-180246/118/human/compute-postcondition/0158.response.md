Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is adjusted based on the condition `y % c == 0`. If `y % c == 0`, then `s` is either `b - 1` or `b - 2`, `m` is either 2 or 3, `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, s]` or `[b, b - 2, s]`, `f` is 0, and `l` is equal to `h`. If `y % c != 0`, then `s` is `s - l`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `o` is a list containing either `[b, b - 1, b - 1]` or `[b, b - 1, b - 2]`, `f` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `l` is either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value. Additionally, if `f` is non-negative (`f >= 0`), then `l` is decreased by 2 if it is greater than 2, otherwise `l` remains unchanged. If `f` is negative (`f < 0`), then `l` is either 0 or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value.***
