The code `print(*o)` simply prints the elements of the list `o`. The list `o` contains all intermediate values of `s` calculated during the loop iterations. Since no loop is present in the given code snippet, `o` remains empty. Therefore, the print statement will print nothing.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b`, `f` is either 0 or -1, `m` is the number of times `y` is divisible by `c`, `s` is `b - m`, `l` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, and `o` is an empty list.**
