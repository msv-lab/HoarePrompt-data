`r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, so the new value of `r` is now 1 less than its initial value. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1 less than its initial value, `r` is 1 less than its initial value, `ans` is a list with one element where `ans[1 + k] = k + 2`**
