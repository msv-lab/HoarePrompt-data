Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `a` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.
   - `s` is `b`.
   - `m` is `0`.
   - `o` is an empty list.
   - `f` is `0`.
   - `l` is `0`.
   - `y` is `b - 1` and has been updated to the new value `b` from the input.
   - `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for y in range(b):`.
   - The `range(b)` function generates integers starting from `0` up to `b-1`.

3. **Ensuring the Loop Executes:**
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must be greater than 0 because `range(b)` will generate a sequence only if `b` is a positive integer.

4. **States to Adjust:**
   - Since `y` is updated to `b` after the loop starts, the loop itself will run until `y` reaches `b-1`. Therefore, we need to ensure `b` is a positive integer to allow the loop to run correctly.
   - No other state needs adjustment as the loop logic does not depend on the values of `a`, `c`, `h`, `s`, `m`, `o`, `f`, or `l`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `b` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is an empty list, `f` is `0`, `l` is `0`, `y` is `b` and was previously `b - 1`, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`**
