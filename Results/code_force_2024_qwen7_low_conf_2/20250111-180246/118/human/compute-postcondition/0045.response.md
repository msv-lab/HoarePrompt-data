Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is equal to `k`, `l` is updated as follows: if `j % 2 == 0`, then `l` is `l + 1`; otherwise, `l` is `r - 1`, and `r` is either not modified or decreased by 1, depending on the condition `j % 2 == 0`. Additionally, if `j % 2 == 0`, `ans[j]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans[j]` is set to `r - 1`.***
