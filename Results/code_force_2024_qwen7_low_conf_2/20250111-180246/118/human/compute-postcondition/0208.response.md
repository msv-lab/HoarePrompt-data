Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer less than `b-1`, `f` and `m` are undefined, `o` and `s` remain as `[s - l]` and `s - l` respectively, `l` is `initial_l - 1`. If `l` is greater than 2, the function does nothing. If `l` is not greater than 2, the function also does nothing.***
