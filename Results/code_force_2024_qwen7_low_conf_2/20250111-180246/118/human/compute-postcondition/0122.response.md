`m` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 0 or 1 to 1 or 2, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b - m`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `o` is a list containing `[b]` or \([b]\) appended to an existing list, `f` is `0`, `l` is either `0` or decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is `0`, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.**
