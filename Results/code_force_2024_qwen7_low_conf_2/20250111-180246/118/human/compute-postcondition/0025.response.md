Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `i` is `k`, where `k` is a non-negative even integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `j` ranges from `i` to `n-1` with a step size of `k`.
   - For every `j` such that `j = i, i+k, i+2k, ..., n-1-k` (if applicable), `ans[j]` is `l + 1` if `i % 2 == 0`, and `ans[j]` is `r - 1` if `i % 2 != 0`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `k-1`. Since the previous iteration had `i = k`, the next iteration should start with `i = 0`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` needs to be reset to `0`.
   - `n` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.
   - `k` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is a positive integer**
