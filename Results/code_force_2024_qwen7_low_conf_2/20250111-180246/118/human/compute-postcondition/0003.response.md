Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer read from input and satisfies \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k` is an even integer read from input.
   - `l` is 1.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, inclusive. Therefore, `k` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `k-1` during each iteration. Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is within this range.
   - Since `k` is an even integer, we don't need to adjust its value, but we need to ensure it is indeed an even number.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < k`.

Given these points, we need to ensure the following conditions hold true before the loop starts:
- `i` must be less than `k`.
- `k` must be a non-negative even integer.

Based on the initial states and the loop condition:
- We already know `k` is an even integer read from input, so no adjustment is needed for `k` being even.
- We need to ensure `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value of the loop).

So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `k` must be a non-negative even integer.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a non-negative even integer**
