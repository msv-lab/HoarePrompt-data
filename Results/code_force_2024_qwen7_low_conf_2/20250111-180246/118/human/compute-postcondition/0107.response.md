Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is `[b]`, `y` is `b - 1`, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `f >= 0`, then `l` is the current value of `l` - 1. If `f < 0`, then `f` is `1` and `l` is `0`.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
