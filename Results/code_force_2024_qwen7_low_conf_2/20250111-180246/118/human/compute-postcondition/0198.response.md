Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer. If `y` is divisible by `c`, then `f` is 0, `m` is 1, `s` is undefined, and `l` is undefined. If `y` is not divisible by `c`, then `s` is decreased by `l`, `o` is a list containing the new value of `s`, and `f` is either 0 or -1 depending on the parity of `l`. Specifically, if `l` is even, `l` is decreased by 1 and `f` is set to 0. If `l` is odd, `f` is incremented by 1 if `f` is 0, otherwise `f` remains 0.***
