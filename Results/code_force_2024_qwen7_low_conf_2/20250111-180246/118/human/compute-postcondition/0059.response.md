`ans[j]` is assigned the value of `r`. Given that `j` is equal to `1 + k` and `r` is 1 more than its initial value, we know that `ans[1 + k]` will be set to a value of `1 + k + 1 = k + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1 less than its initial value, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, `ans` is a list with one element where `ans[1 + k] = k + 2`.

Output State: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1 less than its initial value, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, `ans` is a list with one element where `ans[1 + k] = k + 2`**
