Postcondition: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`. If `y % c == 0`, then `f` is `0`, `s` is `b - (m + 1)`, `l` is equal to `h`, and `o` is a list with one element `b - (m + 1)` appended to it. Otherwise, `s` is decreased by `l`, and `o` is a list containing `[s]`. If `l` is even and `l > 2` and either `f` is greater than or equal to 0, `s` is decreased by 1 if `f` is less than 0 and `f` is increased by 1, or `f` is 0 and `s` is not changed. If `l` is odd, `f` is incremented by 1 and `s` remains unchanged.**
