Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer less than `b-1`, `f` is either the initial value of `f` plus 1 or 0, `m` is undefined, `o` is `[s - l]`, `s` is `s - l`, and `l` is undefined or `initial_l - 1`. If `l` is greater than 2, no changes are made; otherwise, `f` remains unchanged at its initial value plus 1.***
