The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `r`. The only new variable created is `ans`, which is a list of `n` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer read from input and \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `k` is an even integer read from input; `l` is 1; `r` is `n`; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**
