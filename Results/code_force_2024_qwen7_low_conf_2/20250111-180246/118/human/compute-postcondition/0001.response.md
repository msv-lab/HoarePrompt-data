The code initializes two variables `l` and `r` with the values 1 and `n`, respectively. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not affected. After executing the code, the values of `l` and `r` are set to 1 and `n`, respectively.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer read from input and `k` is an even integer read from input with \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `l` is 1; `r` is `n`**
