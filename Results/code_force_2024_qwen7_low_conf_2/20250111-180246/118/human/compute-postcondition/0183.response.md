Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, and `y` is not divisible by `c`; `s` is decreased by `l`, `o` is a list containing `s`, the value of `l` is even and now `l -= 1`, and the value of `f` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l > 2`, then `l` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables' states.***
