Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a positive integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is the final value of `b - m`, `m` is the total number of times `y % c == 0` is true, `o` is a list of length `b + 1` containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, `f` is the accumulated value determined by the conditions inside the loop, and `l` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop. The list `o` is printed.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `a` is a positive integer.
   - `b` and `c` are integers provided as input.
   - `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.
   - `s`, `m`, `o`, `f`, and `l` are initialized to 0, an empty list, and 0 respectively.

2. **First Loop (`for _ in range(a):`)**:
   - This loop runs `a` times.
   - Inside this loop, `b` and `c` are read as input, and the operations inside the nested loop modify `s`, `m`, `o`, `f`, and `l`.

3. **Nested Loop (`for y in range(b):`)**:
   - This loop runs `b` times.
   - For each `y`:
     - If `y % c == 0`, `s` is updated to `b - m`, `m` is incremented, `l` is set to `h`, and `s` is appended to `o`.
     - Otherwise, `s` is decremented by `l` and then appended to `o`.
     - Conditions on `f` and `l` are checked and adjusted accordingly.

4. **Final Values**:
   - After all iterations of both loops, `a` remains the same.
   - `b` and `c` are the inputs provided in the last iteration of the outer loop.
   - `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`.
   - `s` is the final value of `b - m`.
   - `m` is the total number of times `y % c == 0` was true.
   - `o` is a list of length `b + 1` containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `f` is the accumulated value determined by the conditions inside the loop.
   - `l` is the value determined by the conditions inside the loop.

5. **Output**:
   - The list `o` is printed after the loops complete.
