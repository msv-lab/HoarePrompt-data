To ensure the loop executes according to the given for loop statement, we need to consider the conditions specified within the loop's range: `range(i, n, k)`.

1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `j = i`.
   - Given that `i` is initially 1, this part is already correct for the loop to start.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop should continue as long as `j < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `i` (which is 1).

3. **Variable `k`:**
   - The loop increments `j` by `k` each iteration.
   - Since `k` is a positive even integer, `k` must be greater than 0 and even.

4. **Initial value of `l`:**
   - `l` is described as being "the initial value of `l` minus 1".
   - This implies that `l` must be initialized before the loop starts. We need to adjust the state to reflect this.

5. **Initial value of `r`:**
   - `r` is described as being "the initial value of `r` plus 1".
   - This implies that `r` must be initialized before the loop starts. We need to adjust the state to reflect this.

6. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is an empty list, which is already correctly stated.

Based on the above considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` must be initialized and is 1 less than its initial value, `r` must be initialized and is 1 more than its initial value, `ans` is an empty list**
