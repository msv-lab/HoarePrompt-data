Postcondition: **`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b - l`, `m` is either `0` or `1`, `o` is a list containing `[b, s]` or `[b]` appended with `s`, `f` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`, `l` is either `0` or has been decreased by at most 1 from its original value, `y` is `0`, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `l > 2` and `f >= 0`, then `l` is decreased to its minimum possible value. Otherwise, no changes occur if `f < 0`.**
