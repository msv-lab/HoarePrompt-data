The value of `l` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` modulo 2 is 0, which means `i` is even. Since the values of `k` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `i` modulo 2 is 0; `l` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative even integer, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `i` modulo 2 is 0; `l` is incremented by 1**
