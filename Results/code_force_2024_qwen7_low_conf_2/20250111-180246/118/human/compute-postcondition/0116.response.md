Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer greater than 1, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`, `s` is `b`, `m` is `0`, `o` is `[b]`, `f` is either `0` or `1`, `l` is `0` or decreased by 1 from its original value which was greater than 2, `y` is `b - 1`, and `h` is the ceiling value of `b / c`. If `f >= 1`, then `l` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `f` is `1` and `y % c != 0`.***
