`f` is assigned the value `0`. The initial values of `b` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`; `f` is `0`.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`; `f` is `0`**.
