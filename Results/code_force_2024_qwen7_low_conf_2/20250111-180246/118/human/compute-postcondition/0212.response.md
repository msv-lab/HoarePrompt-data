`l` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `l` is undefined, so after the operation, `l` is `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is undefined, `m` is undefined, `o` is `[s - l]`, `s` is `s - l`, and `l` is `-1`.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is undefined, `m` is undefined, `o` is `[s - l]`, `s` is `s - l`, and `l` is `-1`**
