To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop condition.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `k` is a positive even integer
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `l` is 1 less than its initial value
- `r` is 1 more than its initial value
- `ans` is an empty list
- If `i` is even, `l` is reset to its initial value. Otherwise, `r` is unchanged and `i` is not an even number
- `j` is undefined

The loop condition is:
```
for j in range(i, n, k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range `[i, n)` with a step size of `k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is a positive even integer.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

2. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is 1 and `k` is a positive even integer, the first value of `j` would be `1 + k`.
   - For the loop to continue, `1 + k` must be less than `n`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will increment by `k` (a positive even integer) for each iteration.
   - `j` starts from `1 + k` and increments by `k` until it reaches or exceeds `n`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.

4. **Final States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by `k`, making `i = 1 + k`.
   - `j` will start from `1 + k` and will be less than `n` for the next iteration.
   - `l` remains 1 less than its initial value.
   - `r` remains 1 more than its initial value.
   - `ans` remains an empty list.
   - `k` remains a positive even integer.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `j` will be defined as the starting value of the next iteration, which is `1 + k`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1 + k, `j` is 1 + k, `k` is a positive even integer, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 1 less than its initial value, `r` is 1 more than its initial value, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is defined as 1 + k**
