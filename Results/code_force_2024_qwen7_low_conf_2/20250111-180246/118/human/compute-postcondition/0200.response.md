`f` is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is 0, `m` is undefined, `s` is undefined, and `l` is undefined.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer that must be less than `b-1`, `f` is 0, `m` is undefined, `s` is undefined, and `l` is undefined.**
