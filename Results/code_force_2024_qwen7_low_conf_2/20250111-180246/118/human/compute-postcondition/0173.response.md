`m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` was undefined initially, it is now assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `f` is 0, `m` is 1, and `s` is undefined.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `f` is 0, `m` is 1, and `s` is undefined**
