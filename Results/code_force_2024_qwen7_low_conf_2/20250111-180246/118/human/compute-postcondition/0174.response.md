The code snippet `l = h` is provided, but there is no definition for the variable `h` in the given initial state or within the snippet itself. Since `h` is not defined, we cannot assign a value to `l`. Therefore, the value of `l` remains undefined, and the states of all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer, `c` is an integer, `f` is 0, `m` is 1, `s` is undefined, `l` is undefined**
