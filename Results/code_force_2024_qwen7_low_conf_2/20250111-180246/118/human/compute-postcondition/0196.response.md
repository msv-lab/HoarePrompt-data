Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer and not divisible by `c`, `s` is decreased by `l`, `o` is a list containing the new value of `s`, and `l` is odd. If `f` is greater than or equal to 1, then `f` remains unchanged (i.e., `f` is 0). Otherwise, `f` is incremented by 1.***
