`l` is decremented by 1. The value of `b` remains a non-negative integer, `y` remains an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`, and `s` is decreased by `l`. The state of `o` (which contains `[s]`) is also updated accordingly.

Output State: **`b` is a non-negative integer, `y` is an integer such that `y + 1` is less than `b - 1`, `s` is decreased by `l`, `o` is a list containing `[s - l]`**
