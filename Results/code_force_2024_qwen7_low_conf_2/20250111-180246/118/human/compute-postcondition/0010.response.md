Output State: **No valid initial state exists due to the contradiction in the condition `i % 2` is not equal to 0 when `i` is 0. `r` is decreased by 1.**

Note: The initial state provided is contradictory because `i % 2` cannot be not equal to 0 when `i` is 0. However, `r` is decreased by 1 as per the given code snippet.
