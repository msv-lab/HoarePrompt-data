You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        
        print(e)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer processed, `a` is the last second input integer processed, `b` is the last third input integer processed, `c` is the last `a * n`, `d` is the last `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is the minimum of `a`, `c`, and `d`, and `e` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than half of the regular price for one yogurt (`a`). In such cases, it would be cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price rather than using the promotion.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
3 10 11
```

In this case, the regular price for one yogurt is 10 burles, and the promotion price for two yogurts is 11 burles. The optimal strategy would be to buy one yogurt at 10 burles and the remaining two yogurts at 11 burles (5.5 burles each), resulting in a total cost of `10 + 2 * 5.5 = 21` burles.

However, the program calculates the cost as either `a * n` (regular price) or `b + (n - 2) * a` (promotion price), which will result in `10 * 3 = 30` burles, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if the promotion price per yogurt (`b / 2`) is less than the regular price (`a`). If so, it should use the promotion price for all but one yogurt, or adjust the number of yogurts bought at the regular price accordingly.
