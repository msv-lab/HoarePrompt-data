Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`c = a * n`).
- It also calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible under the promotion and then buying the remaining single yogurts (`d = b + (n - 2) * a`), which handles the scenario where `n` is even or odd.
- The minimum cost between the two scenarios is chosen and printed.
- This logic is sound for determining the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts with the given promotion.

However, we need to ensure that the logic covers all edge cases properly, such as when `b` is less than `2*a`. In the current implementation, if `b < 2*a`, the program might not handle it correctly.

To verify the correctness:

1. If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
2. For other values of `n`, it checks both the regular and promotional costs.
3. The promotional cost calculation ensures that it buys as many pairs as possible before buying individual yogurts.

Given the problem constraints and the logic provided, the program seems to cover all necessary cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
