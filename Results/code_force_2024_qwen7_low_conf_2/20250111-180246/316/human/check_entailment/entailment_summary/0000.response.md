Reasoning:  
The given program aims to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Let's break down the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates the cost if all yogurts were bought individually (`c = a * n`).
4. It calculates the cost if the optimal number of pairs is bought under promotion and the rest are bought individually (`d = b + (n - 2) * a` if `n` is greater than 2).
5. It determines the minimum cost between these two options and prints it.

Let's analyze the logic:
- If `n == 1`, the cost is simply `a` (one yogurt at the regular price).
- If `n > 1`, it considers both the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying as many pairs as possible under promotion, plus any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
- The formula `d = b + (n - 2) * a` ensures that Maxim buys as many pairs as possible under promotion and buys the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price.

The logic appears to correctly cover all scenarios, including the edge case when `n == 1`. However, the program lacks input validation and error handling, which could lead to issues if the input data format is not strictly adhered to.

Despite these potential issues with input handling, the core logic of the program is correct for the given problem statement and examples.

Correctness: **True**
