Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the solution step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It correctly handles the input for each test case by reading three integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`).

2. **Single Yogurt Case**: If `n` is 1, the program directly calculates the cost as `a` (the price of one yogurt). This is correct because buying just one yogurt means no benefit from the promotion.

3. **Multiple Yogurts Case**: For `n > 1`, the program calculates the total cost in two different ways:
   - **Regular Price**: `c = a * n`. This is the total cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - **Promotion Price**: `d = b + (n - 2) * a`. This is the total cost if the first two yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and the remaining `(n - 2)` yogurts are bought at the regular price.

4. **Minimum Cost Calculation**: The program then calculates the minimum cost between the two options and prints it. This ensures that Maxim buys the yogurts at the lowest possible cost.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts, which matches the requirement in the problem statement.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, ensuring that the output is the price of one yogurt (`a`). It also handles larger values of `n` by comparing the costs calculated using both the regular and promotional prices.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, the program is correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
