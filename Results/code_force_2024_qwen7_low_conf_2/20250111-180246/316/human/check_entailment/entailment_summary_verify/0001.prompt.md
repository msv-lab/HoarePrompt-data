You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n == 1:
            e = a
        else:
            c = a * n
            d = b + (n - 2) * a
            e = min(c, d)
        print(e)



- Function Summary: 
- The function assumes that `t` is always positive and within the given range (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). If `t` is outside this range, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function does not handle invalid input types (e.g., non-integer inputs) or invalid ranges for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- There is no error handling for cases where `n` might be 0, although this scenario is technically covered by the condition `n == 1` which assigns `a` directly to `e`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`c = a * n`).
- It also calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible under the promotion and then buying the remaining single yogurts (`d = b + (n - 2) * a`), which handles the scenario where `n` is even or odd.
- The minimum cost between the two scenarios is chosen and printed.
- This logic is sound for determining the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts with the given promotion.

However, we need to ensure that the logic covers all edge cases properly, such as when `b` is less than `2*a`. In the current implementation, if `b < 2*a`, the program might not handle it correctly.

To verify the correctness:

1. If `n` is 1, the cost is simply `a`.
2. For other values of `n`, it checks both the regular and promotional costs.
3. The promotional cost calculation ensures that it buys as many pairs as possible before buying individual yogurts.

Given the problem constraints and the logic provided, the program seems to cover all necessary cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
