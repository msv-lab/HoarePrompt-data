Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`c = a * n`).
   - It calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible under the promotion and then buying the remaining single yogurts (`d = b + (n - 2) * a`).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Case `n == 1`**: The cost is directly set to `a`, which is correct.
   - **General Case `n > 1`**: The cost is calculated by considering both the regular price and the promotional price, ensuring the minimum cost is chosen.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function assumes valid inputs within the specified range.
   - There is no explicit error handling for invalid input types or out-of-range values, but the logic still appears to work within the given constraints.

5. **Promotional Price Consideration**:
   - The promotional price `b` is considered for pairs of yogurts.
   - The logic handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly by calculating the cost of buying pairs and the remaining single yogurts.

6. **Validation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified the logic as sound for determining the minimum cost.
   - However, we need to ensure that the logic handles the scenario where `b` is less than `2*a` correctly.
   - In such cases, buying in pairs would always be cheaper than buying individually, so the logic should always choose the promotional price for at least some pairs.

Given the problem constraints and the logic provided, the program seems to cover all necessary cases correctly, including the edge case where `b < 2*a`.

Final: **True**
