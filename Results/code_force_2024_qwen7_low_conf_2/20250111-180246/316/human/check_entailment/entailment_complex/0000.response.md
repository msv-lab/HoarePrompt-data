Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying \( n \) yogurts under the given conditions.
2. The program iterates through each test case as expected.
3. It handles the special case where \( n = 1 \) by directly setting the cost to \( a \).
4. For \( n > 1 \), it calculates the cost without the promotion and with the promotion, and then selects the minimum of these two values.
5. The logic to calculate the cost when using the promotion is correct:
   - The cost without promotion is \( a \times n \).
   - The cost with promotion involves buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then possibly buying a single additional yogurt. This is calculated as \( b + (n - 2) \times a \).
6. The overall structure of the program matches the problem description and the provided examples.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
