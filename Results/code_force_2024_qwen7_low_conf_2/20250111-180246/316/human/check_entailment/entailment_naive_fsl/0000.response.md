Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the promotion price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than half of the regular price for one yogurt (`a`). In such cases, it would be cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price rather than using the promotion.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
3 10 11
```

In this case, the regular price for one yogurt is 10 burles, and the promotion price for two yogurts is 11 burles. The optimal strategy would be to buy one yogurt at 10 burles and the remaining two yogurts at 11 burles (5.5 burles each), resulting in a total cost of `10 + 2 * 5.5 = 21` burles.

However, the program calculates the cost as either `a * n` (regular price) or `b + (n - 2) * a` (promotion price), which will result in `10 * 3 = 30` burles, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if the promotion price per yogurt (`b / 2`) is less than the regular price (`a`). If so, it should use the promotion price for all but one yogurt, or adjust the number of yogurts bought at the regular price accordingly.
