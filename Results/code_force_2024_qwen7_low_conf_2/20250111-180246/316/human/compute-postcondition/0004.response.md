`e` is assigned the value of `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` equals 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `e` equals `a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` equals 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `e` equals `a`**
