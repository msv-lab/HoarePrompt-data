`e` is assigned the value of the minimum between `c` and `d`. Given that `c` is `a * n` and `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` will take the smaller of these two values. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`**
