State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The for loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer greater than 0 and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
3. The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable inside the loop, but its value is not important for determining whether the loop can execute.
4. Since `t` is given as an input integer that satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, no adjustment is needed for `t` itself.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be considered is `t` being a positive integer within the specified range, which is already given.
