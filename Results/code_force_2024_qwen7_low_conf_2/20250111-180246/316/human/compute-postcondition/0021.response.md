The code assigns the value of `a` to `e`. Before this assignment, `e` was the minimum of `a`, `a * n`, and `b + (n - 2) * a`. Since `e` is reassigned to `a`, its value is now `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is `a`; `e` is printed.**
