The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. This affects the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, but not `t`, `c`, `d`, or `e`. Since `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\) and is not involved in the code, its value remains unchanged. The variables `c`, `d`, and `e` are not directly updated by this line of code, so their values remain as they were before.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer input
- `a` is the second integer input
- `b` is the third integer input
- `c` is `a * n`
- `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`
- `e` is the minimum of `a`, `a * n`, and `b + (n - 2) * a`
- `e` is printed

After executing the code:
- `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values read from the input.
- `c`, `d`, and `e` retain their initial definitions but are not recalculated unless `n`, `a`, or `b` change, which they do not here.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is the minimum of `a`, `a * n`, and `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is printed.**
