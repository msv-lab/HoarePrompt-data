The code snippet updates the value of `d` to be `b + (n - 2) * a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1`, but since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `t`, we only note that `t` has been decremented.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input, `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`, `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`**
