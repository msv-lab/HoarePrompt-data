The code `print(e)` simply prints the value of `e`, which is already determined in the initial state. The value of `e` is the minimum of `a`, `c`, and `d`. Since no new operations are performed on these variables by the print statement, the values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all variables.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is the minimum of `a`, `c`, and `d`, and `e` is printed.**
