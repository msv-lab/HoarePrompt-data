The code updates the value of `d` to `b + (n - 2) * a`. The previous value of `d` was `b + (n - 2) * a`, which means it remains unchanged. The value of `e` is the minimum of `a`, `a * n`, and `b + (n - 2) * a`, but since `d` is reassigned to `b + (n - 2) * a`, the value of `e` does not change. The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is the minimum of `a`, `a * n`, and `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is printed.**
