The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints, it implies that the function might internally handle multiple test cases where `t` represents the number of test cases. Each test case involves parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).

The output is not explicitly defined in the snippet, but based on the constraints, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but handles `t` test cases, where for each test case, it processes integers `n`, `a`, and `b` and returns a result for each test case.**
