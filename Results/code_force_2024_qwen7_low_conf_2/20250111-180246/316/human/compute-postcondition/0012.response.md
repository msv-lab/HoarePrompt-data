The code snippet takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. This changes the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The previous values of `t`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are still valid, but their expressions in terms of `a`, `b`, and `n` change.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is `a * n`
- `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`
- `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`
- `t` is now `t - 1`

After running the code:
- `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input.
- `a` is assigned the value of the second integer input.
- `b` is assigned the value of the third integer input.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is now `t - 1`
- `n` is the first integer input
- `a` is the second integer input
- `b` is the third integer input
- `c` is `a * n`
- `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`
- `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`**
