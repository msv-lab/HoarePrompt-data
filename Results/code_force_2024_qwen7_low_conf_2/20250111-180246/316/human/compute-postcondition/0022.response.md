The code snippet updates the value of `c` to `a * n`. This calculation is already defined in the initial state as `c = a * n`. Therefore, the value of `c` does not change from its initial state. The other variables remain unchanged as well.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\); `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is the minimum of `a`, `a * n`, and `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is printed.**
