`n, a, b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, while `t` remains unchanged as the input operation does not affect its value. The output state includes the updated values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and retains the initial value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
