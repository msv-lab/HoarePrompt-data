Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates either `a` itself (if `n == 1`) or the minimum value between `a * n` and `b + (n - 2) * a`. The function prints the calculated value for each test case. The final state of the program after all test cases are processed is that the variable `t` is set to 0, and for the last test case, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` contain the values of the last inputs processed, while `e` contains the calculated minimum value and is printed for that test case. There are no explicit return values, but the output is the series of printed values for each test case.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `t` is always positive and within the given range (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). If `t` is outside this range, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function does not handle invalid input types (e.g., non-integer inputs) or invalid ranges for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- There is no error handling for cases where `n` might be 0, although this scenario is technically covered by the condition `n == 1` which assigns `a` directly to `e`.

**Summary of Actions:**
- The function iterates over `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- It calculates the value of `e` based on the conditions provided.
- It prints the value of `e` for each test case.
