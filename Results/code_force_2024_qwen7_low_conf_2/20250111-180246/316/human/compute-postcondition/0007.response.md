`d` is assigned the value `b + (n - 2) * a`. The value of `n` is not equal to 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, and `c` is equal to `a * n`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `d` and retains the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is `a * n`, `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`**
