`c` is assigned the value of `a * n`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is not equal to 1 is still valid.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 1; `c` is `a * n`**
