The code updates the value of `c` to `a * n`. According to the initial state, `c` was previously `a * n`, and now it remains `a * n` since no other changes were made to `c` in this step.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is now `t - 1`; `n` is the first integer input; `a` is the second integer input; `b` is the third integer input; `c` is `a * n`; `d` is `b + (n - 2) * a`; `e` is `min(a * n, b + (n - 2) * a)`**
