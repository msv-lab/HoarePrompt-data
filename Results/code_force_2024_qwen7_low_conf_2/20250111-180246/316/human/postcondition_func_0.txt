- The function assumes that `t` is always positive and within the given range (`1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`). If `t` is outside this range, the function may behave unpredictably.
- The function does not handle invalid input types (e.g., non-integer inputs) or invalid ranges for `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- There is no error handling for cases where `n` might be 0, although this scenario is technically covered by the condition `n == 1` which assigns `a` directly to `e`.
