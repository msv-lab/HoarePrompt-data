You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and each test case consists of three integers a, b, c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer value with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `_` is the number of iterations completed (ranging from 1 to `t`), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user in each iteration. If any of the conditions `a < b < c`, `a < b and b > c` are met at least once during the loop, the respective text ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') will be printed to the console. Otherwise, no text will be printed, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of values entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range values for `a`, `b`, and `c`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may raise an exception.
- The function assumes that valid test cases will always be provided. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 1000, the function still processes the input but may raise an exception due to invalid input handling.
- The function does not store or return any intermediate results. All results are printed directly to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program defines a function `func()` that processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input.
3. It checks if the numbers satisfy the conditions for a "stair" (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR".
4. It checks if the numbers satisfy the conditions for a "peak" (`a < b > c`) and prints "PEAK".
5. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

Let's verify the logic for each condition:
- A "stair" is correctly identified when `a < b < c`. This part of the code works correctly.
- A "peak" is correctly identified when `a < b > c`. However, the current implementation has a small issue: the condition `a < b and b > c` will only match if `b` is strictly greater than `c`. This means that if `b` equals `c`, the program will not identify it as a "peak". The correct condition should be `a < b and b >= c`.

Given this, the program needs a slight modification to ensure the correct identification of peaks.

Correctness: **False**

The given program is almost correct but fails to identify cases where `b == c` as a "peak". To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to `a < b >= c`.
