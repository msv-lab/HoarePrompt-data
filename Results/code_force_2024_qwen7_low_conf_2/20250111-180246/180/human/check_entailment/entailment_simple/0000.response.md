Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. Let's break down how it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Number of Test Cases**: The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. It then processes each test case, which aligns with the requirement that there will be `t` lines of input, each containing three digits.

2. **Input Handling**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This ensures that the input is correctly parsed into integer values, as required.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if the digits satisfy the condition for a stair (`a < b < c`) and prints "STAIR" if true.
   - It then checks if the digits satisfy the condition for a peak (`a < b and b > c`) and prints "PEAK" if true.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case as specified in the problem description.

Since the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and outputs the results in the required format for all possible inputs within the given constraints, it meets the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
