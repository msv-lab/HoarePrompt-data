- The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range values for `a`, `b`, and `c`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may raise an exception.
- The function assumes that valid test cases will always be provided. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 1000, the function still processes the input but may raise an exception due to invalid input handling.
- The function does not store or return any intermediate results. All results are printed directly to the console.
