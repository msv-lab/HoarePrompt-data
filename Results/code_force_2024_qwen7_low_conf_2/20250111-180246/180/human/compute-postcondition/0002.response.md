The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initialized with an integer value entered by the user, and the variable `_` is reassigned to 1.

Since the specific values of the inputs are not given, we represent the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers entered by the user. The value of `t` and `_` remain as they were before the code execution.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user and 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is an integer entered by the user**
