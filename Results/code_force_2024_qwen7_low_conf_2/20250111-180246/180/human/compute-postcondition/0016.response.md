The code `print('NONE')` simply prints the string 'NONE' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\); `_` is 1; `a` is an integer entered by the user; `b` is an integer entered by the user; `c` is an integer entered by the user**
