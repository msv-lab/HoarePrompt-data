`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The initial value of `t` was an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. After executing the code, `t` will now hold the integer value entered by the user. The other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value entered by the user, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000**
