Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, it determines whether the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c` matches one of the following patterns:
- `a < b < c`: In which case, it prints 'STAIR'.
- `a < b and b > c`: In which case, it prints 'PEAK'.
- Neither of the above conditions are met: In which case, it prints 'NONE'.

After processing all test cases, the function prints the appropriate output for each case. If none of the specified conditions are met for any test case, 'NONE' is printed for that case. The function does not return any value; instead, it relies on printing the results directly to the console.**

**Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values or out-of-range values for `a`, `b`, and `c`). If invalid inputs are provided, the function may raise an exception.
- The function assumes that valid test cases will always be provided. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than 1000, the function still processes the input but may raise an exception due to invalid input handling.
- The function does not store or return any intermediate results. All results are printed directly to the console.**
