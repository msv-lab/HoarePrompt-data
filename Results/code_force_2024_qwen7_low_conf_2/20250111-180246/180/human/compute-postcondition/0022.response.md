The code prints the string 'PEAK', but it does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. The variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\); `_` is 2; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user; printed text is 'PEAK'**
