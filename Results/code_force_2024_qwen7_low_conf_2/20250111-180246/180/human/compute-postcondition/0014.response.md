The code `print('STAIR')` prints the string 'STAIR' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the only change is that the string 'STAIR' is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\); `_` is 1; `a` is an integer entered by the user; `b` is an integer entered by the user; `c` is an integer entered by the user; the string 'STAIR' is printed to the console.**
