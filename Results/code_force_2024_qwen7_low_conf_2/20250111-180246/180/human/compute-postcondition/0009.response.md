The code `print('NONE')` simply prints the string 'NONE' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value entered by the user and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `c` is an integer entered by the user, and it is not the case that `a < b < c` and it is also not the case that `a < b > c`. The console prints 'NONE'.**
