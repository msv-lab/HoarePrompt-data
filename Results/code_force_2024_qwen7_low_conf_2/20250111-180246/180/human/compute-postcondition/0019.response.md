Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` (the loop counter) is 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `_` (the loop counter) is less than `t`.

3. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, if `a < b < c`, the string 'STAIR' is printed to the console. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, or `c`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**: Since `_` is 1, this means we have just completed the first iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be less than `t`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, we need to increment `_` by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 2.

6. **State Adjustment**: The value of `t` remains unchanged, but `_` is now 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same unless they were changed within the loop body, but since no changes were made in the example given, they stay as originally entered.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\); `_` is 2; `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**
