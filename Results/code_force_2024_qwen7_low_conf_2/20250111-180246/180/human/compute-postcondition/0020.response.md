The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. This directly affects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\); `_` is 2; `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.**
