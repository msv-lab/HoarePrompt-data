The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\)
- `_` is 1
- `a` is an integer entered by the user
- `b` is an integer entered by the user
- `c` is an integer entered by the user

After executing the code, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the integers entered by the user, while `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer value with \(1 < t \leq 1000\); `_` is 1; `a` is an integer entered by the user; `b` is an integer entered by the user; `c` is an integer entered by the user**
