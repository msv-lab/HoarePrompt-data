The function `func` accepts no parameters directly. Instead, it implies that the input parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are passed through some external mechanism (e.g., a caller function or a list/tuple). However, based on the given constraints and relationships, we can infer the following:

- `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.
- Each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9`.

The function itself does not explicitly take any parameters but processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes `a`, `b`, and `c`. The output depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.

Given the output structure, it suggests that the function might return a list or a series of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts `t` test cases, where each test case consists of integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, and returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
