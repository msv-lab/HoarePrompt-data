Output State: **`t` is an integer value with 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `_` is the number of iterations completed (ranging from 1 to `t`), `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user in each iteration. If any of the conditions `a < b < c`, `a < b and b > c` are met at least once during the loop, the respective text ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') will be printed to the console. Otherwise, no text will be printed, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of values entered by the user.**
