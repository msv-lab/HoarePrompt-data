Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final value of `n` provided by `int(input())` in the last iteration, `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1' across all iterations, `s1` is the total count of '1's in the string `s` across all iterations, `f1` is the total count of '1's in the string `f` across all iterations, and the output of the print statement is `max(s1, f1) - c`.**
