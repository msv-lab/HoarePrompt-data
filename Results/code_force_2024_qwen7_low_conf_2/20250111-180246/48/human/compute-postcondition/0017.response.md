Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `t`: A positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`: A non-negative integer.
   - `c`: The number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1'.
   - `s1`: Initially 0.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `s`.
   - Each iteration involves processing an element from `s`.

4. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty list. This is because the loop iterates over elements of `s`.

5. **Initial State Adjustment:**
   - Given the current state, `s1` is 0.
   - The loop does not directly depend on `t`, `n`, or `c` for its execution; however, these values might be updated inside the loop body.
   - Since the loop iterates over `s`, `s` must be a non-empty list.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, `s` must be a non-empty list. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', `s1` is 0, `s` is a non-empty list**.
