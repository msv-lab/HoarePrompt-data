`f1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `f1` is 2, `f` is a non-empty iterable, and the current value of `i` is the next element in `f`.

Output State: **`s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `f1` is 2, `f` is a non-empty iterable, and the current value of `i` is the next element in `f`.**
