`s1` is incremented by 1, meaning its new value is the previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \( 0 \leq i < n \)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', `s1` is the previous value of `s1` plus 1, `s` is a non-empty list (and it must still contain elements for the next iteration)**
