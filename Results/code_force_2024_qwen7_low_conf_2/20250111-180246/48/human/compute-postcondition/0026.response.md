Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', and `s1` is incremented by 1 if the current value of `i` is '1'. Otherwise, `s1` remains unchanged, and `s` is a non-empty list with at least one element remaining.***
