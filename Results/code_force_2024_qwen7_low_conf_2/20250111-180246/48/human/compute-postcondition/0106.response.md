Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `s1` is 2.
   - `i` equals the second element in `s`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the sequence `s`.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that after each iteration, `i` takes the next element from the sequence `s`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be the third element in `s`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - `s1` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` should now be set to the third element in `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:
State: **`s1` is 2, `i` equals the third element in `s`**
