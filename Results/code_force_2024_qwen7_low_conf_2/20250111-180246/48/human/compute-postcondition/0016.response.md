The code initializes `s1` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `c`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `s1`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', and `s1` is 0.**
