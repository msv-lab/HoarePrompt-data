`f1` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `f1` is 3, `f` must have at least one more element, and the current value of `i` is the next element in `f`.

Output State: **`s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `f1` is 3, `f` must have at least one more element, and the current value of `i` is the next element in `f`.**
