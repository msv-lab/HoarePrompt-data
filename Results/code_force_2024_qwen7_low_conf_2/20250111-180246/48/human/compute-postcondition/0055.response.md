Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 0, `c` is incremented by 1 if `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'`, otherwise `c` remains unchanged, `s1` and `f1` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, `s` and `f` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 2`***
