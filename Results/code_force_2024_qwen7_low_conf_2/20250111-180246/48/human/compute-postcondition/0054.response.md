`c` is incremented by 1. Given that `c` was previously the previous value of `c` + 1 if `s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1'`, or remained unchanged otherwise, the new value of `c` will be the previous value of `c` + 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 0, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 1, `s1` and `f1` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, `s` and `f` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 2`**
