Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `s1` is 2 or 3, `s` is a string that must not be empty. The program sets `s1` to 2 or 3 inside the if block and does nothing in the else block.***
