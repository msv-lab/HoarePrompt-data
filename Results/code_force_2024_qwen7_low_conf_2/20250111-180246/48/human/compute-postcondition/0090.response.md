Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input()) - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is 1, `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `s` is the input string from the user, `f1` is equal to the number of '1's in the string `f`, `f` is the input string from the user. If `s[i]` is '1' and `f[i]` is '1', then `c` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `c` remains unchanged.***
