`s1` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s1` is 0, so after the operation, `s1` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', `s1` is 1, `s` is a non-empty list, the current value of `i` is '1'**
