Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `s1` is 1 or 2, `s` is `s[1:]`. If `i == '1'`, the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.***
