`s1` is initially 1, and it is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the second element in `s`, but since `s` itself is not modified, its state remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` is 2, `i` equals the second element in `s`.

Output State: **`s1` is 2, `i` equals the second element in `s`**
