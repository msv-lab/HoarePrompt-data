`s1` is initially 2, and `i` is the third element in `s`. The code `s1 += 1` increments `s1` by 1. Since `s1` was initially 2, after the increment, `s1` becomes 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s1` is 3, `i` equals the third element in `s`**
