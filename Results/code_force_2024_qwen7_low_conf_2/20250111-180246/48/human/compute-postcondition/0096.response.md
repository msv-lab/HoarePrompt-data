Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input()) - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `c` is `c + 2`, `s1` is the count of '1's in the string `s`, `s` is the input string from the user, `f1` is equal to the number of '1's in the string `f`, `f` is the input string from the user, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `s[i] == f[i]` and `s[i] == '1'`, then `c` is incremented by 1.***
