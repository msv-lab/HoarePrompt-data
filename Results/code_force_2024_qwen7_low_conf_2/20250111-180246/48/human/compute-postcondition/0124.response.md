The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function should process input from standard input or another source. The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of:
- A positive integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- A string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1',
- A string `f` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'.

Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

The function returns a result for each test case, which could be a count of the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `f`, or some other specific value based on the problem requirements.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n`, a binary string `s` of length `n`, and a binary string `f` of length `n`. For each test case, the function returns a result based on transforming the string `s` to match the string `f`.**
