The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, and `c` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, and `c` is 3**
