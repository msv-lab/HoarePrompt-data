According to the given code and the state at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition depends on the variable `i` and `n`. Specifically, if `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `c` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.

The new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change in `i` while keeping the other variables as they are, since there was no mention of changing `t` or `n` based on the loop body's behavior in the given conditions.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, and `c` is 1.**
