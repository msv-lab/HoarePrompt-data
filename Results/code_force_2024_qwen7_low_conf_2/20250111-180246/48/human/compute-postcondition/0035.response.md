Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', `s1` is the total count of '1's in the list `s`, `s` is an empty list if the loop did not execute at all, otherwise it is the same list passed to the loop, `f` is a list with at least one element, and the first element of `f` is `i` with `f1` being 2 if `i` is '1' and 1 if `i` is not '1'. If `i` is '1', `c` is incremented by 1 and `f1` is set to 2. Otherwise, `f1` remains unchanged.***
