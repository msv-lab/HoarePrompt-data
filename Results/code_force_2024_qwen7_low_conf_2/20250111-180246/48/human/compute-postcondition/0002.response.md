`s` is assigned the value of the input string. The input string replaces the previous value of `s`, which was a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `f` is a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `f` is a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'**
