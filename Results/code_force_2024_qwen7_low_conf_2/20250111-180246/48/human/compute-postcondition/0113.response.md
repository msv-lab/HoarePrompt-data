`f1` is incremented by 1. The value of `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `f1` is initially 0, and it gets incremented by 1. The value of `f` is a non-empty iterable, and the current value of `i` is '1'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `f1` is 1, `f` is a non-empty iterable, the current value of `i` is '1'**
