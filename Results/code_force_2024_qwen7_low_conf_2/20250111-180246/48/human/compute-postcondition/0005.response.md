According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer, and since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we know that `t` is valid, but it doesn't ensure that `n` is within the same range or even positive.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `n` is a positive integer. The initial state only mentions `t`, so we need to explicitly state that `n` must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be a positive integer**
