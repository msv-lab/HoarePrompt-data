`s1` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `s1`, we only know that `s1` was previously a non-negative integer. After executing `s1 += 1`, `s1` will be one more than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', `s1` is one more than its previous value, and `s` is a non-empty list with at least one element remaining**.
