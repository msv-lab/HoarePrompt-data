State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1', and a string `f` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1', and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, `_` is set to the value read from input**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs for each test case specified by `t`.
2. For each test case, the loop reads three inputs: `n`, `s`, and `f`.
3. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
4. `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'.
5. `f` is a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to include these values as they are necessary for each iteration of the loop. The variable `_` (under the hood, this is usually an index or a value representing the current test case) is automatically set to the value read from input when the loop starts.

Thus, the required state includes the parameters needed for each test case and the automatic setting of `_` to the value read from input.
