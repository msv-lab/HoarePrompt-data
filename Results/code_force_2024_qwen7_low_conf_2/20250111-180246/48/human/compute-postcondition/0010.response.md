The code increments the value of `c` by 1. Initially, `c` is 1, so after executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` becomes 2. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, and `c` is 2.**
