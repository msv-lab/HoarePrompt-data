Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `c` is the number of indices `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) such that `s[i]` equals `f[i]` and both equal '1', `s1` is the total count of '1's in the list `s`, `s` is an empty list if the loop did not execute at all, otherwise it is the same list passed to the loop.**
