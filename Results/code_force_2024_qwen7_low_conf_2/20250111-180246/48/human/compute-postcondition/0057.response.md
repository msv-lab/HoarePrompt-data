`s1` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `s1` is now explicitly set to `0`, and this assignment does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `s1` is `0`, `s` and `f` are the final user inputs, and `i` is `n - 1`.**
