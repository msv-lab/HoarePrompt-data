`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` is an integer input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The other variables (`s` and `f`) are also not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1', `f` is a string of length `n` containing only '0' and '1', and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5**
