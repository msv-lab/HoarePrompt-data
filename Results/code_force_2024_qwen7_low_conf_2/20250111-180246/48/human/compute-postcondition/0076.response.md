Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1'. If `i` is '1', `f1` is set to 2. If `i` is not '1', the postcondition remains as the precondition since there is no change in the else part. `f` must have at least one less character than before.***
