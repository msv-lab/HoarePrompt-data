Postcondition: ***`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is greater than 0, `c` is 1, `s1` and `f1` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, `s` is the new user input, `f` is the new input string, and the current value of `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `f[i]`. Otherwise, `c` remains 0, `s1` and `f1` remain unchanged, and other variables retain their previous values.***
