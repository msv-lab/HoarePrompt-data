`s1` is incremented by 1. The value of `s1` was either 0 or 1 (depending on the previous state), so now it will be 1 or 2. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is the new input value provided by `int(input())`, `n` is a positive integer, `c` is the count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1', `s1` is 1 or 2, `s` is `s[1:]`**
