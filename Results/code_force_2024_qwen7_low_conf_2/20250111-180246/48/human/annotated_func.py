#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the second line is a string s of length n containing only '0' and '1', representing the initial state of the boxes, and the third line is a string f of length n containing only '0' and '1', representing the desired state of the boxes. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        f = input()
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s[i] == f[i] and s[i] == '1':
                c += 1
        
        s1 = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == '1':
                s1 += 1
        
        f1 = 0
        
        for i in f:
            if i == '1':
                f1 += 1
        
        print(max(s1, f1) - c)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final value of `n` provided by `int(input())` in the last iteration, `c` is the total count of positions where `s[i]` and `f[i]` are both '1' across all iterations, `s1` is the total count of '1's in the string `s` across all iterations, `f1` is the total count of '1's in the string `f` across all iterations, and the output of the print statement is `max(s1, f1) - c`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer \(n\), a binary string \(s\) of length \(n\), and a binary string \(f\) of length \(n\). For each test case, the function calculates the minimum number of changes required to transform the binary string \(s\) into the binary string \(f\). The transformation is based on changing any '0' to '1' in \(s\). The function then prints the maximum number of '1's in either \(s\) or \(f\) minus the count of positions where both \(s[i]\) and \(f[i]\) are '1'. This is because those positions do not require any change. However, the function does not account for the possibility that \(s\) might already have more '1's than \(f\), which could lead to an incorrect result if \(s\) initially has more '1's than \(f\). Additionally, the function does not handle the case where \(n\) exceeds the constraints (i.e., \(n > 10^5\)), though this is unlikely given the overall constraint on the sum of \(n\) over all test cases.
