t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the second line is a string s of length n containing only '0' and '1', representing the initial state of the boxes, and the third line is a string f of length n containing only '0' and '1', representing the desired state of the boxes. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
