t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. Each test case also includes k pairs of integers r_i and c_i representing the coordinates of the fountains, where 1 <= r_i <= n and 1 <= c_i <= m, and all fountain positions are distinct and none of them is (n, 1).
