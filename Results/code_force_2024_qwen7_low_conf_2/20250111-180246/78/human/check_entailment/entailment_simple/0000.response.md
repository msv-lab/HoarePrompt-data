Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given annotated program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Output Format**: The problem description requires the program to output the maximum possible size of Alice's plot (\(\alpha\)) followed by \(k\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k\). These integers should be 0 or 1 based on whether giving the \(i\)-th fountain to Alice increases the size of her plot. However, the provided program outputs the size of the plot correctly but the list of \(a_i\) values is always set to all 1s, regardless of the actual logic required by the problem.

2. **Logic for \(a_i\) Values**: According to the problem description, \(a_i\) should be 0 if the maximum possible size of Alice's plot does not increase when the \(i\)-th fountain is given to her, and 1 if it does increase. The current program sets all \(a_i\) values to 1, which does not reflect the logic required by the problem.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly determine whether the size of Alice's plot increases when each fountain is given to her. This involves checking how the presence of each fountain affects the optimal path Alice can take. Specifically, the program should update the list of \(a_i\) values based on whether giving each fountain to Alice results in a larger plot.

### Example Fix:
Hereâ€™s a simplified example of how you might modify the code to correctly compute the \(a_i\) values:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        c = []
        for i in range(k):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            c.append((y, x, i))
        c.sort()
        
        f = [(1, 0, 0)]
        s = 0
        answer = [0] * k
        
        for i in range(k):
            if c[i][1] > f[-1][1]:
                s += (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])
                f.append((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]))
        
        # Determine if adding each fountain increases the plot size
        max_size = s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m
        new_f = f[:]
        for i in range(k):
            new_f.remove(c[i])
            if s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m < s + (n - new_f[-1][1]) * m:
                answer[c[i][2]] = 1
            new_f.append(c[i])
        
        print(max_size)
        print(*answer)

func()
```

In this corrected version, the program dynamically checks if removing each fountain and recalculating the plot size results in a larger plot. If it does, the corresponding \(a_i\) value is set to 1. This ensures that the program correctly follows the problem description.
