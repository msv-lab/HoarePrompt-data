Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the optimal path for Alice to maximize the number of cells she owns. If Bob gives Alice a fountain, we need to check if this increases the size of Alice's plot.
2. **Key Points**:
   - Alice must start at a cell on the left or top side and move right or down.
   - Alice's path will end on the right or bottom side.
   - Alice owns the part including the cell (n, 1).
   - Bob owns the part including the cell (1, m).
   - Bob can give one fountain to Alice, and we need to determine if giving each fountain increases the size of Alice's plot.
3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` (dimensions and number of fountains).
   - It then reads the coordinates of the fountains and stores them in a list `c`.
   - The fountains are sorted by their y-coordinate.
   - A list `f` is initialized with a dummy entry `(1, 0, 0)` to simplify calculations.
   - The variable `s` accumulates the area of Alice's plot without considering the fountains.
   - The fountains are processed in order, updating `s` and `f` accordingly.
   - For each fountain, the code checks if giving the fountain to Alice increases the size of her plot.
   - The result `s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m` is calculated, which represents the size of Alice's plot if no fountains are given.
   - The answers for each fountain are stored in `answer` and printed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for sorting and processing the fountains seems correct.
   - The calculation of `s` (the area of Alice's plot) is accurate.
   - The logic for checking if giving each fountain to Alice increases the size of her plot appears to be implemented correctly.
   - The output format matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **True**
