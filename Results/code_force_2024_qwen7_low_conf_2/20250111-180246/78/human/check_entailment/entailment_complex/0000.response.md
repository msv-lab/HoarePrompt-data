Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`. It also correctly reads the coordinates of the `k` fountains.

2. **Sorting Fountains**: The fountains are sorted based on their row coordinates, which is necessary to ensure the construction of the boundary points works correctly.

3. **Constructing Boundary Points**: The function constructs a list of boundary points `f` starting with `(1, 0, 0)` and iteratively adds new points that have a higher row coordinate than the previous point. This ensures that the boundary points represent the minimum bounding rectangle for the fountains.

4. **Calculating Area**: The area of the smallest rectangle covering all the fountains is calculated correctly by summing up the vertical distances between consecutive boundary points and the horizontal distance from the first point to the last point.

5. **Determining Boundary Fountains**: The function correctly determines which fountains lie on the boundary by checking if their row coordinate is strictly greater than the previous boundary pointâ€™s row coordinate. This logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

6. **Output**: The function prints the total area and the sequence of 1s and 0s indicating whether each fountain is on the boundary or not. The output format matches the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the function's logic, the function appears to handle all cases correctly. The function does not introduce any logical errors or fail to account for edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
