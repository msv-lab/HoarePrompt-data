Let's break down the given scenario step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer input from the user where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `m` remain unspecified.
- `k` remains unspecified.
- The coordinates of `k` fountains are pairs of integers \((r_i, c_i)\) where \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\) and \(1 \leq c_i \leq m\), and all coordinates are distinct and none of them is \((n, 1)\).

### Loop Statement:
```
for z in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop will execute for each value of `z` in the range `range(t)`.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since the range function in Python includes the start value but excludes the stop value, `range(t)` will include values from 0 to \(t-1\)). Therefore, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- There are no constraints on `n`, `m`, or `k` provided in the context that would affect the loop's execution. However, we should note that these values are unspecified.
- The coordinates of the fountains are specified to be pairs of integers within certain ranges, and they must be distinct and not equal to \((n, 1)\). These conditions are already stated in the problem and do not need adjustment.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is at least 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
