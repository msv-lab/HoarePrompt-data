The code appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is at least 1,
- `n` is an input integer,
- `m` is an input integer,
- `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2,
- `c` is a list containing two tuples `[(y, x, 0), (y, x, i)]`,
- `x` is an integer from the split input,
- `y` is an integer from the split input,
- `i` is equal to `k`.

The new tuple `(y, x, i)` will be added to the list `c`. The previous contents of `c` were `[(y, x, 0), (y, x, i)]`, and now it will become `[(y, x, 0), (y, x, i), (y, x, i)]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `c` is a list containing three tuples `[(y, x, 0), (y, x, i), (y, x, i)]`, `x` is an integer from the split input, `y` is an integer from the split input, `i` is equal to `k`**
