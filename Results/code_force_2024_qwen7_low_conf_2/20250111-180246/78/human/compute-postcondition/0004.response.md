According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Given the initial states:

- `t` must be at least 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `c` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `k` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `c` is an empty list**
