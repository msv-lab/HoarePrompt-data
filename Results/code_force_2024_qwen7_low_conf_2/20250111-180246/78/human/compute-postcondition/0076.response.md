Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `f` is a list of `k` elements where each element is `(c[j][0], c[j][1], c[j][2])` for `j` in range `k`, `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `s` is the sum of `(c[j][0] - 1) * (c[j][1] - f[-1][1])` for `j` such that `c[j][1] > f[-1][1]`, and `answer` is a list of `k` zeros.**
