`c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple containing the values of `y`, `x`, and `i` to the list `c`. Since `i` is initially 0, the tuple added to `c` will be `(y, x, 0)`. The values of `z`, `t`, `f`, `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is 0; `z` must be less than `t`; `f` is a list of `k` elements; `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` are as given; `c` contains a new element `(y, x, 0)`**
