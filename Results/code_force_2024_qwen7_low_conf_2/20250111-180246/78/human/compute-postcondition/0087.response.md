Postcondition: ***`i` is `k + 1`, `f` is a list of `k` elements, and `i` must be within the range `[1, k-1]`. If `f[i][0]` is less than `f[i + 1][0]`, then `answer[f[i][2]]` is 1. Since there is no else part, the condition `answer[f[i][2]]` remains unchanged if `f[i][0]` is not less than `f[i + 1][0]`.***
