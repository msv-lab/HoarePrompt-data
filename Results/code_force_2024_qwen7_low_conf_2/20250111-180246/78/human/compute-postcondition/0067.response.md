Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range [0, k-1], `f` is a list of two elements where the second element is (c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2]), `c` is a list of length k containing the tuples (y, x, i) for each iteration of the loop, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `s` is 0 + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1]), and `answer` is a list of k zeros.***
