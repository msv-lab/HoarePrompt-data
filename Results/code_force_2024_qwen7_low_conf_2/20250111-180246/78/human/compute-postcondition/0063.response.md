Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given States:
- `i` is `k`
- `f` is `[(1, 0, 0)]`
- `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop
- `x` is the last input integer
- `y` is the last input integer
- `s` is 0
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros

### Loop:
```
for i in range(k):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `k-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range `[0, k-1]`.

2. **Variable `f`:**
   - The initial value of `f` is `[(1, 0, 0)]`.
   - This list does not depend on `i` directly but may change during the loop execution.

3. **Variable `c`:**
   - `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)`.
   - Since the list `c` is defined based on `k`, its length is already set to `k`.

4. **Variables `x` and `y`:**
   - These are inputs to the loop and their values are not directly related to the loop condition.

5. **Variable `s`:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0 and does not affect the loop condition.

6. **Variable `answer`:**
   - `answer` is a list of `k` zeros and does not affect the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to start executing, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Specifically, `i` should be in the range `[0, k-1]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is in the range `[0, k-1]`, `f` is `[(1, 0, 0)]`, `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `s` is 0, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros**
