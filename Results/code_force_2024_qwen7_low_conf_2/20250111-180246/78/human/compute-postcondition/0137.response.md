The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it mentions that each test case consists of integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints, along with the coordinates of `k` fountains. The coordinates of the fountains are pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` within certain ranges. 

Based on the given information, the function does not directly return anything from its body since no return statement is mentioned in the provided code snippet. Instead, it seems to process the test case data internally.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes test case data consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints, along with the coordinates of `k` fountains as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` within certain ranges.**
