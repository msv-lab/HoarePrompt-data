The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial values of `i` and `f` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 0, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including \((1, 0, 0)\) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer**.
