Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(f) - 2`, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list of at least 3 elements including `(1, 0, 0)`, `answer` is a list of `k` ones with one element updated to `1` at index `f[i][2]` if `f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]` is true, `n`, `m`, and `k` are as given, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple, and `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where the condition is true.***
