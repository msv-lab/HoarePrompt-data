`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` will hold the integer input from the user, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the precondition that remains valid after the code execution is that each test case consists of `n`, `m`, and `k` where `2 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 2 * 10^5`, and the coordinates of `k` fountains are given as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` such that `1 <= r_i <= n` and `1 <= c_i <= m`, and all coordinates are distinct and none of them is `(n, 1)`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer input from the user where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `n` and `m` remain unspecified, `k` remains unspecified, and the coordinates of `k` fountains remain as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` where `1 <= r_i <= n` and `1 <= c_i <= m`, and all coordinates are distinct and none of them is `(n, 1)`.**
