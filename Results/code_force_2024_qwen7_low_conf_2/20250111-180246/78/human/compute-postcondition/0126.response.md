Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range `[1, len(f) - 2]`, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list of at least 3 elements, `f` contains the element `(1, 0, 0)` and any tuples `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`, `answer` is a list of `k` ones with one element set to `0` at the index specified by `f[i][2]` if the condition `(f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0])` is satisfied, `n` is as given, `m` is as given, `k` is as given, `c` is a list of `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1`, and `c` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple, `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where the condition is true. If the condition `(f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0])` is not satisfied, `answer` remains unchanged, and `s` is still the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where the condition is true.***
