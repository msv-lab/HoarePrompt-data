The given code snippet does not affect any of the variables directly. Instead, it prints the value of `s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m`. Since this operation does not modify any variables, only prints a value, the output of the code is the result of this calculation.

To express the output state:

Output State: **`s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including `(1, 0, 0)` and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, the value printed is `s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m`.**
