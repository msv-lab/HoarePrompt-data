The code snippet appends a tuple `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])` to the list `f`. Given that `i` is 5, the tuple added is `(c[5][0], c[5][1], c[5][2])`. This new tuple is added to the existing list `f`, which originally contained the tuples `(1, 0, 0)`, `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`, and `(c[3][0], c[3][1], c[3][2])`. After appending, the list `f` now contains four tuples.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `t` is at least 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is greater than 0
- `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`
- `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)`, `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`, `(c[3][0], c[3][1], c[3][2])`, and `(c[5][0], c[5][1], c[5][2])`
- `s` is `s + (c[5][0] - 1) * (c[5][1] - c[3][1])`
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros
- `i` is 5

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)`, `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`, `(c[3][0], c[3][1], c[3][2])`, and `(c[5][0], c[5][1], c[5][2])`, `s` is `s + (c[5][0] - 1) * (c[5][1] - c[3][1])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `i` is 5**
