The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The previous value of `i` is 0, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including \((1, 0, 0)\) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer.

After appending the tuple `(y, x, i)` to `c`, the value of `i` remains unchanged (0), and the list `c` now includes the new tuple. The other variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including \((1, 0, 0)\) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and `c` is a list with an additional tuple `(y, x, 0)` appended to it.**
