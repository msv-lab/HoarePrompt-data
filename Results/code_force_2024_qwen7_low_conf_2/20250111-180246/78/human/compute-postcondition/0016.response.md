`s` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remains unchanged, and the lists `c` and `f` are also unaffected.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is 0**
