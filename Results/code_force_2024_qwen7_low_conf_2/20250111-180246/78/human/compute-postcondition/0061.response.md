`s` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `s` but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `k`; `f` is `[(1, 0, 0)]`; `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop; `x` is the last input integer; `y` is the last input integer; `s` is 0.
