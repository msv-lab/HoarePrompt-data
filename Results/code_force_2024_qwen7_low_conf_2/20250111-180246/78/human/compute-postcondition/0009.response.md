`c` is a list containing one tuple `(y, x, 0)`. The code appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a new variable that holds an unspecified value.

After appending the new tuple, the list `c` will contain two tuples: the original tuple `(y, x, 0)` and the new tuple `(y, x, i)`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `c` is a list containing two tuples \[(y, x, 0), (y, x, i)\], `x` is an input integer from the split input, `y` is an input integer from the split input**
