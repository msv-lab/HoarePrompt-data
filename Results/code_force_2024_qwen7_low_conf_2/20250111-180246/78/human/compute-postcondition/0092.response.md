The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the values of these variables are not specified in the initial state, so they remain unknown. The initial values of `i`, `f`, `answer`, `z`, and `t` are not directly affected by this input statement.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `f` is a list of `k` elements, for every `j` in the range `[1, len(f) - 1]`, `answer[f[j][2]]` is 1 if `f[j][0]` is less than `f[j + 1][0]`, and the value of `answer` is printed; `z` is `z + 1`, and `z` must be less than `t`; `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers.**
