Output State: **`i` is `k`, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including \((1, 0, 0)\) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples \((y, x, i)\) for each iteration of the loop, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer.**
