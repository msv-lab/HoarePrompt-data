According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
- `t` must be at least 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and `k` must be at least 1
- `c` is a list containing one tuple `(y, x, 0)`
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `k`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `k` and `k` must remain at least 1.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `c` is a list containing one tuple `(y, x, 0)`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
