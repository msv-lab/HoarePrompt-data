The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. The previous values of the variables are:
- `i` is 2
- `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples (including (1, 0, 0) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[0][1] > f[-1][1]` was true)
- `c` is a list with length `len(c) + 1` containing the original elements plus the new tuple (y, x, 1)
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer

After appending the new tuple `(y, x, i)` to `c`, the updated list `c` will contain its original elements plus the new tuple `(y, x, 2)`.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples (including (1, 0, 0) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[0][1] > f[-1][1]` was true); `c` is a list with length `len(c) + 1` containing the original elements plus the new tuple (`y`, `x`, 2); `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**
