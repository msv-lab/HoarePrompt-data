The code snippet `print(*answer)` prints the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces. However, the list `answer` remains unchanged after this operation. The only change is that its elements are printed.

**Output State**: **`i` is `len(f) - 2`, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list of at least 3 elements, including \((1, 0, 0)\) and tuples \((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])\) where \( c[i][1] > f[-1][1] \) for \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \), `answer` is a list of `k` ones, `n`, `m`, and `k` are as given, `c` is a list of `k` tuples sorted based on the first element of each tuple, and the elements of `answer` are printed.**
