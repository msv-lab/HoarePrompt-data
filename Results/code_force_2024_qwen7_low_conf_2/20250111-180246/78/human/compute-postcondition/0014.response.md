The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in place. The list `c` contains `k` tuples, each with three elements `(y, x, i)`. Sorting this list in place means that the tuples within `c` will be rearranged based on the first element `y` of each tuple. The second and third elements (`x` and `i`) of each tuple remain unchanged. After sorting, the list `c` will be ordered based on the `y` values of the tuples.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`**
