The code `answer[f[-1][2]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the index in the `answer` list that corresponds to the third element (`f[-1][2]`) of the last tuple in the `f` list. 

Let's break down the impact:

1. The value of `answer[f[-1][2]]` is set to `1`. This means the `answer` list, which initially contained `k` zeros, now has its `f[-1][2]`-th element set to `1`.

The rest of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the number of tuples added to `f`, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including `(1, 0, 0)` and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros with the `f[-1][2]`-th element set to `1`, `i` is `k`, `k` is the number of tuples added to `f`.**
