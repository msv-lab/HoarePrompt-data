`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `x` and `y` will be integers. The values of `i`, `z`, `t`, `f`, `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial state. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `z` must be less than `t`, `f` is a list of `k` elements, `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` are as given, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input**
