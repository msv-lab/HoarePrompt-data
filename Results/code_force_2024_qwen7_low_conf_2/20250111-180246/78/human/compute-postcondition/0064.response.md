Postcondition: **`i` is in the range `[0, k-1]`, `f` is `[(1, 0, 0)]`, `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `s` is 0, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, and the current value of `c[i][1]` is greater than the first element of the last tuple in `f`.**
