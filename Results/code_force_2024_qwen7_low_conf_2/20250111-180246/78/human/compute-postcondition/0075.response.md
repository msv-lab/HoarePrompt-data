Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `f` is a list of four elements where the first three elements are the same as before and the fourth element is `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`. `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop. `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `s` is updated to `s + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, and `answer` is a list of `k` zeros.***
