The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is still equal to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `c` is a list containing two tuples \[(y, x, 0), (y, x, i)\], `x` is an integer from the split input, `y` is an integer from the split input, `i` is equal to `k`.**
