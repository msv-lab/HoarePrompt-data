The code `f = [(1, 0, 0)]` assigns a new list containing a single tuple `(1, 0, 0)` to the variable `f`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or the contents of the list `c`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, 0)`**
