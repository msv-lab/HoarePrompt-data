Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list containing the elements `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])` repeated, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is as given, `m` is as given, `k` is as given, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1` and is sorted based on the first element of each tuple, `s` is `(c[0][0] - 1) * (c[0][1] - f[-1][1])` if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.***
