`s` is assigned the value of `s` plus \((c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\). Given the initial conditions, \(c[i][1]\) is greater than \(f[-1][1]\), and both \(c[i][0]\) and \(f[-1][1]\) are integers. Since `s` was initially 0, the value of `s` will be updated based on the difference between `c[i][0]` and 1, multiplied by the difference between `c[i][1]` and `f[-1][1]`.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 0, 0)`, `s` is \((c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\), `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, the current value of `c[i][1]` is greater than the first element of the last tuple in `f`.**
