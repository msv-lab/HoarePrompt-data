Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list containing the elements `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is as given, `m` is as given, `k` is as given, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1` and is sorted based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., `y`), if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, `s` is `(y - 1) * x`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
