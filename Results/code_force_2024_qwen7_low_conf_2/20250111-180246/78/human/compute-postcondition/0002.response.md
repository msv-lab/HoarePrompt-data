The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial state is that `t` must be at least 1. After executing this code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
