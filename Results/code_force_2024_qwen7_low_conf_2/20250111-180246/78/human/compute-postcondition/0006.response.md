`c.append((y, x, i))` appends a tuple containing the values of `y`, `x`, and `i` to the list `c`. Since `i` is not defined before this line, it will take the default value of `0` when the list is appended. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `c` is a list containing one tuple `(y, x, 0)`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
