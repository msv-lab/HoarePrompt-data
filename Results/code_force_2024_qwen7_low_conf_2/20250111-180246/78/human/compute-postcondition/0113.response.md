To determine the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, let's break down the information provided and analyze the changes step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `z` is less than `t`
- `f` is a list containing the elements `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros
- `n` is as given
- `m` is as given
- `k` is as given
- `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1` and is sorted based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., `y`)
- If `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, then `s` is `(y - 1) * x`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `0`.

Since the loop is iterating over `i` from `0` to `k-1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`.

### Updated States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `1` (since `i` was `0` and it gets incremented by `1`).
- `z` remains less than `t` because the value of `z` does not change within the loop.
- `f` is a list containing the elements `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`. Since `i` changes to `1`, `f` will now contain `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])`.
- `answer` remains a list of `k` zeros because it does not get modified within the loop.
- `n` remains as given because it does not change.
- `m` remains as given because it does not change.
- `k` remains as given because it does not change.
- `c` remains the same list of tuples because it does not change within the loop.
- The condition for `s` is checked again, but since `i` changes to `1`, the value of `c[i][1]` will be used to update `s` if it meets the condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list containing the elements `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[1][0], c[1][1], c[1][2])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is as given, `m` is as given, `k` is as given, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1` and is sorted based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., `y`), if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, `s` is `(y - 1) * x`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.**
