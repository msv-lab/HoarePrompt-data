Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `z` is still less than `t`, `f` remains unchanged if `c[3][1]` is greater than the last element in `f`'s value at index 1; otherwise, `f` contains the additional element `(c[3][0], c[3][1], c[3][2])`. `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain the same in both cases. `s` is updated to the original value of `s` plus `(c[3][0] - 1) * (c[3][1] - f[-1][1])` if `c[3][1]` is greater than the last element in `f`'s value at index 1; otherwise, `s` remains the original value of `s`.***
