Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `z` must be less than `t`
   - `f` is a list of `k` elements
   - `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` are as given
   - `c` contains a new element `(y, x, 0)`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(k):`

3. **Increment of `i`:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

4. **Check for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `i` is less than `k`.

5. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Given `i` is currently 0, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`, and since `i` is now 1, `k` must be greater than 1.
   - Additionally, `z` must still be less than `t`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `z` must still be less than `t`.
   - `f` remains a list of `k` elements.
   - `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged.
   - `c` now contains the new element `(y, x, 0)`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 1, `z` must be less than `t`, `f` is a list of `k` elements, `answer`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` are as given, `c` contains a new element `(y, x, 0)`**
