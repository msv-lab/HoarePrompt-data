Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range \([1, \text{len}(f) - 1]\), `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list of at least 3 elements, `f` contains the element \((1, 0, 0)\), any tuples \((c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])\) where \( c[i][1] > f[-1][1] \) for \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \), `answer` is a list of \( k \) ones with either one or two elements set to \( 1 \) depending on whether the condition \( (f[i][0] < f[i + 1][0]) \) is satisfied, `n`, `m`, and `k` are as given, `c` is a list of \( k \) tuples of the form \((y, x, j)\) where \( j \) ranges from \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \) and `c` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple, `s` is the sum of \( (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1]) \) for all \( i \) where the condition is true.***
