`x` and `y` are assigned the values of two integers entered by the user using the `map(int, input().split())` function. This function splits the input based on spaces and converts each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `c` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `c` is a list containing one tuple `(y, x, 0)`, `x` is an input integer from the split input, `y` is an input integer from the split input**
