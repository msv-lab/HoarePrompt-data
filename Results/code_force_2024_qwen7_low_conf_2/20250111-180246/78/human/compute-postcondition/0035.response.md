The code snippet `answer[f[i][2]] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the index in the `answer` list that corresponds to the value of `f[i][2]`. Since `i` is initially `1`, this operation will set the `f[1][2]`-th element of `answer` to `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the updated information:
- `t` is at least `1`
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is the number of tuples added to `f`
- `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`
- `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including `(1, 0, 0)` and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true
- `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`
- `answer` is a list of `k` zeros with the `f[-1][2]`-th element set to `1` (now, the `f[1][2]`-th element is set to `1`)
- `i` is `1` after the assignment
- `k` is the number of tuples added to `f`
- the current value of `f[i][0]` is less than the value of `f[i + 1][0]`

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the number of tuples added to `f`, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including `(1, 0, 0)` and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `s` is the sum of `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` for all `i` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros with the `f[1][2]`-th element set to `1`, `i` is 1, `k` is the number of tuples added to `f`, and the current value of `f[i][0]` is less than the value of `f[i + 1][0]`**
