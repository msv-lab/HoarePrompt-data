The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned to these variables, while the other variables (`s`, `c`, `f`, `answer`, and `z`) remain unaffected in terms of their values or conditions.

Output State: **`s` is the sum of \((c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])\) for all `i` where `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, `n` is the input integer read, `m` is the input integer read, `k` is the input integer read, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples including \((1, 0, 0)\) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` was true, `answer` is \(s + (n - f[-1][1]) * m\), `z` is increased by 1**
