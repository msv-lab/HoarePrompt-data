Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`, `s` is either \( (c[i][0] - 1) \times (c[i][1] - f[-1][1]) \) if the condition `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]` is true, or remains 0, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.***
