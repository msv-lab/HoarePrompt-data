`s` is updated by adding the value `(c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])`. Given that `i` is initially 2, the value of `c[i][0]` is `c[2][0]`, and `c[i][1]` is `c[2][1]`. The value of `f[-1][1]` is the second element of the last tuple in `f`, which is `f[-1][1]`. Therefore, the new value of `s` is `s + (c[2][0] - 1) * (c[2][1] - f[-1][1])`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples sorted by their first element `y`, `f` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 0, 0)` and `(c[0][0], c[0][1], c[0][2])`, `s` is `s + (c[2][0] - 1) * (c[2][1] - f[-1][1])`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
