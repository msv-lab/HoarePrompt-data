The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and converts them into integers, assigning them to the variables `x` and `y`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the list `c` remains empty.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 1, `c` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
