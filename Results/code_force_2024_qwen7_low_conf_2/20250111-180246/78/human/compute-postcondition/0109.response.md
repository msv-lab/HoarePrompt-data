Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `z` is less than `t`, `f` is a list containing the element `(1, 0, 0)`, `answer` is a list of `k` zeros, `n` is as given, `m` is as given, `k` is as given, `c` is a list containing `k` tuples of the form `(y, x, j)` where `j` ranges from `0` to `k-1` and is sorted based on the first element of each tuple (i.e., `y`), the first element of `c[i]` is greater than the last element of `f` (i.e., `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`), `s` is 0**
