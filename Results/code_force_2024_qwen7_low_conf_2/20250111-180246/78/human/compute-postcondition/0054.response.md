The code `c.append((y, x, i))` appends a new tuple `(y, x, i)` to the list `c`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `c` is a list with `len(c) + 1` elements. After appending the new tuple, the length of `c` increases by 1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially, `c` contains up to `k` tuples, including `(1, 0, 0)` and possibly other tuples that meet the condition `c[0][1] > f[-1][1]`.
2. The new tuple `(y, x, i)` is appended to `c`.
3. Since `i` is initially 1, the new tuple becomes `(y, x, 1)`.
4. The length of `c` increases by 1, making the new length `len(c) + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` remains 1.
- `f` is unchanged.
- `c` now contains the original elements plus the new tuple `(y, x, 1)`.
- The length of `c` is now `len(c) + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `f` is a list containing up to `k` tuples (including (1, 0, 0) and tuples from `c` where the condition `c[0][1] > f[-1][1]` was true), `c` is a list with length `len(c) + 1` containing the original elements plus the new tuple (y, x, 1)**.
