Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range [1, k-1], `f` is a list of three elements where the first two elements are the same as before and the third element is `(c[i][0], c[i][1], c[i][2])`, `c` is a list of length `k` containing the tuples `(y, x, i)` for each iteration of the loop, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `s` is updated to `s + (c[i][0] - 1) * (c[i][1] - f[-1][1])` if `c[i][1] > f[-1][1]`, and `answer` is a list of `k` zeros.***
