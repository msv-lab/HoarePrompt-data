t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case consists of n, m, and k where 2 <= n, m <= 10^9 and 2 <= k <= 2 * 10^5. The coordinates of k fountains are given as pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) such that 1 <= r_i <= n and 1 <= c_i <= m, and all coordinates are distinct and none of them is (n, 1).
