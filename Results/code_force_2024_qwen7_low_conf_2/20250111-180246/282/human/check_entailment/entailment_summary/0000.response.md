Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to generate `n` distinct magic words and then respond to queries about the indices of the two magic words that form a given spell power.
- The core logic of the program seems to rely on a function `func_1` to generate unique identifiers for the substrings formed by concatenating pairs of magic words.
- The `func_1` function takes two parameters `a` and `b` and uses them to generate a unique identifier based on a specific formula. This identifier is then stored in a dictionary `q` to track which pairs of magic words produce a given substring.
- After generating the magic words and populating the dictionary `q`, the program processes queries by checking the dictionary to find the original magic words that produced the given spell power.

Given the constraints and the nature of the `func_1` function, it appears that the function will uniquely map pairs of indices to substrings, ensuring that the program can correctly identify the magic words used to form a spell.

Therefore, based on the execution summary and the provided code, the program should be able to correctly identify the indices of the magic words for any given spell power.

Correctness: **True**
