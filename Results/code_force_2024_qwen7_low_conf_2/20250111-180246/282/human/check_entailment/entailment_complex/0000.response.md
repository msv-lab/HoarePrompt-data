Reasoning:
1. **Magic Word Generation**: 
   - The program correctly generates `n` distinct magic words using the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` returns unique values for each pair `(i, j)` ensuring that the magic words generated are distinct and satisfy the required conditions.
   
2. **Query Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of queries `t` and then processes each query.
   - For each query, it reads the spell power `x` and uses the precomputed mapping `q` to find the indices `u` and `v` of the magic words that were concatenated to form the spell.
   - The indices are then printed in the correct order.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes a unique value based on the input parameters `a` and `b`. This value is used to ensure that each magic word is unique and that the spell power can be accurately mapped back to the original magic words.

4. **Correctness of the Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of generating unique magic words and mapping spell powers back to the original magic words is sound and correctly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
