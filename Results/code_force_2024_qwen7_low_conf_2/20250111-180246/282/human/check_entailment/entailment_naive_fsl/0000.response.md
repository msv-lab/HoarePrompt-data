Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate distinct magic words as required. The loop for generating magic words is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if any((func_1(i, j) in q for j in w))` and similar conditions do not guarantee that the generated magic words are distinct. This can lead to duplicate magic words being generated, which violates the requirement that the magic words must be distinct.

Additionally, the function `func_1` is used to create some kind of unique identifier, but it does not ensure that the generated strings are distinct. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
