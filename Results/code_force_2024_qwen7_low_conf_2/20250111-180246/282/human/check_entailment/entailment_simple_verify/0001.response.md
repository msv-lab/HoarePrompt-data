### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Magic Word Generation**:
   - The program aims to generate `n` distinct magic words. However, there is a critical issue in how the magic words are being generated. The function `func_1` generates a unique identifier for pairs of indices, but the actual generation of the magic words is flawed.
   - The current approach does not ensure that the magic words themselves are distinct. The logic in the while loop is designed to ensure that the identifiers generated by `func_1` are unique, but it does not guarantee that the magic words themselves are unique strings consisting of `X` and `O`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` generates unique identifiers based on the input indices. This part of the logic is correct in terms of ensuring uniqueness, but it doesn't address the issue of generating distinct magic words.
   - The formula in `func_1` is irrelevant to the actual content of the magic words, which should be constructed from `X` and `O`.

3. **Constructing Magic Words**:
   - The current implementation of constructing the magic words is not robust. The loop `for i in w: print('XO' + i * 'X')` does not produce distinct magic words. Instead, it simply prints a pattern that does not ensure uniqueness.
   - For example, if `n = 2`, the output might be `XOX` and `XOX`, which are not distinct.

4. **Retrieving Indices**:
   - The logic for retrieving the original indices from the identifiers in the dictionary `q` appears to be correct. However, this logic relies on the assumption that the magic words are distinct, which is not ensured by the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to generate distinct magic words. The logic in the while loop is designed to ensure unique identifiers but does not enforce the creation of unique magic words. Therefore, the program cannot satisfy the requirement of having `n` distinct magic words.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not generate distinct magic words, which is a fundamental requirement of the problem.
