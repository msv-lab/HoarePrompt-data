Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, there are several issues:

1. **Magic Word Generation**: 
   - The program generates `n` magic words by calling `func_1` for each index from 0 to `n-1`. However, the function `func_1` returns a numerical value rather than generating actual magic words. Moreover, the condition checks within the loop are based on the numerical values generated by `func_1`, which do not correspond to the generation of distinct magic words as required.

2. **Magic Words Structure**:
   - The magic words are expected to consist of characters 'X' and 'O'. However, the current implementation constructs strings using the numerical values returned by `func_1`, which do not represent valid magic words.

3. **Substrings Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not calculate the power of a spell by determining the number of different non-empty substrings. Instead, it returns a fixed numerical value based on the input indices, which is unrelated to the actual substring count of the concatenated magic words.

4. **Response to Students' Queries**:
   - When handling queries from students, the program correctly uses the dictionary `q` to map spell powers to the indices of the magic words. However, the values stored in `q` are based on the incorrect `func_1` values, not the actual substring counts of the magic words.

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to:
- Generate `n` distinct magic words consisting of 'X' and 'O'.
- Calculate the power of a spell as the number of different non-empty substrings of the concatenated magic words.
- Correctly match the given spell power to the indices of the magic words used to form that spell.

In summary, the current implementation fails to generate valid magic words and calculate the spell power accurately, thus it does not meet the problem description requirements.
