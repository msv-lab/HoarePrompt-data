### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

1. **Magic Word Generation**:
   - The program generates `n` distinct magic words using the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` generates a unique identifier based on the indices `i` and `j` using the formulae:
     - `(a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1` if `a >= b`
     - `(a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1` if `a < b`
   - This ensures that each pair of indices `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` will generate a unique identifier, allowing the program to track the unique pairs of magic words.
   - The program checks if the identifier is already in the dictionary `q` and continues if it is not, preventing duplicate pairs.

2. **Generating Magic Words**:
   - The magic words are generated such that each word is distinct and has a length within the specified bounds.
   - The magic words are stored in the list `w` and their identifiers are stored in the dictionary `q`.

3. **Handling Student Requests**:
   - For each student, the program reads the power of the spell `p_j`.
   - The power is determined by concatenating two randomly chosen magic words and counting the number of different non-empty substrings.
   - The program uses the dictionary `q` to retrieve the original indices of the two magic words that formed the spell with the given power.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate unique identifiers for pairs of indices, ensuring that the identifiers are unique for each pair of indices `(i, j)` and `(j, i)`.
   - The logic for generating these identifiers is correct and follows the problem's constraints.

### Challenges and Validation:
- **Uniqueness of Identifiers**:
  - The function `func_1` ensures that each pair of indices `(i, j)` and `(j, i)` generates a unique identifier. This is crucial for the program to correctly map the identifiers back to the original indices.
  - However, the program does not explicitly check if the generated magic words are indeed unique and distinct, although it is assumed based on the constraints that the generated identifiers are unique.

- **Correctness of Retrieval**:
  - The program uses the dictionary `q` to store the identifiers and map them back to the original indices. If the identifiers are correctly generated and stored, the retrieval should be correct.
  - The program correctly retrieves the original indices from the identifiers in the dictionary `q` and prints them in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem's requirements and constraints. The logic for generating unique identifiers and mapping them back to the original indices is sound. The use of the function `func_1` ensures that the identifiers are unique, and the program correctly retrieves the original indices from these identifiers.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the given problem description and function summaries.
