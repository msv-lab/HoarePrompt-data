State before the loop starts: `n` is 5.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop is defined as `for j in range(n):`.
2. The `range(n)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including `n`.
3. For the loop to execute, there must be at least one iteration. This means that the sequence generated by `range(n)` must have at least one element.
4. The sequence `range(n)` will have at least one element if `n` is greater than 0.
5. Since `n` is given as 5, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed 5 or greater to allow the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (but since it is given as 5, this condition is already met).

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1** (or simply `n` is 5, but the condition for the loop to execute is that `n > 0`).
