Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions:**
   - The loop variable `j` iterates from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is that `j` must be less than `n`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
   - `n` is at least the number of iterations that the loop executed (this is a post-loop condition and doesn't affect the initial state).
   - `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating all `words[i]` and `words[j]` for each iteration.
   - `powers[power]` contains the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for the last pair of `i` and `j` used in the loop.
   - `i` is `n` (at the start of the loop).

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to start executing, `j` must be able to take its first value, which is `0`.
   - Since `i` is `n`, and the loop starts iterating `j` from `0` to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `j < n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial value of `i` being `n` is correct since it is just a starting point and will change during the loop.
   - The initial value of `j` should be `0` for the loop to start.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `j` should be `0`.
- `n` should be at least `1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be at least 1, `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating all `words[i]` and `words[j]` for each iteration, `powers[power]` contains the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for the last pair of `i` and `j` used in the loop, `i` is `n`, `j` is `0`**
