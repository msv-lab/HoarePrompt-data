The code snippet `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` concatenates the strings at indices `i` and `j` in the list `words`. However, the initial state only mentions that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. There is no information about the list `words`, the values of `i` and `j`, or what `concatenated` is initialized to. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the concatenated string without more information.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`; the values of `i` and `j` are unknown; the value of `words` is unknown.**
