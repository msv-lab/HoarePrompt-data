Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`.
   - `powers[power]` is assigned `i + 1, j + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just finished executing for some value of `j`. This means `j` was the previous value of `j` minus 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 and must still be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given that the loop condition is `for j in range(n)`, the loop will continue if `j < n`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to check if `j+1 < n`.

4. **New State**:
   - `power` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `concatenated` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

If `j` was `j_prev` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `j_prev + 1`, and `j` must still be less than `n`.

**Final State**:
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1`, where `j_prev` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`**.
