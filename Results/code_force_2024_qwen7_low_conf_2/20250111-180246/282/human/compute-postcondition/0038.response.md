According to the given code, the loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:

- `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`.
- `i` is an index.
- `j` is an index, and at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was the value that made the loop stop (one less than it would be in the next iteration).
- `words` is a list of strings.
- `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `powers[power] = (i + 1, j + 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `j + 1`.

The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change in `j`. The other variables (`concatenated`, `i`, `words`, `power`, and `powers`) do not change based on the loop condition.

State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j + 1]`, `i` is an index, `j` is an index, and `words` is a list of strings; `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`; `powers[power] = (i + 1, j + 2)`**
