Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved**: The loop involves three main variables - `i`, `n`, and the `words` list. The variable `q` is not directly involved in the loop itself but is part of the initial state.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).
   - `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\).
   - `powers` is an empty dictionary.
   - Each magic word `w_i` in `words` is a string consisting of 'X' repeated `i` times followed by 'O' if `i` is odd, and no 'O' if `i` is even.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `i` must start at 0 (since `range(n)` starts at 0).
   - The variable `n` must be a valid value within the given range (\(1 \leq n \leq 1000\)) to ensure the loop can run at least once.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure there is at least one iteration.

5. **Summary of Adjusted States**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop runs.
   - `i` must start at 0 as per the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
