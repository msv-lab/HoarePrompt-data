`powers[power]` is assigned the value of `i + 1, j + 1`. The value of `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, but the specific value of `power` is not known. The values of `i` and `j` are also unknown, so they remain unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`; `powers[power]` is assigned `i + 1, j + 1`.

Output State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`; `powers[power]` is assigned `i + 1, j + 1`**
