The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function returns `(a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1`. Otherwise, it returns `(a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and based on the condition whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it returns one of the two specified expressions.
