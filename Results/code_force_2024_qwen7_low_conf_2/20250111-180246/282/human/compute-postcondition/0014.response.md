According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `power` is the length of the set of all possible substrings of `concatenated`, and `powers[power]` is `(2, 1)`. Since `j` starts from 0 and `n` must be at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `power` is the length of the set of all possible substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` is `(2, 1)`**
