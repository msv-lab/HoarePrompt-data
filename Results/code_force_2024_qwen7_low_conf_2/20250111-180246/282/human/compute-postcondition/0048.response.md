`q` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the values of `powers`, `words`, `concatenated`, and `power` also remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 1000, `powers` is a dictionary that maps unique substring lengths to tuples of indices (i+1, j+1), `words` is a list of strings where each string `w_i` is a sequence of 'X' repeated `i` times followed by 'O' if `i` is odd, and no 'O' if `i` is even, `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating every possible pair of strings from `words` in the form `words[i] + words[j]` for all `i` and `j` such that `0 ≤ i, j < n` and `i ≠ j`, `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `q` is an input integer**.
