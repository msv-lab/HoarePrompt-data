The code calculates the `power` by finding the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, which is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`. The variable `power` is assigned this value, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `words[i] + words[j]`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `concatenated` is `words[i] + words[j]`
- `j` is `j_prev + 1`

After executing the code, the value of `power` is updated to the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `concatenated` is `words[i] + words[j]`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`**
