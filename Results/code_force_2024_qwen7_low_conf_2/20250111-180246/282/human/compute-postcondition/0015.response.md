`concatenated` is assigned the value of `words[i] + words[j]`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, and assuming `words` is a list of strings, `concatenated` will be the concatenation of `words[1]` and `words[1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `power`, and `powers[power]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `power` is the length of the set of all possible substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` is (2, 1), `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[1]`**
