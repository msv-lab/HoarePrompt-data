Output State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be at least the number of iterations that the loop executed, `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating all `words[i]` and `words[j]` for each iteration, `powers[power]` contains the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for the last pair of `i` and `j` used in the loop.**
