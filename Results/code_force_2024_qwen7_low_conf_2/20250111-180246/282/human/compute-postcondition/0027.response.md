The code `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` assigns the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the key `power` in the dictionary `powers`. The values of `i` and `j` are updated based on their current values. 

From the initial state:
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `concatenated` is formed by concatenating `words[i]` and `words[j]` where `j` is `j_prev + 1`.

After executing the code:
- The dictionary `powers` gets updated with the key `power` having the value `(i + 1, j + 1)`.
- The values of `i` and `j` are increased by 1.

Output State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `concatenated` is `words[i] + words[j]`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `powers[power]` is `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
