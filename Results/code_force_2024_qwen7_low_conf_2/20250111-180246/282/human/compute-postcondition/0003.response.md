The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all pending output is written to the terminal. However, since this operation does not modify any variable's value, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, and `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 1000; each magic word `w_i` in `words` is a string consisting of 'X' repeated `i` times followed by 'O' if `i` is odd, and no 'O' if `i` is even.**
