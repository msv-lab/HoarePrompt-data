The code updates the dictionary `powers` such that the key `power` maps to a tuple containing `i + 1` and `j + 1`. The variables `concatenated`, `i`, `j`, `words`, and `power` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `i` is an index, `j` is an index, and `words` is a list of strings; `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`; `powers[power] = (i + 1, j + 1)`**
