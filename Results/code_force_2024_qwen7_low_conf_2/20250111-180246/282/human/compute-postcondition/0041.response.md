`powers[power]` is initially set to `(i + 1, j + 2)`. The code snippet changes this assignment to `powers[power] = (i + 1, j + 1)`. This means the second element in the tuple changes from `j + 2` to `j + 1`.

The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `i` is an index, `j` is an index, and `words` is a list of strings; `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`; `powers[power]` is now `(i + 1, j + 1)` instead of `(i + 1, j + 2)`.**
