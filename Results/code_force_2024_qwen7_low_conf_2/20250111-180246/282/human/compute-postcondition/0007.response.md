The code snippet `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` attempts to concatenate the strings at indices `i` and `j` in the list `words`. However, there is no list `words` defined in the initial state, and the indices `i` and `j` are not specified in the initial state. Since the code cannot execute without these variables being defined, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
