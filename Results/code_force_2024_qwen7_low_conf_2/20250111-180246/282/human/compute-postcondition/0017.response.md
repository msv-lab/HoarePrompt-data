The code updates the value of `powers[power]` to `i + 1, j + 1`. Given the initial state:
- `power` is 2
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1
Thus, `powers[2]` is updated to `(1 + 1, 1 + 1)`, which is `(2, 2)`.

The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `power`, and `concatenated` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `power` is 2, `powers[2]` is (2, 2), `concatenated` is `words[1] + words[1]`**
