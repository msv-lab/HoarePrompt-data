Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `concatenated` is `words[i] + words[j]`.
- `j` is `j_prev + 1`.
- `powers[power]` is `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.
2. **Initial Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j_prev + 1`.
3. **Increment of `j`**: In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Increment `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j_prev + 2`.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `n`.

### Updated States:
- `power` remains the same because the loop body is omitted and it does not affect `power`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `concatenated` remains the same because the concatenation is done based on `i` and `j` which will change but not the value of `concatenated` itself.
- `j` becomes `j_prev + 2`.
- `powers[power]` remains the same because the assignment only happens when `j == j_prev + 1`.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the state should be updated to reflect this condition.

**State:**
- `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `concatenated` is `words[i] + words[j]`.
- `j` is `j_prev + 2`.
- `powers[power]` is `(i + 1, j + 1)`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `concatenated` is `words[i] + words[j]`, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `powers[power]` is `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
