Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
  - `n` must be at least 1.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `j` is an unknown value.
  - `powers[power]` is `(1, j + 1)`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for j in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate as long as `j < n`.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `n` is at least 1 (so it is 1 or greater).
   - `i` is 1 (this value does not affect the loop directly).
   - `j` is an unknown value.
   - `powers[power]` is `(1, j + 1)`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`.
   - Since `n` is at least 1, `j` must be less than 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

### Adjusting States:
- `n` remains the same because the loop condition only depends on `j` relative to `n`.
- `i` remains 1 since it does not affect the loop condition.
- `j` must be less than `n`, which is 1. Therefore, `j` must be 0 for the loop to execute one more time.
- `powers[power]` remains `(1, j + 1)`, but since `j` changes, this will now be `(1, 1)`.

### Updated States:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` must be 0.
- `powers[power]` is `(1, 1)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` must be 0, `powers[power]` is `(1, 1)`**.
