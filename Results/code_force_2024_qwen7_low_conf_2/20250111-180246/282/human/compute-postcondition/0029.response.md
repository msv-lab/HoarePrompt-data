The code concatenates `words[i]` and `words[j]` into `concatenated`. This operation changes the value of `concatenated` but does not affect the other variables.

Output State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of the original `concatenated`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `concatenated` is now `words[i] + words[j]`, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `powers[power]` is `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
