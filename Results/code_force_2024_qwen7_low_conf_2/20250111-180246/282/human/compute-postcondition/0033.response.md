According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` must be at least the number of iterations that the loop executed, `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating all `words[i]` and `words[j]` for each iteration, and `powers[power]` contains the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for the last pair of `i` and `j` used in the loop.

Since the loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n - 1` (assuming the loop just finished). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n` and the condition `i < n` should still hold true.

Therefore, we need to update the state as follows:
- Increment `i` by 1, making `i` equal to `n`.
- Ensure `n` remains at least the number of iterations already executed.

State: **`power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `n` is at least the number of iterations that the loop executed, `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating all `words[i]` and `words[j]` for each iteration, `powers[power]` contains the indices `(i + 1, j + 1)` for the last pair of `i` and `j` used in the loop, `i` is `n`**.
