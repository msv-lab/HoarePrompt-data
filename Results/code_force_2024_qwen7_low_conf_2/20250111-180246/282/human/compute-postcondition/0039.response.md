The code `concatenated = words[i] + words[j]` updates the value of `concatenated` by concatenating the string at index `i` in the list `words` with the string at index `j` in the list `words`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `i` is an index, `j` is an index, and `words` is a list of strings; `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`; `powers[power] = (i + 1, j + 2)`**
