Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. It evaluates a condition to determine whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. Based on this condition, the function returns one of two possible expressions: `(a + 2) * (b + 4) - 1` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, or `(a + 5) * (b + 1) - 1` otherwise. There are no additional actions or side effects performed by the function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned one of the two specified expressions, depending on the values of `a` and `b`.**

This summary covers the core functionality of the function and ensures that all conditions and possible outcomes are included, without delving into the internal operations of the function.
