The code `powers[power] = i + 1, j + 1` updates the value of `powers[power]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `power` is the length of the set of all possible substrings of `concatenated`, and `powers[power]` is initially `(1, 1)`. After executing the code, `powers[power]` will be updated to `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which is `(1 + 1, 0 + 1)` or `(2, 1)`. The values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `power` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `power` is the length of the set of all possible substrings of `concatenated`, `powers[power]` is `(2, 1)`**
