The code `p = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `p`. This affects the variable `p` directly, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\), `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 1000\) and `q` must be greater than 0, `powers` is a dictionary that maps unique substring lengths to tuples of indices, `words` is a list of strings where each string `w_i` is a sequence of 'X' repeated `i` times followed by 'O' if `i` is odd, and no 'O' if `i` is even, `concatenated` is the final string formed by concatenating every possible pair of strings from `words` in the form `words[i] + words[j]` for all `0 \leq i, j < n` and `i \neq j`, `power` is the length of the set of all unique substrings of `concatenated`, `p` is an integer (the input value), `u` is the first element of the tuple in `powers[p]`, `v` is the second element of the tuple in `powers[p]`, and the values of `u` and `v` are printed.**
