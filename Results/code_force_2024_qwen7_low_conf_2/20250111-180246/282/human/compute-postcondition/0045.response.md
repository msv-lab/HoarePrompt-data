`powers[power]` is assigned the value `i + 1, j + 1`. This means that the dictionary `powers` will have the key `power` mapped to the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`concatenated` is the concatenation of `words[i]` and `words[j]`, `i` is an index, `j` is an index, and `words` is a list of strings; `power` is the number of unique substrings of `concatenated`; `powers[power]` is now `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
