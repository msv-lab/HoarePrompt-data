In the given code snippet, `powers[power]` is assigned the value `i + 1, j + 1`. However, the variables `i` and `j` are not defined in the initial state or within the snippet, which means their values are unknown. Since `i` is initially 0, `i + 1` would be 1. But without knowing the value of `j`, we cannot determine `j + 1`. 

The value of `power` is also not specified, but it is used as an index in the `powers` list. Assuming `power` is an integer, the code assigns a tuple `(1, j + 1)` to `powers[power]`.

Given this, the only known updated value from the code is `i` becoming 1, but the value of `j` remains unknown.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is an unknown value, `powers[power]` is `(1, j + 1)`.**
