Reasoning:
The given program appears to solve the problem correctly based on the provided execution summary. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `mn` and `mx` to track the minimum and maximum values of `cur`, and `cur` itself to 0.

2. **Iterating Through the String**: It iterates through each character `c` in the binary string `s`.
   - If the current count `cur` is even and the character `c` is '1', or if `cur` is odd and the character `c` is '0', it means the character maintains the parity, so `cur` is incremented.
   - Otherwise, `cur` is decremented.
   
3. **Tracking Minimum and Maximum Values**: For each character processed, the minimum and maximum values of `cur` are updated using `min` and `max` functions, respectively.

4. **Calculating Result**: Finally, the result for each test case is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur`, which effectively gives the minimum length of the folded strip.

This approach leverages the fact that a valid folding will ensure that matching characters align vertically after folding, and thus the `cur` variable keeps track of how far apart non-matching characters are, which directly correlates to the minimum possible length of the folded strip.

Given the explanation and the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the solution described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
