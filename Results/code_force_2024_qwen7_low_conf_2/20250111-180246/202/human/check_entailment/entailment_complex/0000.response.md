Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of the strip after performing valid folds.
2. The provided code processes each test case by iterating through the binary string `s` and tracking the parity-based changes in `cur`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if the current character `c` in the string `s` maintains the parity of the cumulative sum, updating `cur` accordingly.
4. `mn` and `mx` track the minimum and maximum values of `cur` encountered during the iteration.
5. The final result is calculated as `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folding.
6. The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the required minimum length for each test case.

Given the explanation, the code accurately follows the problem's requirements and logic, making the solution correct.

Correctness: **True**
