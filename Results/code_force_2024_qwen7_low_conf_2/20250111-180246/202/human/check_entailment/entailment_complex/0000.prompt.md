You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a961dc7cc221603a7d5a488247ba5439ce7444da.png)

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.

            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and remains unchanged, `s` is a binary string of length `n` and remains unchanged, `mn` is the overall minimum value that `cur` attains across all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the overall maximum value that `cur` attains across all iterations of the loop, `cur` is 0, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a variable `cur`, which changes based on the parity of the cumulative sum of the binary string `s`. Specifically, `cur` increases by 1 if the current character in `s` maintains the parity of the sum, and decreases by 1 otherwise. The function prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
