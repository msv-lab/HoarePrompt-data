### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folds.
   - A valid fold means that after folding, all characters on top of or below each other must match.
   - The length of the folded strip is determined by the maximum and minimum values of the cumulative count of '1's and '0's encountered so far.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the cumulative count `cur` changes direction (i.e., from increasing to decreasing or vice versa), it indicates a potential fold point.
   - The difference between the maximum (`mx`) and minimum (`mn`) values of `cur` gives the length of the strip after the folds.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The code iterates through the string `s` and maintains a cumulative count `cur` of '1's and '0's.
   - `cur` increments when encountering a '1' if the current parity matches the previous parity, otherwise, it decrements.
   - It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur`.
   - Finally, it calculates the difference `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the folded strip.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the minimum length is 1 because no folds are needed.
   - If the string alternates perfectly, the minimum length is also 1.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies fold points and calculates the minimum length.
   - The approach ensures that all characters on top of or below each other after folding match.
   - The solution handles both even and odd lengths of the string.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the strip after valid folds. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

**Correctness: **True**
