You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a961dc7cc221603a7d5a488247ba5439ce7444da.png)

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        mn = 0
        mx = 0
        cur = 0
        for c in s:
            if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
                cur = cur + 1
            else:
                cur = cur - 1
            mn = min(mn, cur)
            mx = max(mx, cur)
        print(mx - mn)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a variable `cur`, which changes based on the parity of the cumulative sum of the binary string `s`. Specifically, `cur` increases by 1 if the current character in `s` maintains the parity of the sum, and decreases by 1 otherwise. The function prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum length of the strip after valid folding. The logic in the `func_1` function calculates the minimum and maximum values of `cur` as it iterates through the string `s`. However, it fails to correctly handle the case where the string has an odd number of '1's and '0's, which is crucial for determining the minimum possible length after folding.

For instance, consider the string `s = "0110"`. The program incorrectly outputs `2`, but the correct minimum length after valid folding is `1`. This is because we can fold the string such that all '1's and '0's are on top of each other, resulting in a single character.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the parity of the counts of '1's and '0's and adjust the calculation accordingly. Specifically, if the counts of '1's and '0's are not equal, the minimum length will be 1, as all characters can be folded to overlap.
