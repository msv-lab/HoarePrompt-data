### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum length of the strip after valid folds where all characters on top of or below each other after folding must match.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A valid fold is defined such that after folding, all characters on top of or below each other must match.
   - The length of the folded strip is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the cumulative count of '1's and '0's encountered so far.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided code iterates through the string `s` and maintains a cumulative count `cur` of '1's and '0's.
   - `cur` increments by 1 if the current character in `s` maintains the parity of the sum, and decrements by 1 otherwise.
   - It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur`.
   - Finally, it calculates the difference `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the folded strip.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the minimum length is 1 because no folds are needed.
   - If the string alternates perfectly, the minimum length is also 1.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies fold points and calculates the minimum length.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with how the cumulative count `cur` is updated. The logic checks the parity of the cumulative sum, but it does not account for the alternating nature of the binary string correctly.

   Specifically, consider the following example:
   - Input: `101010`
   - The expected output should be 1, as the string can be folded into a single character.
   - The provided code will give a different result due to the way `cur` is updated.

   Let's walk through the example:
   - `s = "101010"`
   - `cur` starts at 0.
   - For '1': `cur` becomes 1 (parity matches).
   - For '0': `cur` becomes 0 (parity doesn't match, `cur` decrements).
   - For '1': `cur` becomes 1 (parity matches).
   - For '0': `cur` becomes 0 (parity doesn't match, `cur` decrements).
   - For '1': `cur` becomes 1 (parity matches).
   - For '0': `cur` becomes 0 (parity doesn't match, `cur` decrements).

   After processing the entire string, `cur` is 0, and `mx - mn` is 0, which is incorrect.

   The correct approach should be to ensure that the cumulative count `cur` reflects the alternating nature of the string correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code has a logical error in the way it updates the cumulative count `cur`. It does not correctly account for the alternating nature of the binary string, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

**Final: False**
