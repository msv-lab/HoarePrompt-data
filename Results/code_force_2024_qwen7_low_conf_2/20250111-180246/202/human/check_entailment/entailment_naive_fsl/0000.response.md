Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum length of the strip after valid folding. The logic in the `func_1` function calculates the minimum and maximum values of `cur` as it iterates through the string `s`. However, it fails to correctly handle the case where the string has an odd number of '1's and '0's, which is crucial for determining the minimum possible length after folding.

For instance, consider the string `s = "0110"`. The program incorrectly outputs `2`, but the correct minimum length after valid folding is `1`. This is because we can fold the string such that all '1's and '0's are on top of each other, resulting in a single character.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the parity of the counts of '1's and '0's and adjust the calculation accordingly. Specifically, if the counts of '1's and '0's are not equal, the minimum length will be 1, as all characters can be folded to overlap.
