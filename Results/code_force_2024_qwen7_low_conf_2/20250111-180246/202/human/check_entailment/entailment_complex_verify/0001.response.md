### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folds.
   - A valid fold means that after folding, all characters on top of or below each other must match.
   - The length of the folded strip is determined by the maximum and minimum values of a variable `cur`, which changes based on the parity of the cumulative sum of the binary string `s`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the cumulative count `cur` changes direction (i.e., from increasing to decreasing or vice versa), it indicates a potential fold point.
   - The difference between the maximum (`mx`) and minimum (`mn`) values of `cur` gives the length of the strip after the folds.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The code iterates through the string `s` and maintains a cumulative count `cur` of '1's and '0's.
   - `cur` increments by 1 when encountering a '1' if the current parity matches the previous parity, otherwise, it decrements.
   - It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur`.
   - Finally, it calculates the difference `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the folded strip.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the minimum length is 1 because no folds are needed.
   - If the string alternates perfectly, the minimum length is also 1.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies fold points and calculates the minimum length.
   - The approach ensures that all characters on top of or below each other after folding match.
   - The solution handles both even and odd lengths of the string.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly initializes variables `mn` and `mx` to 0.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the cumulative count of '1's and '0's.
   - The loop iterates through the string `s`, updating `cur` based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
   - The minimum and maximum values of `cur` are updated accordingly.
   - After the loop, the difference `mx - mn` is calculated and printed.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the strip after valid folds. The annotated code confirms that the program behaves as expected and correctly calculates the minimum length.
