You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a strip of paper with a binary string s of length n . You can fold
the paper in between any pair of adjacent digits.

A set of folds is considered valid if after the folds, all characters that are
on top of or below each other match. Note that all folds are made at the same
time, so the characters don't have to match in between folds.

For example, these are valid foldings of s = \mathtt{110110110011} and s =
\mathtt{01110} :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a961dc7cc221603a7d5a488247ba5439ce7444da.png)

The length of the folded strip is the length seen from above after all folds
are made. So for the two above examples, after the folds shown above, the
lengths would be 7 and 3 , respectively.

Notice that for the above folding of s = \mathtt{01110} , if we made either of
the two folds on their own, that would not be a valid folding. However,
because we don't check for validity until all folds are made, this folding is
valid.

After performing a set of valid folds, what is the minimum length strip you
can form?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the size of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters '0' and
'1' — a description of the digits on the strip.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum possible length of
the strip after a valid folding.

Note

For the first example case, one optimal folding is to fold the strip in the
middle, which produces a strip of length 3.

The third and fourth example cases correspond to the images above. Note that
the folding shown above for s = \mathtt{110110110011} is not of minimal
length.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and remains unchanged, `s` is a binary string of length `n` and remains unchanged, `mn` is the overall minimum value that `cur` attains across all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the overall maximum value that `cur` attains across all iterations of the loop, `cur` is 0, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folds.
   - A valid fold means that after folding, all characters on top of or below each other must match.
   - The length of the folded strip is determined by the maximum and minimum values of the cumulative count of '1's and '0's encountered so far.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the cumulative count `cur` changes direction (i.e., from increasing to decreasing or vice versa), it indicates a potential fold point.
   - The difference between the maximum (`mx`) and minimum (`mn`) values of `cur` gives the length of the strip after the folds.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The code iterates through the string `s` and maintains a cumulative count `cur` of '1's and '0's.
   - `cur` increments when encountering a '1' if the current parity matches the previous parity, otherwise, it decrements.
   - It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur`.
   - Finally, it calculates the difference `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the folded strip.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the minimum length is 1 because no folds are needed.
   - If the string alternates perfectly, the minimum length is also 1.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies fold points and calculates the minimum length.
   - The approach ensures that all characters on top of or below each other after folding match.
   - The solution handles both even and odd lengths of the string.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the strip after valid folds. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
