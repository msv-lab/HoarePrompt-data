### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum possible length of the strip after valid folds.
   - A valid fold means that after folding, all characters on top of or below each other must match.
   - The length of the folded strip is determined by the maximum and minimum values of the cumulative count of '1's and '0's encountered so far.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the cumulative count `cur` changes direction (i.e., from increasing to decreasing or vice versa), it indicates a potential fold point.
   - The difference between the maximum (`mx`) and minimum (`mn`) values of `cur` gives the length of the strip after the folds.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The code iterates through the string `s` and maintains a cumulative count `cur` of '1's and '0's.
   - `cur` increments when encountering a '1' if the current parity matches the previous parity, otherwise, it decrements.
   - It keeps track of the minimum and maximum values of `cur`.
   - Finally, it calculates the difference `mx - mn`, which represents the minimum possible length of the folded strip.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the minimum length is 1 because no folds are needed.
   - If the string alternates perfectly, the minimum length is also 1.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies fold points and calculates the minimum length.
   - The approach ensures that all characters on top of or below each other after folding match.
   - The solution handles both even and odd lengths of the string.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code provides clear states before and after the loop execution.
   - The `cur` variable tracks the cumulative count of '1's and '0's, adjusted based on the parity of the sequence.
   - `mn` and `mx` store the minimum and maximum values of `cur` during the iteration.
   - The final calculation of `mx - mn` gives the desired result.

7. **Validation Against Example:**
   - For the example provided:
     - `s = "101101"`, the `cur` values would be `[1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0]`. The `mn` is `-2` and `mx` is `1`, so `mx - mn = 3`.
     - `s = "01110"`, the `cur` values would be `[1, 0, -1, -2, -3]`. The `mn` is `-3` and `mx` is `1`, so `mx - mn = 4`.
   - The program outputs the correct results for these examples.

Based on the detailed analysis and validation against the annotated code and example inputs, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the folded strip.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the strip after valid folds. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
