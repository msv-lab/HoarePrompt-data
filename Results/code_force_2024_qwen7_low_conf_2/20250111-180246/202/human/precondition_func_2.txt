t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string s, and s is a string consisting of '0' and '1'. The variable `func_2` is another function that processes the string s and returns an integer value k, which represents the minimum possible length of the strip after a valid folding. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
