The function processes multiple test cases, each including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of a variable `cur`, which changes based on the parity of the cumulative sum of the binary string `s`. Specifically, `cur` increases by 1 if the current character in `s` maintains the parity of the sum, and decreases by 1 otherwise. The function prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values of `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
