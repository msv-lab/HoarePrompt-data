The function `func_2` accepts a binary string `s` and a list `pi` computed by `func_1(s)`, where `pi` represents the longest prefix which is also a suffix for each prefix of `s`. The function calculates and returns `k`, which is equal to `n - pi[-1]`, where `n` is the length of the binary string `s`. This value `k` represents the difference between the length of the string and the length of the longest palindromic prefix of the string. The function handles the case where the length of the string `n` is between 1 and \(2 \times 10^5\). No edge cases are explicitly mentioned in the provided code, but the function assumes that `s` is a valid non-empty binary string and that `pi` is correctly computed by `func_1(s)`.
