Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 1. If the current character `cur` is even and the previous character in the string `s` is '1', then `cur` is the next character in the string `s`. Otherwise, `cur` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the original `cur` minus 1.***
