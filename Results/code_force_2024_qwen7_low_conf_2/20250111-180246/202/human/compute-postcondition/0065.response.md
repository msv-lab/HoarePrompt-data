`cur` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is 0, so after incrementing, `cur` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`total`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 1, `c` is either '0' or '1' depending on whether `cur` is even or odd**
