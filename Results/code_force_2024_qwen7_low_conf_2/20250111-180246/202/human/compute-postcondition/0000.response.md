`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. This means `t` now holds the value entered as an integer, while the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and holds the input integer; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and remains unchanged; `s` is a binary string of length n and remains unchanged.**
