Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length 0 and must be empty; `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop; `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the binary string `s`.
- For each character `c` in `s`, `cur` is incremented or decremented based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
- `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur` during each iteration.
- `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur` during each iteration.
- After the loop completes, `cur` will return to 0 because the loop increments or decrements `cur` but it will eventually settle back to 0 when there are no more characters to process in `s`.

Since the loop processes each character in `s`, and the final state of `cur` is reset to 0 after processing all characters, the values of `mn` and `mx` reflect the minimum and maximum values that `cur` takes during the loop. The length of `s` becomes 0 by the end of the loop, making `s` an empty string. Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is as stated above.
