Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `c` is the first character of `s`, and either (`cur % 2 == 0` and `c != '1')` or (`cur % 2 != 0` and `c == '1')**
