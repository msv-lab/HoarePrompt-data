Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variable and its initial state**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. This means that at the start of the loop, `c` should be initialized to the first character of the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `s`**: Since `s` is a binary string of length `n`, we need to ensure that `s` has a valid length. However, since the loop will iterate over each character in `s`, we don't need to adjust `n` itself; we just need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty binary string.

3. **Initial values of other variables**: The variables `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` are all set to 0 initially. These values will change within the loop but do not affect the condition for entering the loop.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0 (no adjustment needed as it's already stated).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) (no adjustment needed as it's already stated).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` (no adjustment needed as it's already stated).
- `mn` is 0 (no adjustment needed as it's already stated).
- `mx` is 0 (no adjustment needed as it's already stated).
- `cur` is 0 (no adjustment needed as it's already stated).

The only thing that needs to be explicitly mentioned is that `c` should be initialized to the first character of `s` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `c` is the first character of `s`**
