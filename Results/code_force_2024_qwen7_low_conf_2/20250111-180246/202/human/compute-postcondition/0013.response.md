The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates `mn` to be the minimum value between `mn` and `cur`. Since the initial state does not specify exact values for `mn` and `cur`, we consider the general case.

- Initially, `mn` is 0.
- `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1 based on the condition given in the initial state.

Given the condition for `cur`:
- If `cur % 2 == 0` and `c == '1'` or `cur % 2 != 0` and `c != '1'`, then `cur` is `cur + 1`.
- Otherwise, `cur` is -1.

Since `mn` starts as 0, the value of `cur` will determine `mn` after the assignment. The minimum value between `mn` (initially 0) and `cur` will be updated accordingly. If `cur` is less than 0, `mn` will become the value of `cur`. If `cur` is greater than or equal to 0, `mn` will remain 0 because 0 is the minimum value between 0 and any non-negative number.

Therefore, after executing the line `mn = min(mn, cur)`, the value of `mn` will be the minimum value between 0 and `cur`.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1, `c` is the first character of `s`.**
