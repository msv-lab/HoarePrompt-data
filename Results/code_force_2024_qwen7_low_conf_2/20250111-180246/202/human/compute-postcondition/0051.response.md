The code `cur = cur - 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. According to the initial state, `cur` was `k - 1`. Therefore, after the decrement, `cur` becomes `k - 2`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'` if `cur` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, otherwise `mn` and `mx` remain 0; `cur` is `k - 2`.**
