Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and remains unchanged, `s` is a binary string of length `n` and remains unchanged, `mn` is the overall minimum value that `cur` attains across all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the overall maximum value that `cur` attains across all iterations of the loop, `cur` is 0, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
