According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Let's break it down:

- The variable `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
- The variables `n` and `s` remain unchanged and their values do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, given the constraints provided.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and remains unchanged, `s` is a binary string of length \(n\) and remains unchanged**
