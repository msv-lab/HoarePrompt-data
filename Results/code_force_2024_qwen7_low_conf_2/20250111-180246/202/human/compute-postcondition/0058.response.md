`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `n` is obtained from user input, and it is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length 0, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, the value printed is `mx - mn`, `cur` is 0**
