`cur` is incremented by 1. Given that `cur` was either `cur + 1` or -1, now `cur` will be `cur + 2`. The value of `mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`, which means `mn` remains 0 because `cur` was at most -1 and now it's 1, so the minimum remains 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mx`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mn` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`, `cur` is `cur + 2`, `c` is the second character of `s`**
