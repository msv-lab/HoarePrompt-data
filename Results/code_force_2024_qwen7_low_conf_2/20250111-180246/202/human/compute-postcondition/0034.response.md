The variable `cur` is initialized to 0. This initializes `cur` but does not change its value since no further operations are performed on `cur` in this snippet. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.**
