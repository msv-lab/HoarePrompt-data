`input()` reads a line of text from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the initial condition that `s` is a binary string of length `n` still holds.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n` and equals the input string read from the standard input**
