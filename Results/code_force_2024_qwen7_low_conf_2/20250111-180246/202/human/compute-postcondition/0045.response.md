The code `cur = cur - 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Given that `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur`, and `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, otherwise 0, the values of `mn` and `mx` will be updated based on the new value of `cur`.

Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `cur`, we will use the general logic to determine the updated values of `mn` and `mx`:

- If `cur` was originally 1, then `mx` was 1. After decrementing `cur` by 1, `cur` becomes 0, so `mx` becomes 0.
- If `cur` was originally greater than 1, then `mx` was 0. After decrementing `cur` by 1, `cur` becomes `cur - 1`, which is now less than or equal to 0, so `mx` remains 0.

In both cases, `mn` will be 0 because it is the minimum of 0 and `cur`, and `cur` is now less than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is `cur - 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is `cur - 1`.**
