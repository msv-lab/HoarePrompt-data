The code `cur = cur - 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. According to the initial state, `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`. Since the exact value of `cur` was not specified in the initial state, we will keep it in terms of the condition.

After decrementing `cur` by 1, the new value of `cur` will be one less than its original value. However, the exact value of `cur` before this operation was dependent on the condition, and the same condition will apply to the new value of `cur`.

The other variables (`mn`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mx`, and `c`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 1` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `c` is the third character of `s`.**
