According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `c`, which is the current character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur`; `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, otherwise 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; and `s` is now defined.

The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the string `s` must still contain characters to iterate over.

Since `s` is a binary string of length `n` and it must not be empty, at the start of the next iteration, `s` should have at least one less character than it had before the last iteration.

Let's denote the length of `s` at the end of the previous iteration as `len(s)`.

- Before the last iteration, `len(s) = n`.
- After processing one character in the loop, `len(s)` is reduced by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `len(s)` will be \(n - 1\).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- The string `s` should now be a binary string of length \(n - 1\).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `mn`, `mx`) remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur`; `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, otherwise 0**
