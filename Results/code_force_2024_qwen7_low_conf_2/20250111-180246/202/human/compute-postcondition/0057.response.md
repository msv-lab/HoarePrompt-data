According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop runs for each value of `_` in the range from 0 to `t-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t > 1\).

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur`) remain unchanged because the problem statement does not specify how they are affected by the loop body or any conditions under which they might change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t > 1\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length 0, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, the value printed is `mx - mn`, `cur` is 0**. 

However, to explicitly state the adjustment for `t`, we can say:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length 0, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, the value printed is `mx - mn`, `cur` is 0**.
