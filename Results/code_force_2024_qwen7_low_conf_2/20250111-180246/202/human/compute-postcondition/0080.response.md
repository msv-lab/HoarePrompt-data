Postcondition: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0. If the current character `cur` is even and the previous character `c` is '1', then `cur` is increased by 1, `mx` is the maximum of 1 and `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `cur` is decreased by 1, and `mx` remains as the maximum of 1 and `cur`.**
