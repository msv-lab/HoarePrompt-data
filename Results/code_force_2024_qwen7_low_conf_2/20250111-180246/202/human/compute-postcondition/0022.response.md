`cur` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` was either `cur + 2` or `0` based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`. However, the exact value of `cur` before this increment is not specified, only the condition that it was either `cur + 2` or `0`. After incrementing, `cur` will now be one more than its previous value.

Since the increment does not affect `mn`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mx`, or `c`, these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`, `cur` is one more than its previous value either `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `c` is the third character of `s`.**
