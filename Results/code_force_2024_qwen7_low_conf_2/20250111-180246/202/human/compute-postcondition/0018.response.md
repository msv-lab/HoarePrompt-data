Postcondition: ***`mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 2` or 0 depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `c` is the second character of `s`***
