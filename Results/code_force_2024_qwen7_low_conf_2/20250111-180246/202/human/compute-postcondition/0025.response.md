The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates `mn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cur`. Given that `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, or `cur + 1` or `0` if `(cur % 2 != 0) == (c == '1')`, and considering `c` is the third character of `s`, `mn` will now be updated to the minimum of its current value and `cur`.

The initial state is:
- `mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`
- `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`
- `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, or `cur + 1` or `0` if `(cur % 2 != 0) == (c == '1')`

After executing the line `mn = min(mn, cur)`, `mn` will be updated to be the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`. 

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`; `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, or `cur + 1` or `0` if `(cur % 2 != 0) == (c == '1')`.**
