The code `cur = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cur`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur`) are updated as follows:

- `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `s` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `mn` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `mx` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the code.
- `cur` is now 0.

The value printed is `mx - mn`, which remains unchanged as `mx` and `mn` are not modified.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of the user input, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
