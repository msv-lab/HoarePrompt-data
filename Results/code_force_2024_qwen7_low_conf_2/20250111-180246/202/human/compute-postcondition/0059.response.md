The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length 0, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, the value printed is `mx - mn`, and `cur` is 0. After executing the line `s = input()`, the value of `s` is updated, but the other variables remain in their initial states except that `s` now holds the user input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of the user input, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, the value printed is `mx - mn`, `cur` is 0.**
