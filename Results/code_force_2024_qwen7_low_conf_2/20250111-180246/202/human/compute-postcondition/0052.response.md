Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'` if `cur` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, otherwise `mn` and `mx` remain 0; `cur` is either `k` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` or `k - 2` if `(cur % 2 == 0) != (c == '1')`.***
