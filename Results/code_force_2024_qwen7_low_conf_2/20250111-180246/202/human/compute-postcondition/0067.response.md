The value of `cur` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is 0, so after executing `cur = cur - 1`, the value of `cur` becomes -1. The other variables (`total`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) != (c == '1')`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is -1, `(cur % 2 == 0) != (c == '1')`**
