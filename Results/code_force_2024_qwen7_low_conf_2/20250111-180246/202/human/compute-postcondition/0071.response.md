According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The loop condition is based on the variable `c`, which is the current character being processed in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `total` is 10
- `s` is a non-empty binary string
- `mn` is 0
- `mx` is 1
- `cur` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one character left in the string `s` to process. Since `s` is a non-empty binary string, it contains at least one character. After processing the current character, `c` will be the next character in the string.

The state of `total`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` does not change directly by the loop itself, but rather by the operations within the loop body. However, the key point here is that for the loop to continue, `s` must still contain characters.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` must still be a non-empty binary string (meaning it should have at least one character left).
- `total` remains 10.
- `mn` remains 0.
- `mx` remains 1.
- `cur` will be updated to the value of the next character in the string `s`.

State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 1, `cur` is the next character in the string `s`**
