The code `print(mx - mn)` simply calculates the difference between `mx` and `mn` and prints it. Since the values of `mx` and `mn` are already determined from the initial state, no changes are made to these variables, and the print statement just outputs their difference.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
