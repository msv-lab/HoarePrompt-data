Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, otherwise 0; `mx` is 1 if `cur + 1` is 1, otherwise 0, if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`; otherwise, `mn` is 0 and `mx` is 0, and `cur` is decremented by 1.**
