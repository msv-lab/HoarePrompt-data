The code snippet updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Since the initial state does not specify a specific value for `cur`, `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value (`mx`) and `cur`.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and the new value of `cur`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mx` is the maximum of its current value and `cur`; `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, or `cur + 1` or `0` if `(cur % 2 != 0) == (c == '1')`.**
