The code `cur = cur - 1` decrements the value of `cur` by 1. According to the initial state, `cur` is initially 0, so after this operation, `cur` will become `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is -1; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined; the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` is false**
