The code initializes a new variable `mx` and sets it to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mn`. Therefore, the only change is that `mx` is now 0.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0**
