`mn` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `mn` to 0. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `mn` being 0, while other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mx`, `cur`) retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is 0; `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.**
