Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
   - `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop.
   - `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop.
   - `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`.
   - The value printed is `mx - mn`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `t` times.

3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the variable `t` must be greater than 0 and there should be at least one more iteration left.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and we know that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, we decrement `t` by 1 to represent one iteration completed.
   - `n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` remain unchanged because these values are specific to the current iteration of `s` and do not affect the outer loop control variable `t`.

5. **New State**: After decrementing `t` by 1, `t` will be one less than its previous value, but still greater than 0 as long as it was originally at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`; the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
