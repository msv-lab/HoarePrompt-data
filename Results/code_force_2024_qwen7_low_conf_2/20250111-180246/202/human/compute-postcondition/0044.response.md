The code `cur = cur + 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since the initial value of `cur` is not explicitly given, we denote it as an integer `cur`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mn`, and `mx`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur`; `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, otherwise 0; `cur` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1`; `mx` is 1 if `cur + 1` is 1, otherwise 0; `cur` is `cur + 1`.**
