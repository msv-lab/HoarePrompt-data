The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was previously the next character in `s` if `prev_char` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise `cur` is the ASCII value of the next character in `s` minus 1, and considering `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `cur` is now one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is the maximum of 1 and `cur + 1`, `cur` is the next character in `s` if `prev_char` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise `cur` is the ASCII value of the next character in `s` minus 1 and `cur` is increased by 1**
