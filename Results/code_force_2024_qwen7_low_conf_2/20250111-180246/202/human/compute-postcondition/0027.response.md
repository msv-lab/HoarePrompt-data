Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all iterations.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
- `mn` is 0.
- `mx` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for c in s:
    if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
        cur = cur + 1
    else:
        cur = cur - 1
    mn = min(mn, cur)
    mx = max(mx, cur)
```

### Observations from the Provided Output States:
- The loop updates `cur` based on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
- `mn` is updated to be the minimum value between itself and the current value of `cur`.
- `mx` is updated to be the maximum value between itself and the current value of `cur`.

### Final Values After All Iterations:
- Since the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`, the value of `cur` will depend on the sequence of characters in `s` and whether the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` holds true.
- `mn` will be the minimum value that `cur` attains during any iteration.
- `mx` will be the maximum value that `cur` attains during any iteration.
- `cur` will end up being the final value after iterating through all characters in `s`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute exactly `n` times since `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
- Therefore, the final values of `cur`, `mn`, and `mx` will be determined by the sequence of characters in `s` and the condition applied.

### Output State:
**Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`.**
