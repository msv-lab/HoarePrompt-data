Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined. The current value of `cur` is 0 and the current character `c` in the string `s` is being processed such that (`cur % 2 == 0`) is equal to (`c == '1'`)**
