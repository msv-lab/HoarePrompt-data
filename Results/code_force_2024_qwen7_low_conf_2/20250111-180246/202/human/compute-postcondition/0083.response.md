Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a binary string of the user input.
- `mn` is 0.
- `mx` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.
- The value printed is `mx - mn`.

### Loop Code
```python
for c in s:
    if (cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1'):
        cur = cur + 1
    else:
        cur = cur - 1
    mn = min(mn, cur)
    mx = max(mx, cur)
```

### Analysis of the Loop
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` checks whether `cur` is even and `c` is '1', or `cur` is odd and `c` is '0'.
   - If the condition is true, `cur` is incremented by 1.
   - If the condition is false, `cur` is decremented by 1.

2. **Effect on `cur`**:
   - The value of `cur` toggles between even and odd depending on the characters in `s`.
   - For every '1', if `cur` is even, it becomes odd, and if `cur` is odd, it becomes even.
   - For every '0', if `cur` is even, it becomes even, and if `cur` is odd, it becomes odd.

3. **Effects on `mn` and `mx`**:
   - `mn` keeps track of the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
   - `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.

### Final State After All Iterations
- Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `cur` will toggle between even and odd values depending on the sequence of '0's and '1's in `s`.
- The final value of `mn` will be the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- The final value of `mx` will be the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.

### Conclusion
The loop will always execute at least once since `s` is a non-empty binary string. Therefore, the values of `mn` and `mx` will be determined by the sequence of '0's and '1's in `s`.

### Output State
- `s` is a non-empty binary string.
- `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop.
- The value printed is `mx - mn`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` encountered during the loop, and the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
