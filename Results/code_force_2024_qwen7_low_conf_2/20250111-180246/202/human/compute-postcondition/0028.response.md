The code snippet `print(mx - mn)` does not change any variables directly. Instead, it prints the difference between `mx` and `mn`. Given the initial conditions, `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop, and `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop. The final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s` is stored in `cur`, but this value is not used in the print statement.

Since the code only prints the difference and does not modify any variables, the values of `mx`, `mn`, `cur`, `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`; the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
