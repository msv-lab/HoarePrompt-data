The code snippet reads an input string into the variable `s`. This means that the string `s` is now defined, and all other variables remain in their initial states. The value of `n` remains an integer obtained from input, `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), `mn` and `mx` remain the minimum and maximum values of `cur` respectively, and `cur` remains the final value after iterating through all characters in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.**
