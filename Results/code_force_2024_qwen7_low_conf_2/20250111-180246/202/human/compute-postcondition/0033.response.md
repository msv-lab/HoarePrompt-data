The code assigns the value `0` to `mx`. This means that `mx` is now explicitly set to `0`, regardless of its previous value during the loop or before. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.**
