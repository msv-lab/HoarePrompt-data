`mx` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `cur`. Since `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1, and the initial value of `mx` is 0, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and `cur`. The value of `cur` will be either `cur + 1` or -1, but `mx` will be updated accordingly. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

- If `cur` is `-1`, then `mx` remains `0`.
- If `cur` is `cur + 1`, then `mx` will be `cur + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`; `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1; `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`; `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1; `c` is the first character of `s`.**
