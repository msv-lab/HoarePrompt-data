The variable `cur` is assigned the value `0`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mn`, and `mx`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0**
