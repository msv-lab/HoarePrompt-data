State before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
2. **Initialization and Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
3. **Variables Involved**:
   - `s`: The string whose characters are being iterated over.
   - `cur`: Accumulates some value based on the current character `c`.
   - `mn` and `mx`: Track the minimum and maximum values of `cur` across iterations.

For the loop to execute:
- The string `s` must be non-empty, meaning it must have at least one character.
- The variable `s` must be properly defined and contain a binary string.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the string `s` has at least one character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty; `mn` is 0; `mx` is 0; `cur` is 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.**
