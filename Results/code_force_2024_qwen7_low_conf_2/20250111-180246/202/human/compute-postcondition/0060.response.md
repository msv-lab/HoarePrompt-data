The code snippet sets `mn` to 0. Since `mn` was previously the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, setting it to 0 does not affect the values of `cur` or the computation of `mx - mn`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of the user input, `mn` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop, the value printed is `mx - mn`, `cur` is 0.**
