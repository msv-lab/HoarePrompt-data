The function `func_1` does not directly accept any parameters as written (`def func_1():`). However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it appears that the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a binary string `s`.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

- The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes an integer `t` where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each test case also includes an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- Each test case further includes a binary string `s` of length `n`.

Given the output structure is not specified, we will assume the function returns some result after processing all test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a binary string `s` of length `n`. After processing all test cases, it returns some result.**
