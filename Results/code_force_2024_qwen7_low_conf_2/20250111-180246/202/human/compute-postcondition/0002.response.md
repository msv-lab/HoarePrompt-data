`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `s` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and is equal to the integer entered by the user, `s` is a binary string of length \(n\).
