The code snippet assigns the value of `input()` to the variable `n`. The previous values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, `cur`) are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `n` is an integer obtained from the input, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n`; `mn` is the minimum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `mx` is the maximum value that `cur` attains during the loop; `cur` is the final value of `cur` after iterating through all characters in `s`; the value printed is `mx - mn`.**
