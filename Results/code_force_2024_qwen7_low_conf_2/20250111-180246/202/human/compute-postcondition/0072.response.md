The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was the next character in the string `s`, and strings in Python are zero-indexed, incrementing `cur` by 1 means it now points to the next character in the string. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 1, `cur` is the next character in the string `s` which is now one index ahead.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 1, `cur` is the next character in the string `s` which is now one index ahead.**
