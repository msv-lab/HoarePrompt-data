`cur` is decremented by 1. The initial state is that `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1. After decrementing, the value of `cur` will be either `cur + 2` or 0. The states of the other variables (`mn`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mx`, and `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 2` or 0, `c` is the second character of `s`**
