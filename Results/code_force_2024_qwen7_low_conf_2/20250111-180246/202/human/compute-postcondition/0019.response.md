The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` updates `mn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cur`. Since `cur` can either be `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `mn` is initially the minimum value between `0` and `cur`, we need to consider the two cases for `cur`.

1. If `cur % 2 == 0` and `c == '1'`, then `cur` remains unchanged.
2. If `cur % 2 != 0` or `c != '1'`, then `cur` becomes `0`.

Let's analyze both cases:

- Case 1: If `cur % 2 == 0` and `c == '1'`, then `cur` remains unchanged. So, `mn` is updated to `min(mn, cur)`.
- Case 2: If `cur % 2 != 0` or `c != '1'`, then `cur` becomes `0`. So, `mn` is updated to `min(mn, 0)`, which simplifies to `0` because `0` is the minimum value.

Since `mn` starts as the minimum value between `0` and `cur`, in both cases, `mn` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and either `cur` or `0`. Given that `mn` starts as the minimum value, it will remain the same unless `cur` becomes `0`, which happens only in the second case.

Therefore, the value of `mn` will be updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, but since `cur` can become `0` only in one case, the final value of `mn` will depend on whether `cur` is `0` or not. However, without knowing the exact value of `cur`, we can say that `mn` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 2` or 0 depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `c` is the second character of `s`.**
