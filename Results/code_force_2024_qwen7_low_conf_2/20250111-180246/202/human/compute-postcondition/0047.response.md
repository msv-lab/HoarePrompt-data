The code snippet updates the variable `mn` by taking the minimum of its current value and `cur`. Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. Initially, `mn` is defined as the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, otherwise 0. This means:
   - If `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, then `mn` is `min(0, cur + 1)`.
   - Otherwise, `mn` is 0.

2. The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` simply updates `mn` to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty.
- `mn` is initially defined as the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, otherwise 0.
- `mx` is 1 if `cur + 1` is 1, otherwise 0, if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`; otherwise, `mn` is 0 and `mx` is 0.
- `cur` is decremented by 1.

After the code `mn = min(mn, cur)` is executed:
- `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (which could be 0 or `cur + 1` under certain conditions) and `cur`.

Since `cur` is being decremented by 1, the value of `cur` itself is relevant. However, without knowing the exact value of `cur` and `c`, we can't determine the exact new value of `mn`. But we know that `mn` cannot be greater than `cur` after this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, otherwise 0, and `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`; `mx` is 1 if `cur + 1` is 1, otherwise 0, if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`; otherwise, `mn` is 0 and `mx` is 0; `cur` is decremented by 1.**
