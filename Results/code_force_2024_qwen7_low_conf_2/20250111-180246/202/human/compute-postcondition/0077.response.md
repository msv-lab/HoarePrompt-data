Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 10
- `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining
- `mn` is 0
- `mx` is the maximum of 1 and `cur`
- `cur` is the next character in `s` if `prev_char` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise `cur` is the ASCII value of the next character in `s` minus 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for c in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Character `c`**: The loop variable `c` will take on each character of the string `s` in order.
2. **Condition for Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `s`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since we are starting a new iteration of the loop, the variable `c` will now be the next character in `s`.
- The variable `s` will be the remaining substring of `s` after removing the current character `c`.
- The variable `cur` will be updated based on the rules given.
- `mn` and `mx` will remain the same unless the loop body changes them, but since no such change is specified, they stay as they were.

### Updated States:
- `total` remains unchanged at 10.
- `s` is now a non-empty binary string with at least one character less than before.
- `mn` remains 0.
- `mx` remains the maximum of 1 and `cur`.
- `cur` is the next character in the new `s` if `prev_char` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise `cur` is the ASCII value of the next character in `s` minus 1.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is the maximum of 1 and `cur`, `cur` is the next character in `s` if `prev_char` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise `cur` is the ASCII value of the next character in `s` minus 1**
