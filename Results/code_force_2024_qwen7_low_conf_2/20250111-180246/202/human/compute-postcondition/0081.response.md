The code `mn = min(mn, cur)` assigns the minimum value between `mn` and `cur` to `mn`. Given the initial state where `total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, and considering that `cur` is updated based on whether the current character in `s` (denoted as `cur`) is even and the previous character (`c`) is '1', we need to determine the new value of `mn`.

Since `cur` is updated within a loop based on the conditions provided, and initially `mn` is 0, the new value of `mn` will be the minimum between the original `mn` (which is 0) and the current value of `cur`.

Let's assume the first character in the binary string `s` is processed, and it meets the condition where `cur` is increased by 1 if it is even and the previous character `c` is '1'. Since `cur` starts from the first character of `s`, which could be either '0' or '1', and `mn` is initially 0:

- If the first character is '0', `cur` would be 0 (since it is even), and `mn` would remain 0.
- If the first character is '1', `cur` would be 1 (since it is odd, this case does not apply to the increase by 1 rule), and `mn` would still be 0.

In both cases, since `cur` cannot be less than `mn` (which is 0), the value of `mn` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, and `cur` is updated based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `cur` is updated based on the conditions provided.**
