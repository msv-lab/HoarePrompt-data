The code `cur = cur + 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` (which is initially `k - 1`) will be affected. Since the exact initial value of `cur` is not specified, we will represent it as `k - 1`. After executing the code, `cur` becomes `k`.

However, the conditions for updating `mn` and `mx` depend on the values of `cur % 2` and `c`. Since these conditions are not met in this simple increment operation, `mn` and `mx` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'` if `cur` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, otherwise `mn` and `mx` remain 0; `cur` is `k`**
