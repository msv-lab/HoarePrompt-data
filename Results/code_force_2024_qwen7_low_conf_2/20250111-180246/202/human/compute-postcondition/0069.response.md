The code updates the value of `mn` to be the minimum between its current value (`mn`) and the current value of `cur`. Given the initial state, the value of `mn` will be updated to the smaller of `mn` and `cur`.

Since `mn` is initially 0 and `cur` can either be 1 (if the condition is met) or -1 (if the condition is not met), the minimum value between `mn` and `cur` will be -1 if `cur` is -1, and 0 if `cur` is 1.

However, since `s` is a non-empty binary string, `cur` will eventually be updated based on the characters in `s`. Let's consider both scenarios:

1. If the first character in `s` is '1' and `cur` is even, or if the first character in `s` is '0' and `cur` is odd, then `cur` will be set to 1. In this case, `mn` remains 0.
2. If the first character in `s` is '0' and `cur` is even, or if the first character in `s` is '1' and `cur` is odd, then `cur` will be set to -1. In this case, `mn` is updated to -1.

Given that `s` is a non-empty binary string, let's assume the first character is '1' for the sake of determining the minimum. This means `cur` could be 1, and `mn` would remain 0.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 1.**
