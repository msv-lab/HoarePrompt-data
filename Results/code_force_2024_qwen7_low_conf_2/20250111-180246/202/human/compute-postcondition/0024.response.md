Postcondition: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`, and `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, or `cur + 1` or `0` if `(cur % 2 != 0) == (c == '1')`, where `c` is the third character of `s`.**
