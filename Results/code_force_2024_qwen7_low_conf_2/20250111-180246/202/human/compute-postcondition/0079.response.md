The code decrements the value of `cur` by 1. Given the initial state, `cur` is the next character in `s` if `prev_char` is '1' and the next character is '0', otherwise `cur` is the ASCII value of the next character in `s` minus 1. Since `cur` is a character or an integer, decrementing it by 1 changes its value.

- If `cur` was a character, it becomes the previous character in the ASCII sequence.
- If `cur` was an integer, it becomes `cur - 1`.

Since the exact value of `cur` isn't specified, we consider both cases:

- If `cur` was a character (e.g., 'a'), it would become 'z'.
- If `cur` was an integer (e.g., 97), it would become 96.

However, without the specific value of `cur`, we represent it generally as `cur - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is the maximum of 1 and `cur`, `cur` is `cur - 1`**
