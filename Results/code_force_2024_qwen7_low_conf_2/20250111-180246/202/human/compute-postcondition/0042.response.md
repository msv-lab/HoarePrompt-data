The code updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum between the current value of `mx` and `cur`. Since `mx` was initially set to 0, and `cur` is either 1 or -1 based on the condition, `mx` will be updated to the maximum value between 0 and `cur`.

Let's break down the logic:
- If `cur % 2 == 0` is equal to `c == '1'`, then `cur` is 1.
- Otherwise, `cur` is -1.

Since `mx` is initially 0, and `max(mx, cur)` will be `cur` if `cur` is greater than `mx` (which it will be since `cur` is either 1 or -1), `mx` will be updated to 1 if `cur` is 1, and remain 0 if `cur` is -1.

Therefore, the output state will be:
- `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, otherwise `mx` is 0.
- All other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect them directly.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur`; `mx` is 1 if `cur` is 1, otherwise 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined.**
