The code snippet updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of `mx` and `cur`. Given the initial state, `mx` remains unchanged because the value of `mx` is not affected by this operation. The value of `cur` may change based on the condition provided, but since no specific value for `cur` is given in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value after the operation. However, we know that `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mx` remains unchanged; `cur` is either `k` if `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')` or `k - 2` if `(cur % 2 == 0) != (c == '1')`. `mx` is updated to be the maximum of `mx` and `cur`.**
