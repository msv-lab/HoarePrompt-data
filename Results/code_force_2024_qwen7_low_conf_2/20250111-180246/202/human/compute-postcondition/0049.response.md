Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty.
   - `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, otherwise 0, and `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`.
   - `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`; otherwise, `mn` is 0 and `mx` is 0.
   - `cur` is decremented by 1.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for c in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - Since `s` is a binary string (each character is either '0' or '1'), the variable `c` will take on the values '0' or '1' during each iteration.

4. **Key Variables and Their Updates:**
   - `cur` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'`.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state of `cur` before the decrement.
   - Let's assume `cur` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration. After the loop body executes, `cur` will be `k - 1`.
   - `mn` and `mx` will be updated based on the condition `k % 2 == c == '1'`.

6. **Update the States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `cur` will be `k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `mn` and `mx` will be updated based on the condition `k % 2 == c == '1'`.

7. **Final Answer:**
   - Assuming `cur` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, `cur` will be `k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `mn` and `mx` will be updated based on the condition `k % 2 == c == '1'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` and `mx` are updated based on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'` if `cur` was `k` at the start of the previous iteration, otherwise `mn` and `mx` remain 0; `cur` is `k - 1`.**
