Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Variables and Their States:**
   - `mn`: The minimum value between 0 and `cur`.
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0.
   - `n`: An integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s`: A binary string of length `n`.
   - `mx`: The maximum of 0 and `cur`.
   - `cur`: Either `cur + 1` or -1.
   - `c`: The first character of `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Structure:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is the first character of `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be the second character of `s`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `mn` remains the same as it is based on the value of `cur` and is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `t` remains the same as it is an external variable and is not changed within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the length of the string `s` and does not change.
   - `mx` remains the same as it is based on the value of `cur` and is not affected by the loop itself.
   - `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1, but it does not directly affect the next character being processed.
   - `c` changes from the first character to the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mn` is the minimum value between 0 and `cur`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 1` or -1, `c` is the second character of `s`**.
