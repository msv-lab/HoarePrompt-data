Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length \(n - 1\) and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`, otherwise 0, and `mn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `cur`; `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`; otherwise, `mn` is 0 and `mx` is 0; `cur` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The code updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur + 1` if `cur % 2 == c == '1'`. Otherwise, `mn` and `mx` are set to 0.
- Since the initial values of `mn`, `mx`, and `cur` are not specified, the only change is in `mx`, which is updated based on the condition `cur % 2 == c == '1'`.
- `cur` is decremented by 1, but its new value is not specified without knowing the initial value.
