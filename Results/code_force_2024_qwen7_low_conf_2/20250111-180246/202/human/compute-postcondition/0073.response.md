`cur` is assigned the value of `cur - 1`. Since `cur` is the next character in the string `s`, and assuming `cur` is initially a character (e.g., 'a'), subtracting 1 from a character is not a valid operation in Python. Instead, it would attempt to interpret the character as an integer and subtract 1 from its ASCII value. For example, if `cur` was 'a', its ASCII value is 97, and `cur - 1` would result in 96, which corresponds to the character '``'.

Given the initial state where `cur` is the next character in the string `s`, and assuming `cur` is a single character, the updated value of `cur` after the operation would be the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `cur` - 1.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `s` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character remaining, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 1, `cur` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the original `cur` - 1**
