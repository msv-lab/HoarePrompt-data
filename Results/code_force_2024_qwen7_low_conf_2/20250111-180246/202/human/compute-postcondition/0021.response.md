Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions and the loop variable:**
   - `c` is the second character of `s`.
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s` is a binary string of length `n`.
   - `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`.
   - `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`.
   - `c` is the second character of `s`.

3. **Analyze the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For the loop to continue, `c` must be the next character in the string `s` after the second character.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `c` is the second character, the next character `c` should be the third character in the string `s`.
   - The other variables `mn`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mx`, and `cur` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop.

5. **Construct the updated state:**
   - `c` will be the third character of `s` (if it exists).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `c` is the third character of `s`.**
