The code snippet updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`. Let's analyze the impact on each variable:

- `mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`. It is not directly affected by the given code snippet.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0. It is not directly affected by the given code snippet.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). It is not directly affected by the given code snippet.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`. It is not directly affected by the given code snippet.
- `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `cur`. The code updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and `cur`.
- `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`. This means `cur` is updated based on the value of `c`, which is the second character of `s`.
- `c` is the second character of `s`.

Given the condition in the code, let's assume the values for `cur` and `c` (since they are not specified, we can consider the general case):

1. If `cur % 2 == 0` and `c == '1'`, then `cur` becomes `cur + 2`.
2. If `cur % 2 != 0` and `c == '0'`, then `cur` becomes `cur + 2`.
3. In any other case, `cur` becomes `0`.

In all cases, `mx` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the new value of `cur`.

Output State: **`mn` is the minimum value between its current value and `cur` or `0`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and the new value of `cur`, `cur` is either `cur + 2` or `0` depending on the condition `(cur % 2 == 0) == (c == '1')`, and `c` is the second character of `s`.**
