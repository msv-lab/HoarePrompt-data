The code `print(mx - mn)` simply prints the difference between `mx` (the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations) and `mn` (the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations). However, no new assignments or operations are performed in this line, so the values of `mx`, `mn`, and `cur` remain unchanged from their previous states. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cur` are also not affected.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length 0 and must be empty; `mn` is the minimum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop; `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `cur` is 0.**
