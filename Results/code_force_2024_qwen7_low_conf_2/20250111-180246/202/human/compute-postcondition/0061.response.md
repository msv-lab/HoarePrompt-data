The code sets `mx` to 0. This does not change the value of `mx` which was already defined as the maximum value of `cur` over all iterations of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t < 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `s` is a binary string of the user input, `mn` is 0, `mx` is 0, the value printed is `mx - mn`, `cur` is 0.**
