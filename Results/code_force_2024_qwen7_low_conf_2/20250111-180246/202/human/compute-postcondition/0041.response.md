The code updates the value of `mn` to be the minimum between its current value (`mn`) and the current value of `cur`. Given the initial conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty.
- `mn` is 0.
- `mx` is 0.
- The value printed is `mx - mn`.
- `s` is now defined.
- If `cur % 2 == 0` is equal to `c == '1'`, then `cur` is 1; otherwise, `cur` is -1.

The code snippet sets `mn` to the minimum of its current value and `cur`. Since the initial value of `mn` is 0, `mn` will only change if `cur` is less than 0 (since `cur` is either 1 or -1 based on the condition).

Therefore, after executing the line `mn = min(mn, cur)`, the value of `mn` will be updated to be the minimum of 0 and `cur`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and must be greater than 1; `n` is an integer obtained from input such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` and must not be empty; `mn` is the minimum of 0 and `cur`; `mx` is 0; the value printed is `mx - mn`; `s` is now defined. If `cur % 2 == 0` is equal to `c == '1'`, then `cur` is 1; otherwise, `cur` is -1.**
