t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the length of the binary string s, and a string s of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
