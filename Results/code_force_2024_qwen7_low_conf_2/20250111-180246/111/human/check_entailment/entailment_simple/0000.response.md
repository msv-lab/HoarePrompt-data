Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to count the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings (each containing exactly one '1') and no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - The constraints are respected: `1 ≤ t ≤ 2500`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2500`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The `dp` table is initialized to store intermediate results for subproblems. 
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` with exactly `j` good substrings of length up to `k`.
   - The base case `dp[1][1] = 1` initializes the table correctly for the smallest possible string with a single '1'.
   - The dynamic programming transitions ensure that each state builds upon previously computed states, maintaining the constraints of having exactly `j` good substrings of length up to `k`.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - The final result is calculated as the sum of `dp[i][n]` for `i` from `2` to `k+1`, modulo `998244353`. This ensures that the program handles the required counting and modular arithmetic correctly.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - All operations are performed under modulo `998244353`, ensuring that the results remain within manageable bounds and meet the problem's requirement for large inputs.

Given the above points, the program accurately implements the solution to the problem described. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
