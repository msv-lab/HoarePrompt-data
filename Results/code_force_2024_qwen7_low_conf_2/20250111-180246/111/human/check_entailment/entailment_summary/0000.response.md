Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The `dp` table is initialized with dimensions `(k + 1) x (n + 1)` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form `j` good substrings using the first `i` characters. This is a valid way to approach the problem since we need to count the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

2. **Base Case**: `dp[1][1]` is set to 1, indicating there's one way to have a single '1' at the start (a good substring of length 1).

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: For each character position `i` from 2 to `k` and for each possible number of good substrings `j` from 1 to `n`, the value `dp[i][j]` is calculated. This is done by considering whether the current character (at position `i`) forms part of a good substring:
   - If the current character does not contribute to a new good substring (`dp[i-1][j]`), or
   - If the current character contributes to forming a new good substring (`dp[i-1][j-1]`).

4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is obtained by summing up the values of `dp[i][n]` for all valid lengths `i` from 2 to `k` (since we want good substrings of length up to `k`), and taking the result modulo `998244353`.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The use of `MOD` ensures that the result fits within the required constraints, preventing overflow.

Given the execution summary and the detailed explanation above, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
