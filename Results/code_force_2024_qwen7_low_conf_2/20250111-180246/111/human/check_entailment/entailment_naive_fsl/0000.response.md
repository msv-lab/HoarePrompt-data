Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. 

To illustrate the issue, consider the test case `(n=4, k=2)`:

- The program should return the number of binary strings of length up to 4 (since `n=4` and `k=2`) that have exactly 4 good substrings and no good substring longer than 2. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario.

The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to build solutions, but the way it calculates the `dp` table is flawed. Specifically, the line:
```python
dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
```
is incorrect for this problem. This line suggests that adding a '0' or a '1' to a string does not necessarily maintain the constraint of having exactly `n` good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

A correct approach would involve generating all possible binary strings and checking if they meet the criteria, rather than using dynamic programming in this manner. The current implementation does not ensure that the generated strings have exactly `n` good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.

Therefore, the program does not work as expected for the given problem description.
