### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to count the number of binary strings of length up to some value such that the string contains exactly `n` good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. A good substring is defined as a substring containing exactly one '1'.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` is supposed to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. It constructs a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a string of length `i` with exactly `j` good substrings. The function then sums these values for lengths from 2 to `k+1`.

#### Correctness of the Program:
1. **Initialization**: 
   ```python
   dp[1][1] = 1
   ```
   This initializes the base case where a single '1' forms one good substring.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Update**:
   ```python
   for i in range(2, k + 1):
       for j in range(1, n + 1):
           dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
   ```
   This loop updates the `dp` table. Here, `dp[i][j]` is updated by considering:
   - Appending a '0' to a string of length `i-1` that has `j` good substrings.
   - Appending a '1' to a string of length `i-1` that has `j-1` good substrings.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   ```python
   result = sum((dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k + 1))) % MOD
   ```
   This sums the number of ways to form strings of lengths from 2 to `k+1` with exactly `n` good substrings.

This approach ensures that the constraints are met: exactly `n` good substrings and no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. The dynamic programming table correctly accounts for the transitions between string lengths and the number of good substrings.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the solution, the provided program is indeed correct. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program does not work as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to count the number of binary strings that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`.
