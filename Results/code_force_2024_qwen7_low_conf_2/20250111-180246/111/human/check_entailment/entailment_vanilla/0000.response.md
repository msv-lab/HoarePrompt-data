Reasoning:

The program aims to count the number of binary strings `s` that contain exactly `n` good substrings and have no good substring of length strictly greater than `k`. To achieve this, the program uses dynamic programming (DP).

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the number of binary strings of length `i` that contain exactly `j` good substrings.
   - `dp[1][1] = 1` because a string of length 1 containing exactly 1 good substring can only be "1".

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each length `i` from 2 to `k`, and for each number of good substrings `j` from 1 to `n`:
     - If we append '0' to a string of length `i-1`, it won't change the number of good substrings, so `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]`.
     - If we append '1', the number of good substrings will increase by 1 if the last character was '0', so `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]`.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - Sum up `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k` to get the total number of binary strings of any length up to `k` that contain exactly `n` good substrings.

This approach seems to correctly model the problem. However, there are a few points to verify:

1. The function `func_1` is defined to handle the DP calculation.
2. The modulo operation (`% MOD`) is applied correctly throughout the computation to avoid overflow.
3. The summing step at the end is also correctly applied to accumulate the results.

Given the structure and logic, the program appears to be implementing the correct algorithm. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
