### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the dynamic programming (DP) solution. Let's review the logic and ensure its correctness:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The initialization `dp[1][1] = 1` is correct because a string of length 1 containing exactly one good substring must be "1". All other entries in the first row (where `j=1`) are set to 0, as they cannot form a good substring.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each length `i` from 2 to `k`, and for each number of good substrings `j` from 1 to `n`:
     - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j]`: This transition is correct because appending a '0' to a string of length `i-1` does not create a new good substring, and thus the number of good substrings remains the same.
     - `dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-1]`: This transition is also correct because appending a '1' to a string of length `i-1` that ends with '0' creates a new good substring. Hence, the number of good substrings increases by 1.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The final result is obtained by summing `dp[i][n]` for all `i` from 1 to `k`, which correctly counts the number of binary strings of any length up to `k` that contain exactly `n` good substrings.

The code correctly implements these steps, and the use of modulo `MOD` ensures that intermediate results do not overflow. The annotated code confirms that the logic matches the explanation provided in the original assessment.

Given the structure and the logical correctness of the implementation, the program is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given constraints.
