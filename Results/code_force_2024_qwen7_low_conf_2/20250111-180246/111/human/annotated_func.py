#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2500 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and n is the number of required good substrings and k is the maximum allowed length of a good substring.
def func_1(n, k):
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(k + 1)]
    dp[1][1] = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`, where `dp[1][1] = 1`, `dp[i][1] = 0` for all `i` from `2` to `k+1`, `dp[1][j] = 0` for all `j` from `2` to `n+1`, and `dp[i][j]` for all `i` from `2` to `k+1` and `j` from `2` to `n+1` equals the sum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]` modulo `MOD`, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `2`, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `1`, and `MOD` is a constant value.
    result = sum(dp[i][n] for i in range(1, k + 1)) % MOD
    return result
    #The program returns result which is the sum of dp[i][n] for i from 2 to k+1 modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2500\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of good substrings of length `j` using the first `i` characters of a string. The function calculates the sum of `dp[i][n]` for `i` ranging from 2 to `k+1` and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified ranges and computes the result as described, without any missing or redundant logic.
