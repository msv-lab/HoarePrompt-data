The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2500\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of good substrings of length `j` using the first `i` characters of a string. The function calculates the sum of `dp[i][n]` for `i` ranging from 2 to `k+1` and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. The function handles all valid inputs within the specified ranges and computes the result as described, without any missing or redundant logic.
