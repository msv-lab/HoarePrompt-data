State before the loop starts: `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The for loop `for j in range(1, n + 1):` will execute as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Initial Value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j = 1`.

3. **Range of `j`**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given this, we need to ensure that the initial value of `j` is 1 and that the loop can proceed until `j` reaches `n + 1`. Since the loop starts with `j = 1`, it will execute for the range from 1 to `n + 1` if `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Since the state before the loop already specifies that `j` should start at 1 and the loop will continue as long as `j` is within the specified range, no adjustments to the given states are necessary for the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the states remain as provided.

**State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is 1, `i` is `k + 2`, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.**
