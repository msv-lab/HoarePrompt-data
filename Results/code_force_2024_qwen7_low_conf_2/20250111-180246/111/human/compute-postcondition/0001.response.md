The code initializes `dp[1][1]` to 1. This changes the value of one element in the 2D list `dp`. The dimensions of `dp` remain `(k+1) x (n+1)`, and all elements except `dp[1][1]` are still 0.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is 1.**
