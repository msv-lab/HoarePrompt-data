Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is 1, and `dp[i][j]` is computed based on the previous row (`dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]`), `i` is `k+1`, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized as a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` with all elements set to 0.
   - `dp[1][1]` is set to 1.
   - `i` starts at 2 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `k+1`.
   - `k` must be at least 2.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each `j` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each `j`, `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `k+1` because the loop increments `i` starting from 2 up to `k+1`.
   - Each element `dp[i][j]` will be computed based on the previous row's values, following the binomial coefficient pattern, since the update rule resembles Pascal's triangle.
   - Specifically, `dp[i][j]` will be the binomial coefficient `C(i-1, j-1)` for `i >= 2` and `j >= 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the loop does not execute (e.g., `n` is 0), then `dp` remains initialized with all zeros, except for `dp[1][1]` which is 1.
   - If `k` is less than 2, the loop would not run because `i` would start at 2 and `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to initialize properly.

Thus, the final state of the `dp` matrix will reflect the binomial coefficients for `i` from 1 to `k+1` and `j` from 1 to `n`.
