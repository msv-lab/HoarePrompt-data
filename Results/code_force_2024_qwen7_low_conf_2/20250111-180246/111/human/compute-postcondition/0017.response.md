Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`; `i` is `k + 2`; `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `2`; `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `1`; for all `i` from `1` to `k+1` and `j` from `1` to `n+1`, `dp[i][j]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j-1]) % MOD`.**
