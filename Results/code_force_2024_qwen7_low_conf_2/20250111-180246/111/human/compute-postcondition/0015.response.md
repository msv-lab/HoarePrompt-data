According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`, and `dp[k + 2][1]` is `1`; `i` is `k + 2`; `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2; `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `1`.

Since `j` starts at `1` and the loop iterates until `j < n + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `dp` remains the same.
- `i` remains `k + 2`.
- `k` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` is increased by 1, so it becomes `2`.

State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`, and `dp[k + 2][1]` is `1`; `i` is `k + 2`; `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2; `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `2`**.
