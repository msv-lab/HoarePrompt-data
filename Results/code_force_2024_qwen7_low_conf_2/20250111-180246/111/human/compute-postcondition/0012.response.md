Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is 1; `i` is `k + 2`; `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2; `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1; `dp[i][j]` for all `j` from 1 to `n+1` is updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`.**
