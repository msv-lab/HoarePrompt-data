The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2500 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of `dp[i][n]` for `i` ranging from 2 to `k+1` modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the sum of `dp[i][n]` for `i` from 2 to `k+1` modulo `MOD`.
