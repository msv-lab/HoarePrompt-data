Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)`, where `dp[1][1] = 1`, `dp[i][1] = 0` for all `i` from `2` to `k+1`, `dp[1][j] = 0` for all `j` from `2` to `n+1`, and `dp[i][j]` for all `i` from `2` to `k+1` and `j` from `2` to `n+1` equals the sum of `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i-1][j-1]` modulo `MOD`, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `2`, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `1`, and `MOD` is a constant value.**
