Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`.
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `2`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `1`.

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop will start from `j = 1` and continue until `j = n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will only execute if `n` is at least `1`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` meets this condition.
   - The value of `i` (`i` is `2`) does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - The `dp` table and `k` do not need to be explicitly adjusted because they do not influence whether the loop starts.

Given these considerations, the necessary adjustments to the initial state for the loop to execute are as follows:

**State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`, `i` is `2`, `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`**.
