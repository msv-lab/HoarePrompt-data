The initial state is defined such that `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is 0, except `dp[1][1]` which is 1; `i` is `k + 2`; `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2; `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `1`.

The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` using the formula `dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - 1]) % MOD`. Since `i` is `k + 2` and `j` is `1`, the formula becomes `dp[k + 2][1] = (dp[k + 1][1] + dp[k + 1][0]) % MOD`.

Given the initial state, `dp[k + 1][1]` is `1` and `dp[k + 1][0]` is `0` because every element in `dp` is initialized to `0` except `dp[1][1]`. Therefore, the calculation simplifies to:

\[ dp[k + 2][1] = (1 + 0) \% MOD = 1 \]

The other elements remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state includes:
- `dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`, and `dp[k + 2][1]` is `1`.
- `i` is now `k + 2`.
- `k` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `j` remains `1`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of dimensions `(k+1) x (n+1)` where each element is `0`, except `dp[1][1]` which is `1`, and `dp[k + 2][1]` is `1`; `i` is `k + 2`; `k` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2; `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 1; `j` is `1`.**
