The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `edges`, which is a list of tuples where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge connecting vertices u and v. The constraints for `n` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10³. Each vertex is numbered from 1 to n, and no vertex is connected to itself or has more than one edge connecting it to another vertex.

After executing the function body, the function returns the length of the operations list and the list itself. Each tuple in the list has the form (nodes_at_d[0], d) for each distance d from 0 to max_distance, and nodes_at_d is non-empty.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of edges, and return the length of the operations list and the list itself, where each tuple in the list specifies a node and its distance from a certain point.
