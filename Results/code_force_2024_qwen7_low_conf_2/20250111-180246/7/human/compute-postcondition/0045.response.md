The code updates the value of `distances[neighbor]` to `current_distance + 1`. It also adds the `neighbor` to the `queue` since it is not already in `distances`. Given these changes, the updated values are as follows:

- `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.
- `queue` contains the value of `neighbor`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains the value of `neighbor`, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`.**
