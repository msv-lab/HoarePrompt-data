Postcondition: ***`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, and is an empty list otherwise.***

Explanation: Since the else part is empty, the postcondition of the if part directly serves as the overall postcondition of the if-else block. The conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged based on the if part's postcondition.
