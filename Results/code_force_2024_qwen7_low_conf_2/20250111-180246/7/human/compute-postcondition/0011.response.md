The function `func_1(tree, 1)` is called with `tree` and the starting vertex `1`. This function likely calculates the distances from the starting vertex to all other vertices in the tree. However, since the function itself is not defined, we cannot specify the exact distances without more information. The only thing we know for certain is that `distances` will be a list where the index corresponds to the vertex and the value at that index will be the distance from vertex `1` to that vertex.

Given this, the output state is:

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree.**
