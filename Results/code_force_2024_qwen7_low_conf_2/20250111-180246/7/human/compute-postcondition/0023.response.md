Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `edges` is an empty list.
   - `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges.
   - `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree.
   - `max_distance` must be non-negative.
   - `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, and is an empty list otherwise.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   ```python
   for d in range(max_distance + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `d` from `0` to `max_distance`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be less than `max_distance + 1`.

4. **Current Value of `d`:**
   - Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, letâ€™s denote the current value of `d` as `d_current`.

5. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `d_current` must be less than `max_distance + 1`.
   - Therefore, `d_current` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `edges` remains unchanged as the loop body is not specified, and no operations are mentioned that would change this list.
   - `tree` remains unchanged as it is built during the execution of the loop body, and no operations are mentioned that would change this dictionary.
   - `distances` remains unchanged as it is built during the execution of the loop body, and no operations are mentioned that would change this list.
   - `max_distance` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined before the loop.
   - `operations` will be updated based on the value of `nodes_at_d` for the new value of `d`.

7. **New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The new value of `d` will be `d_current + 1`.
   - If `nodes_at_d[d_current + 1]` is not empty, then the next element in the `operations` list will be `(nodes_at_d[d_current + 1][0], d_current + 2)`.
   - Otherwise, `operations` will remain unchanged as an empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[d_current + 1][0], d_current + 2)` if `nodes_at_d[d_current + 1]` is not empty, and is an empty list otherwise.**

Where `d_current` is the value of `d` at the end of the previous iteration.
