The code initializes a dictionary called `tree` where each key is a vertex number from 1 to `n` and the corresponding value is an empty list. This dictionary will be used to represent the tree structure, where each key points to a list of adjacent vertices.

After executing the given code snippet, the `tree` dictionary is updated with empty lists for each vertex from 1 to `n`. The values of `n` and `edges` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`tree` is a dictionary where each key is a vertex number from 1 to `n` and the corresponding value is an empty list; `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree; `edges` is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge connecting vertices u and v in the tree.**
