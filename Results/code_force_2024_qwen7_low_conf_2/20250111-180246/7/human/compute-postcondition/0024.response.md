The code creates a list `nodes_at_d` which contains nodes whose distance from vertex 1 is equal to `d`. This does not directly change any existing variables but rather creates a new list based on the values of `distances`. No specific values of `d` are provided, so we will keep it general.

Given the initial state:
- `edges` is an empty list
- `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges
- `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree
- `max_distance` must be non-negative
- `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[d_current + 1][0], d_current + 2)` if `nodes_at_d[d_current + 1]` is not empty, and is an empty list otherwise

After executing the code:
- A new list `nodes_at_d` is created based on the distances in the `distances` list.

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[d_current + 1][0], d_current + 2)` if `nodes_at_d[d_current + 1]` is not empty, and is an empty list otherwise; `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes whose distance from vertex 1 is equal to `d`.**
