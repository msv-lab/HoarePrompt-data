Output State: **`queue` is empty, `distances` contains the shortest path distances from the initial node to all reachable nodes, `current_distance` is equal to the value of `distances[node]` when the loop terminated, and `node` is the last node processed in the final iteration of the loop.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `queue` is not empty initially, but it may become empty as nodes are processed.
   - `distances` dictionary holds the shortest path distances from the initial node to each reachable node.
   - `current_distance` is the shortest path distance to the current node (`node`).
   - `node` is the current node being processed.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over all neighbors of the current node (`node`).
   - For each neighbor, if it is not already in `distances`, it updates the shortest path distance to this neighbor and adds it to the `queue`.
   - This process continues until there are no more nodes to process.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - Once the `queue` becomes empty, it means all reachable nodes have been processed.
   - `distances` will contain the shortest path distances from the initial node to all reachable nodes.
   - `current_distance` will hold the distance to the last node processed.
   - `node` will be the last node processed, which could be any node in the tree, depending on the structure and processing order.

Thus, the loop terminates when all nodes have been processed, ensuring that `distances` contains the correct shortest path distances and `queue` is empty.
