The code updates the `distances` dictionary by setting `distances[neighbor]` to `current_distance + 1`. This means the distance to the `neighbor` from the current node is set to the current distance plus one. The `current_distance` remains unchanged, and the `node` variable is not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `queue` contains all its previous elements, plus `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `queue`; `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`; `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`; and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.

Output State: **`queue` contains all its previous elements, plus `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `queue`; `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`; `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`; and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.**
