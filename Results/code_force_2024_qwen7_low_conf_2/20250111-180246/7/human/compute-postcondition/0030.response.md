Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge connecting vertices `u` and `v`. It constructs a tree representation and calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices. Then, it identifies nodes at each distance level and creates a list of tuples indicating the first node at each distance level along with the distance. Finally, it returns the length of this list and the list itself. The returned list contains tuples of the form `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` for each distance `d` from 0 to the maximum distance, ensuring that `nodes_at_d` is non-empty.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that `n` is within the valid range `[1, 2 * 10^3]`. If `n` is outside this range, the function should handle such cases appropriately.
- The function constructs the tree and calculates distances correctly, but it does not handle cases where the input `edges` might be empty or invalid (e.g., self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices).
- While the function constructs the tree and calculates distances, it does not validate the input `edges` to ensure they do not contain self-loops or duplicate edges, which could lead to incorrect tree construction.
- The function assumes that the distances are correctly calculated and that the `distances` dictionary will always have non-empty values for each node, but this should be validated within the function to ensure correctness.
- The function does not account for the case where all nodes are at the same distance from vertex 1, which would result in a list of tuples with only one node at each distance level, but this is handled by the postconditions.
