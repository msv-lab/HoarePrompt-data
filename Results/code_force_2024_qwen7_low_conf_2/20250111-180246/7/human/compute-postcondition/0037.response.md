`node` is assigned the value of the first element of the queue using the `popleft()` method, which removes and returns the leftmost element of the queue. The other variables (`queue`, `distances`, and `current_distance`) remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain the node that was just removed, `distances` remains unchanged, `current_distance` remains unchanged, and `node` is equal to the value of the first element of the queue before it was removed.**
