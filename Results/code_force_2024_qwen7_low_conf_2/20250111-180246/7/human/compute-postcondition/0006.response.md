The code `tree[v].append(u)` modifies the list `tree[v]` by appending the value `u` to it. In the initial state, `v` is the first element in each sublist of `tree`, which corresponds to the first element in each tuple of `edges`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- For the first tuple `(0, 1)` in `edges`, `v` is `0` and `u` is `1`. So, `tree[0].append(1)`.
- For the second tuple `(1, 2)` in `edges`, `v` is `1` and `u` is `2`. So, `tree[1].append(2)`.
- For the third tuple `(2, 3)` in `edges`, `v` is `2` and `u` is `3`. So, `tree[2].append(3)`.

After applying these operations, the updated `tree` is:
- `tree[0]` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1]` (original `[1, 1, 1]` with `1` appended).
- `tree[1]` becomes `[2, 2, 2]` (original `[2, 2]` with `2` appended).
- `tree[2]` becomes `[3, 3, 3, 3]` (original `[3, 3]` with `3` appended).

Output State: **`edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]`, `tree` is `[[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3]]`**
