Postcondition: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is an empty list, `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`. The current value of `nodes_at_d` is not empty.**
