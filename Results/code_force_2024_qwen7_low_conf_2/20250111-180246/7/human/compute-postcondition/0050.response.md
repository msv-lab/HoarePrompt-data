The code snippet `queue.append(neighbor)` appends the `neighbor` to the `queue`. The variable `queue` was previously containing the value of `next_neighbor`, and now it also contains the `neighbor`.

The initial conditions state that `tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and if `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`, then `distances[next_neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains the value of `next_neighbor`, and the current value of `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`; additionally, `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.

Since the `queue.append(neighbor)` operation only adds `neighbor` to `queue`, the conditions regarding `next_neighbor` and `distances` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor.
- If `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`, then `distances[next_neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains the value of `next_neighbor`, and the current value of `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`.
- `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.
- `queue` now includes both `next_neighbor` and `neighbor`.

Output State: **`tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, if `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`, then `distances[next_neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains the value of `next_neighbor`, and the current value of `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`; additionally, `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains both `next_neighbor` and `neighbor`.**
