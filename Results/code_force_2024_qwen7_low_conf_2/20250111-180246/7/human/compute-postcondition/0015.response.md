The code creates a list `nodes_at_d` which contains nodes from the `distances` list where the distance `dist` is equal to `d`. However, the value of `d` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact nodes in `nodes_at_d`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is an empty list, `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`.**
