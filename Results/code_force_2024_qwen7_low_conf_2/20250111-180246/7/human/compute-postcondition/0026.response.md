Postcondition: ***`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` is non-negative, `operations` is a list containing an additional tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` if `nodes_at_d` is non-empty, or `([], d)` if `nodes_at_d` is empty, and `nodes_at_d` remains unchanged.***
