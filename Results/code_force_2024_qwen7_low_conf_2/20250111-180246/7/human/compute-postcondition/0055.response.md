The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tree` and `start_node`. 

- `tree` is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.
- `start_node` is an integer representing the starting node for breadth-first search, such that `1 <= start_node <= n`, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree.

The function returns a dictionary `distances` which contains the shortest distance from the starting node to all nodes that are reachable in the tree.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `tree` and an integer `start_node`. It returns a dictionary `distances` containing the shortest distance from `start_node` to all reachable nodes in the tree.**
