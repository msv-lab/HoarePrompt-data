Postcondition: ***`queue` contains all its previous elements, and if `neighbor` was not already in `queue`, it is added to `queue`. `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`. `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`, and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.***
