The code snippet `max_distance = max(distances.values())` finds the maximum value in the `distances` list and assigns it to `max_distance`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for the `distances` list, we only know that `max_distance` is now set to the maximum distance from vertex 1 to any other vertex in the tree.

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` is the maximum value in `distances`, `operations` is an empty list.**
