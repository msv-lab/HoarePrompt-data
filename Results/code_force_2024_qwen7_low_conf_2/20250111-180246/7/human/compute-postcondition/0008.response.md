The code `tree[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree[u]`. However, the values of `u` and `v` are not specified in the initial state. Since these values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact changes to the `tree` list. But we can state that the value of `u` and `v` will be appended to `tree[u]`.

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is `[[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3]], the value of `tree[u]` is updated by appending `v` to it.**
