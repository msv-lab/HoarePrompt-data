`queue` is a list where elements are appended using the `append` method. The code appends the value of `neighbor` to `queue`. Since `queue` was not initially defined, we assume it is being created here. The current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`, so appending it to `queue` does not affect the `distances` dictionary. 

Output State: **`tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains the value of `neighbor`, the current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`**
