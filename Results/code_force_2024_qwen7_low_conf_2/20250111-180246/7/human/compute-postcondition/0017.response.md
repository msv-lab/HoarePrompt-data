The code appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the list `operations`. This means that the first element of the list `nodes_at_d` (which is a node from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`) is paired with the value `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges.
- `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree.
- `max_distance` must be non-negative.
- `operations` is an empty list.
- `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`.

After the code execution, the following changes occur:
- `operations` is updated to include the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`, `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`.**
