Output State: **`queue` does not contain any unvisited neighbors of the nodes currently in the queue, `distances` contains the shortest distance from the starting node to all visited nodes, and `current_distance` is the maximum distance found among the visited nodes.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: 
   - `queue` does not contain the node that was just removed.
   - `distances` remains unchanged.
   - `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`.
   - `node` is equal to the value of the first element of the queue before it was removed.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each neighbor of the current node.
   - If a neighbor is not in `distances`, it sets the distance to `current_distance + 1` and adds the neighbor to the queue.
   - This process continues until all reachable nodes from the starting node have been processed.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - Once all reachable nodes have been processed, the `queue` will no longer contain any unvisited neighbors of the nodes currently in the queue. This means all neighbors of the nodes in the queue have either been added to the `queue` or have already been visited.
   - The `distances` dictionary will contain the shortest distance from the starting node to all visited nodes.
   - `current_distance` will be the maximum distance found among the visited nodes because it keeps track of the distance as the loop progresses.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the loop does not execute (i.e., the `queue` is empty), then `queue` will be empty, and `distances` will only contain the distances for the starting node (if it was added). `current_distance` will still be the distance of the starting node since it is initialized to `distances[node]`.

This ensures that all reachable nodes have been visited and their distances calculated, providing the final state of the program after all iterations of the loop have finished.
