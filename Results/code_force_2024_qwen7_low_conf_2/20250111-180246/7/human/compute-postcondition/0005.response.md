The code `tree[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree[u]`. Here, `u` and `v` are elements from the `edges` list, which means `u` is the first element and `v` is the second element of each tuple in `edges`.

Given the initial state:
- `edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]`
- `tree` is `[[1, 1], [2], [3]]`

For each tuple in `edges`:
1. For the first tuple `(0, 1)`: `u = 0` and `v = 1`. Since `u` is 0, `tree[u]` is `tree[0]` which is `[1, 1]`. Appending `v` (which is 1) to `tree[0]` results in `[1, 1, 1]`.
2. For the second tuple `(1, 2)`: `u = 1` and `v = 2`. Since `u` is 1, `tree[u]` is `tree[1]` which is `[2]`. Appending `v` (which is 2) to `tree[1]` results in `[2, 2]`.
3. For the third tuple `(2, 3)`: `u = 2` and `v = 3`. Since `u` is 2, `tree[u]` is `tree[2]` which is `[3]`. Appending `v` (which is 3) to `tree[2]` results in `[3, 3]`.

After processing all tuples in `edges`, the updated state of `tree` is:
- `tree[0]` is `[1, 1, 1]`
- `tree[1]` is `[2, 2]`
- `tree[2]` is `[3, 3]`

Output State: **`edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]`, `tree` is `[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3]]`**
