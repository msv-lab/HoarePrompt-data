Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `queue` does not contain the node that was just removed.
   - `distances` remains unchanged.
   - `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`.
   - `node` is equal to the value of the first element of the queue before it was removed.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each `neighbor` in `tree[node]`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one neighbor in `tree[node]`. If `tree[node]` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop depends on the existence of neighbors in `tree[node]`, we need to ensure that `tree[node]` contains at least one neighbor.
   - The other provided states (`queue`, `distances`, `current_distance`, and `node`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they describe the initial state from which the loop begins.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor**
