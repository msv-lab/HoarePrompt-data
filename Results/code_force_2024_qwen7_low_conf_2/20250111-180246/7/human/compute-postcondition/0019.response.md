Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges.
- `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree.
- `max_distance` must be non-negative.
- `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, and `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` remains an empty list.

### For Loop
```python
for d in range(max_distance + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs from `d = 0` to `d = max_distance`.
2. **Loop Body**: The body of the loop is not specified, but it likely involves some operations related to the current value of `d`.

### Adjusting States
To determine the states at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

- The loop variable `d` increases by 1 with each iteration.
- `max_distance` does not change during the loop execution.
- The states of `edges`, `tree`, `distances`, `operations`, and `nodes_at_d` might change based on the loop body, but they are not specified.

Given that the only thing changing explicitly is the value of `d`, we update `d` to `d + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

### Updated States
- `d` will be incremented by 1.
- `nodes_at_d` will be updated according to the new value of `d`.

### Updated State
State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, and `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d + 1` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` remains an empty list.**

Thus, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, and `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d + 1` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` remains an empty list.**
