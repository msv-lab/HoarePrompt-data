`queue` appends the value of `neighbor` to itself. The condition that `neighbor` is not already in `queue` is not checked explicitly in this line of code, but it will only add `neighbor` if it is not already present. The value of `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `current_distance` remains unchanged, and `node` is updated to the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`. Therefore, the output state is: `queue` contains all its previous elements plus `neighbor` (if `neighbor` was not already in `queue`); `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`; `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`; and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.
