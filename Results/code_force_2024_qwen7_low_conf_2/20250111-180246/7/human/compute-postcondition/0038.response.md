`current_distance` is assigned the value of `distances[node]`. The value of `current_distance` is now equal to the value in the `distances` dictionary corresponding to the key `node`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`queue` does not contain the node that was just removed, `distances` remains unchanged, `current_distance` is equal to `distances[node]`, and `node` is equal to the value of the first element of the queue before it was removed.**
