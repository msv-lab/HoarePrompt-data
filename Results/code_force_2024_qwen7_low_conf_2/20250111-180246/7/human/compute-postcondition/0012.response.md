The code initializes an empty list called `operations`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`edges`, `tree`, and `distances`). Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree; `operations` is an empty list.**
