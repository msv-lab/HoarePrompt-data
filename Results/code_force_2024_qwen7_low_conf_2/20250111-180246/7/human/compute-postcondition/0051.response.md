Postcondition: ***`tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor. If `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`, then `distances[next_neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, `queue` contains the value of `next_neighbor`, and the current value of `next_neighbor` is not in `distances`. Additionally, `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`, and `queue` contains both `next_neighbor` and `neighbor`.***
