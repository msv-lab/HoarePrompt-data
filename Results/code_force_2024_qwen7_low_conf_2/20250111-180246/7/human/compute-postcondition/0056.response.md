Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `tree` representing a tree structure where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes, along with an integer `start_node` indicating the starting node for a breadth-first search (BFS). The function performs a BFS traversal to calculate the shortest distance from the `start_node` to all other nodes that are reachable within the tree. After completing the BFS, the function returns a dictionary `distances` where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is the shortest distance from the `start_node` to that node.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the `start_node` does not exist in the tree, the function will still attempt to initialize distances for it, but since it won't be reachable from itself, the distance will remain `0`.
- If the tree is disconnected and the `start_node` is not connected to any other node, the returned dictionary will only contain the `start_node` with a distance of `0`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotated code correctly describes the functionality of the function. There is no missing functionality in the code provided.
