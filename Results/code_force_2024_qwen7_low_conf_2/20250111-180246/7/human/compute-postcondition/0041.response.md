`distances[neighbor]` is assigned the value of `current_distance + 1`. The value of `current_distance` is known from the initial state, and `neighbor` is a specific neighbor of `node`. The initial state also mentions that `tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, and the current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`. After executing the code, `distances[neighbor]` will be updated to `current_distance + 1`.

Output State: **`tree[node]` must contain at least one neighbor, `distances[neighbor]` is `current_distance + 1`, the current value of `neighbor` is not in `distances`**
