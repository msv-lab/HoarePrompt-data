The code `nodes_at_d = [node for node, dist in distances.items() if dist == d]` creates a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d`. 

Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. `edges` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
2. `tree` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
3. `distances` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
4. `max_distance` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it.
5. `operations` may change depending on the value of `nodes_at_d`.

The list comprehension creates `nodes_at_d` based on the current `distances` dictionary. If there are nodes in `distances` whose distance is exactly `d`, `nodes_at_d` will contain those nodes. Otherwise, it will be an empty list.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values in `distances`, we can only say that `nodes_at_d` will contain the nodes from `distances` whose distance is equal to `d`, or it will be an empty list if no such nodes exist.

Output State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d + 1)` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty, and `nodes_at_d` is a list of nodes from the `distances` dictionary where the distance is equal to `d + 1` if `nodes_at_d` is not empty. If `nodes_at_d` is empty, `operations` remains an empty list. `nodes_at_d` contains the nodes from `distances` whose distance is equal to `d`.**
