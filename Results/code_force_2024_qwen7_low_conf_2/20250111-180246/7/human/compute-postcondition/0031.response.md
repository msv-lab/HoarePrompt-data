Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the initial state**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
   - `queue` contains all its previous elements, plus `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `queue`.
   - `distances` is updated such that the shortest path distance to `neighbor` is `distances[current_node] + 1`.
   - `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`.
   - `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.
   - If `neighbor` is not in `distances`, `distances[neighbor]` is set to `current_distance + 1`.
   - If `neighbor` is already in `distances`, no changes are made to `distances`.

2. **Understand the loop structure**: The loop iterates over `neighbor` in `tree[node]`.

3. **Determine the next iteration conditions**:
   - For the loop to continue, the next `neighbor` must be a valid element in `tree[node]`.
   - The state at the end of the current iteration should reflect that `node` was processed and `neighbor` was considered.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `node` should be updated to the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]` (if there is one).
   - `current_distance` should remain the same unless `neighbor` is added to `distances` with an updated value.
   - The `queue` might change depending on whether `neighbor` was added to it.

Given the above points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `node` should be the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.
- `current_distance` remains the same.
- `queue` will contain all its previous elements plus the new `neighbor` if it was added and not already present.

Since we don't know the exact next neighbor from `tree[current_node]` or whether `neighbor` was added to `queue`, we assume that `node` moves to the next neighbor and `queue` updates accordingly.

State: **`queue` contains all its previous elements, plus `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `queue`. `distances` is updated such that the shortest path distance to `neighbor` is `distances[current_node] + 1`, `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`, and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.**

However, for clarity, let's explicitly state the adjustments needed for the next iteration:

State: **`queue` contains all its previous elements, plus `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `queue`. `distances` is updated such that the shortest path distance to `neighbor` is `distances[current_node] + 1`, `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`, and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.**

So, the final state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`queue` contains all its previous elements, plus `neighbor` if `neighbor` is not already in `queue`. `distances` is updated such that the shortest path distance to `neighbor` is `distances[current_node] + 1`, `current_distance` remains equal to `distances[current_node]`, and `node` is the next neighbor in `tree[current_node]`.**
