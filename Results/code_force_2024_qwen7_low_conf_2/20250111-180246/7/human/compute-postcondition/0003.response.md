The code `tree[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list at index `v` in the `tree` list. 

Given the initial state:
- `edges` is `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]`
- `tree` is `[[1], [], []]`

We need to determine which `v` and `u` correspond to each edge. From the edges:
- `(0, 1)` means `v = 0` and `u = 1`
- `(1, 2)` means `v = 1` and `u = 2`
- `(2, 3)` means `v = 2` and `u = 3`

Let's apply the operations one by one:

1. For the first edge `(0, 1)`, `v = 0` and `u = 1`. So, `tree[0].append(1)` results in `tree` becoming `[[1, 1], [], []]`.
2. For the second edge `(1, 2)`, `v = 1` and `u = 2`. So, `tree[1].append(2)` results in `tree` becoming `[[1, 1], [2], []]`.
3. For the third edge `(2, 3)`, `v = 2` and `u = 3`. So, `tree[2].append(3)` results in `tree` becoming `[[1, 1], [2], [3]]`.

After executing all the operations, the updated `tree` is `[[1, 1], [2], [3]]`.

Output State: **`edges` is [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]; `tree` is [[1, 1], [2], [3]]**
