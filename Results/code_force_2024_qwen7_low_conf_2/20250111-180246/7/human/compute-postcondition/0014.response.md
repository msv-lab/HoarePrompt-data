To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements of the loop.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `d` in the range from 0 to `max_distance` inclusive. This means the loop will execute as long as `d` is less than or equal to `max_distance`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `edges` is an empty list.
   - `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges.
   - `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree.
   - `max_distance` is the maximum value in `distances`.
   - `operations` is an empty list.

3. **Key Variables for Loop Execution**:
   - `d`: The loop variable that iterates from 0 to `max_distance`.
   - `max_distance`: Determines the upper limit of the loop.

4. **Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `max_distance` must be non-negative (i.e., `max_distance` should be at least 0). If `max_distance` were negative, the loop would not execute since the range function would generate no values.

Given these points, the necessary adjustments are:

- Ensure `max_distance` is non-negative.

Since `edges`, `tree`, `distances`, and `operations` are not directly used to control the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should include the adjustment for `max_distance`.

**State: **`edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges, `distances` is a list of distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices in the tree, `max_distance` must be non-negative, `operations` is an empty list**.
