The code snippet `tree[u].append(v)` implies that the list located at index `u` in the `tree` list (which is initialized as a list of lists) is appended with the value `v`. However, the initial state only provides information about `edges` being a list of tuples and does not give specific values for `tree`, `u`, or `v`. 

Given this, let's assume the following:
- `edges` is a list of tuples, e.g., `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]`.
- `tree` is initially an empty list of lists, i.e., `tree = [[] for _ in range(len(edges))]`.

Let's consider the first tuple from `edges`: `(0, 1)`.
- `u` would be `0` and `v` would be `1`.
- Thus, `tree[0]` will be appended with `1`.

After executing the code, the updated state would be:
- `edges` remains unchanged: `[(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]`.
- `tree` now has the structure: `[ [1], [], [] ]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`edges` is [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]; `tree` is [[1], [], []]**
