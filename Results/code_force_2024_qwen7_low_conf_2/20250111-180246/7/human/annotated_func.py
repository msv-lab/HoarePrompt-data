#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree and its value is a list of neighboring nodes. start_node is an integer representing the starting node for breadth-first search, such that 1 <= start_node <= n, where n is the number of vertices in the tree.

    #The program returns the dictionary 'distances' which contains the shortest distance from the starting node to all nodes that are reachable in the tree
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `tree` representing a tree structure where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes, along with an integer `start_node` indicating the starting node for a breadth-first search (BFS). The function performs a BFS traversal to calculate the shortest distance from the `start_node` to all other nodes that are reachable within the tree. After completing the BFS, the function returns a dictionary `distances` where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is the shortest distance from the `start_node` to that node.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge connecting vertices u and v in the tree. Each vertex is numbered from 1 to n, and no vertex is connected to itself or has more than one edge connecting it to another vertex.
def func_2(n, edges):
    tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `edges` is an empty list, `tree` is a dictionary where for each key `u` from 1 to `n`, the value is a list containing `u-1` followed by all the vertices `v` connected to `u` through the edges.

    return len(operations), operations
    #`The program returns the length of the operations list and the list itself, where each tuple in the list has the form (nodes_at_d[0], d) for each distance d from 0 to max_distance, and nodes_at_d is non-empty`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge connecting vertices `u` and `v`. It constructs a tree representation and calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices. Then, it identifies nodes at each distance level and creates a list of tuples indicating the first node at each distance level along with the distance. Finally, it returns the length of this list and the list itself. The returned list contains tuples of the form `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` for each distance `d` from 0 to the maximum distance, ensuring that `nodes_at_d` is non-empty.
