### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the shortest distances from a given starting node (`start_node`) to all other nodes in the tree.
   - The BFS correctly explores the tree, and the `distances` dictionary is constructed to store the shortest distance from `start_node` to each node.
   - The BFS algorithm ensures that all nodes reachable from `start_node` are visited and their distances are correctly computed.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` constructs the tree from the given edges and calls `func_1` to compute the distances from the root node (node 1) to all other nodes.
   - It then iterates through all possible distances from 0 to the maximum distance found (`max_distance`).
   - For each distance `d`, it collects all nodes that are exactly `d` distance away from the root node (node 1).
   - If there are any nodes at distance `d`, it adds a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the `operations` list, indicating that the first node at that distance should be colored black at that distance.
   - This process ensures that each node is eventually colored black, as it considers all nodes at each distance level.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The BFS in `func_1` is implemented correctly and will accurately compute the shortest distances from the starting node.
   - The logic in `func_2` to construct the tree and determine the operations is sound. It correctly identifies the first node at each distance level and ensures that all nodes are colored black using the minimum number of operations.
   - The output format matches the requirements, specifying the minimum number of operations and listing the operations needed to color all nodes black.

4. **Annotations and Example Execution:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The example execution in the annotated code demonstrates how the program works, confirming that it correctly computes the required operations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the correct implementation of the BFS and the logical steps in `func_2`, the program should correctly find a sequence of operations to color all nodes in the tree black using the minimum possible number of operations.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the program's logic and its compliance with the problem requirements.
