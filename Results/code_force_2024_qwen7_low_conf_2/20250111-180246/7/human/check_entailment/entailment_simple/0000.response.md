Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that all vertices are colored black using the minimum possible number of operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**:
   - The function `func_2` constructs the tree and computes distances from node 1 to all other nodes. However, it then proceeds to color nodes based on these distances without ensuring that each operation colors the necessary set of nodes optimally.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is flawed because it simply selects the first node at each distance level and does not guarantee that the selected nodes are sufficient to cover all nodes in the tree. 

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the example test case given:
     ```
     4
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     ```
   - The distances computed from node 1 are:
     ```
     {1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}
     ```
   - According to the flawed logic in `func_2`, the operations would be:
     ```
     (2, 1)
     (3, 1)
     (4, 1)
     ```
   - This results in three operations, but the optimal solution should be just one operation:
     ```
     (1, 0)
     ```
   - This shows that the current implementation does not minimize the number of operations required.

3. **Optimal Solution Requirement**:
   - The problem requires finding a sequence of operations that colors all nodes with the minimum number of operations. The provided code does not enforce this constraint and instead relies on a suboptimal approach.

4. **General Case Consideration**:
   - For more complex trees, the current logic might lead to more operations than necessary. For instance, consider a tree where multiple nodes are at the same distance from the root. The current approach would color these nodes individually, potentially leading to redundant operations.

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to identify the optimal nodes to color at each step to ensure all nodes are covered with the minimum number of operations. This involves a more sophisticated algorithmic approach, such as using a breadth-first search (BFS) to propagate the coloring efficiently.
