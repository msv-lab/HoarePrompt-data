Reasoning:
1. The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the shortest distances from a starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
3. `func_2` constructs the tree from the given edges, then uses `func_1` to compute the distances from the root node (node 1). After that, it iterates through all possible distances and selects one node at each distance to color black, ensuring all nodes are eventually colored.
4. The program correctly identifies that the number of operations needed is equal to the maximum distance in the tree plus one (since all nodes are reachable within this distance).
5. The output format matches the requirements: it specifies the minimum number of operations and lists the operations needed to color all nodes black.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program should correctly find a sequence of operations to color all nodes in the tree black using the minimum possible number of operations.

Correctness: **True**
