You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, all
vertices are colored white.

You can perform the following two-step operation:

  1. Choose a vertex v (1 \leq v \leq n ) and a distance d (0 \leq d \leq n-1 ). 
  2. For all vertices u (1 \leq u \leq n ) such that \text{dist}^\dagger(u,v)=d , color u black. 

Construct a sequence of operations to color all the nodes in the tree black
using the minimum possible number of operations. It can be proven that it is
always possible to do so using at most n operations.

^\dagger \text{dist}(x, y) denotes the number of edges on the (unique) simple
path between vertices x and y on the tree.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 200 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^3 ) — the number of vertices of the tree.

The following n - 1 lines of each test case describe the edges of the tree.
The i -th of these lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 \le u_i, v_i \le
n , u_i \neq v_i ), the indices of the vertices connected by the i -th edge.

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^3 .

Output

For each test case, first output a single integer op (1 \le op \le n) , the
minimum number of operations needed to color all vertices of the tree black.

Then, output op lines, each containing 2 integers. The i -th line should
contain the values of v and d chosen for the i -th operation (1 \le v \le n ,
0 \le d \le n - 1 )

You must guarantee that at the end of op operations, all vertices are colored
black.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1

Note

In the first test case, there is only one possible operation, and performing
it gives us a valid answer.

In the second test case, the first operation colors vertex 2 black, and the
second operation colors vertex 1 black. It can be shown that it is impossible
to color both vertices black in one operation, so the minimum number of
operations needed is 2 . Another possible solution is to use the 2 operations:
(u, r) = (1, 0) and (u, r) = (2, 0) .

In the third test case, the first operation colors vertices 2 , 3 and 4 black,
and the second operation colors vertex 1 black. Again, it can be shown that it
is impossible to color all vertices black in 1 operation, so the minimum
number of operations needed is 2 .

In the fourth test case, the first operation colors vertices 4 , 1 and 7
black, the second operation colors vertices 2 , 5 and 6 black while the third
operation colors vertices 3 and 7 black. Notice that it is allowed to color
vertex 7 black twice.

Thus, each node was marked at least once, with node 7 marked twice. It can be
shown that it is impossible to color all vertices black in fewer than 3 moves.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(tree, start_node):
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque([start_node])
    distances = {start_node: 0}
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        current_distance = distances[node]
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if neighbor not in distances:
                distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return distances
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `tree` representing a tree structure where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes, along with an integer `start_node` indicating the starting node for a breadth-first search (BFS). The function performs a BFS traversal to calculate the shortest distance from the `start_node` to all other nodes that are reachable within the tree. After completing the BFS, the function returns a dictionary `distances` where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is the shortest distance from the `start_node` to that node.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, edges):
    tree = {i: [] for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    distances = func_1(tree, 1)
    operations = []
    max_distance = max(distances.values())
    for d in range(max_distance + 1):
        nodes_at_d = [node for (node, dist) in distances.items() if dist == d]
        if nodes_at_d:
            operations.append((nodes_at_d[0], d))
    return (len(operations), operations)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge connecting vertices `u` and `v`. It constructs a tree representation and calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices. Then, it identifies nodes at each distance level and creates a list of tuples indicating the first node at each distance level along with the distance. Finally, it returns the length of this list and the list itself. The returned list contains tuples of the form `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` for each distance `d` from 0 to the maximum distance, ensuring that `nodes_at_d` is non-empty.
