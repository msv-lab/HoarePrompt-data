### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Distance Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function first constructs a tree from the given edges.
   - It then uses `func_1` to compute the shortest distance from the root node (vertex 1) to all other nodes in the tree.
   - This is correctly done and aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Operation Generation:**
   - The function iterates through each distance level from 0 to the maximum distance.
   - For each distance level `d`, it collects all nodes at that distance (`nodes_at_d`).
   - If there are nodes at distance `d`, it appends a tuple `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` to the `operations` list.
   - This ensures that all nodes at each distance level are targeted in subsequent operations.

3. **Correctness of Operations:**
   - The generated operations ensure that each node is colored at least once.
   - The order in which nodes are colored (from closest to farthest) ensures that all nodes are eventually colored black without redundant operations.
   - The number of operations required is exactly the maximum distance in the tree, which is at most `n-1` (since the longest path in a tree with `n` nodes is `n-1` edges).

4. **Output Format:**
   - The function outputs the minimum number of operations (`num_operations`) and the list of operations.
   - Each operation is formatted correctly as `(v, d)` where `v` is a node and `d` is the distance.

Given the above points, the implementation of `func_2` adheres to the problem specification and generates a correct sequence of operations to color all nodes in the tree black using the minimum number of operations.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
