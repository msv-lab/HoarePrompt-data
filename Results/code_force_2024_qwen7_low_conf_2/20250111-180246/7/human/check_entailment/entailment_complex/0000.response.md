### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest distance from a specified starting node (`start_node`) to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It correctly initializes a queue with the starting node and uses a dictionary `distances` to store the shortest distance from the starting node to each node.
   - The function ensures that all reachable nodes are processed and their distances are correctly computed.
   - The final state of the program after `func_1` is that it returns the correct dictionary of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function first constructs the tree using the given edges and then calls `func_1` to compute the distances from node 1 to all other nodes.
   - It then iterates over the possible distances (from 0 to the maximum distance) and collects nodes at each distance level.
   - The collected nodes at each distance level are used to form a list of tuples `(nodes_at_d[0], d)`, where `nodes_at_d` is a non-empty list of nodes at distance `d` from the starting node.
   - The function correctly computes the minimum number of operations required by counting the number of unique distance levels with non-empty nodes.

3. **Program Execution Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly calls `func_2` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.
   - It correctly outputs the number of operations and the sequence of operations needed to color all nodes black, which matches the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It constructs the tree, computes the necessary distances, and generates the sequence of operations to color all nodes black using the minimum number of steps.
