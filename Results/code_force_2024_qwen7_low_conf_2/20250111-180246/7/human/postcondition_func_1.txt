The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, and `edges`, a list of tuples where each tuple `(u, v)` represents an edge connecting vertices `u` and `v`. It constructs a tree representation and calculates the distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices. Then, it identifies nodes at each distance level and creates a list of tuples indicating the first node at each distance level along with the distance. Finally, it returns the length of this list and the list itself. The returned list contains tuples of the form `(nodes_at_d[0], d)` for each distance `d` from 0 to the maximum distance, ensuring that `nodes_at_d` is non-empty.
