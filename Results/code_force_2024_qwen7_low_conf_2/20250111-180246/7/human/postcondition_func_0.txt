The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `tree` representing a tree structure where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes, along with an integer `start_node` indicating the starting node for a breadth-first search (BFS). The function performs a BFS traversal to calculate the shortest distance from the `start_node` to all other nodes that are reachable within the tree. After completing the BFS, the function returns a dictionary `distances` where each key is a node in the tree and its corresponding value is the shortest distance from the `start_node` to that node.
