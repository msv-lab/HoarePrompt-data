Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. edges is a list of tuples, where each tuple (u, v) represents an edge connecting vertices u and v in the tree. Each vertex is numbered from 1 to n, and no vertex is connected to itself or has more than one edge connecting it to another vertex.**
