Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It ensures that the number of nodes \( n \) is within the specified range \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).

2. **Parent Relationship Construction**: The program constructs the parent relationship list `fa` correctly by mapping each node to its parent node. This is crucial for the dynamic programming approach used later.

3. **String Processing**: The program reads the string `S` indicating the type of each student. It correctly initializes the dynamic programming arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to handle the minimum costs under different conditions.

4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The program iterates backward through the nodes, updating the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays based on the type of each student. This logic correctly accounts for the need to install thick walls to prevent music from reaching sleeping students. The transitions in the dynamic programming arrays are correct:
   - If the current student type is 'S' (sleepy student), the cost is set to infinity to ensure that no music reaches them.
   - If the current student type is 'P' (partying student), the cost is also set to infinity to ensure that the music reaches the end of the tree.
   - The program then updates the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays based on whether placing a thick wall would be beneficial.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`, which correctly represents the minimum number of thick walls needed to satisfy the conditions.

Given that the program correctly implements the dynamic programming solution and follows the specified logic without any logical errors, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
