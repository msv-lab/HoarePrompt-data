Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of thick walls required to ensure that partying students can play music without sleepy students hearing it. Specifically, the logic used to update `dp1` and `dp2` does not properly account for the propagation of music through the tree structure.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
3
3
1 1
CSP
4
1 2 2
PCSS
4
1 2 2
PPSS
```

### Expected Output:
```
1
1
2
```

### Program Output:
```
1
1
2
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Input**
   ```
   3
   1 1
   CSP
   ```

   - Tree Structure: `1 - 2 - 3`
   - `dp1`: Array to store the minimum number of walls required if the root (room 1) is not a partying student.
   - `dp2`: Array to store the minimum number of walls required if the root (room 1) is a partying student.

   The program calculates `dp1[1]` and `dp2[1]` incorrectly because it does not handle the case where the root node itself could be a partying student and thus needs walls to prevent music from reaching sleeping students.

2. **Case 2: Input**
   ```
   4
   1 2 2
   PCSS
   ```

   - Tree Structure: `1 - 2 - 3 - 4`
   - The program should calculate the minimum number of walls such that the music from room 2 (party) does not reach room 3 (sleep) and room 4 (sleep).

   However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the propagation of music through the tree.

3. **Case 3: Input**
   ```
   4
   1 2 2
   PPSS
   ```

   - Tree Structure: `1 - 2 - 3 - 4`
   - Here, both room 2 and room 3 are partying students. The program should calculate the minimum number of walls such that the music from room 2 does not reach room 3 and room 4, and the music from room 3 does not reach room 4.

   The current implementation does not correctly propagate the logic to ensure that both partying students can play music without disturbing sleeping students.

Given these issues, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
