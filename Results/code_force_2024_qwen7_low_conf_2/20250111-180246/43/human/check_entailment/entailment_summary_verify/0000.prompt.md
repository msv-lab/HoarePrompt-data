You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a son who really wanted to go to MIT. The college dormitory at
MIT (Moldova Institute of Technology) can be represented as a tree with n
vertices, each vertex being a room with exactly one student. A tree is a
connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges.

Tonight, there are three types of students:

  * students who want to party and play music (marked with \texttt{P} ), 
  * students who wish to sleep and enjoy silence (marked with \texttt{S} ), and 
  * students who don't care (marked with \texttt{C} ). 

Initially, all the edges are thin walls which allow music to pass through, so
when a partying student puts music on, it will be heard in every room.
However, we can place some thick walls on any edges — thick walls don't allow
music to pass through them.

The university wants to install some thick walls so that every partying
student can play music, and no sleepy student can hear it.

Because the university lost a lot of money in a naming rights lawsuit, they
ask you to find the minimum number of thick walls they will need to use.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10^5 ) —
the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers a_2, \dots , a_n (1
\leq a_i < i ) — it means there is an edge between i and a_i in the tree.

The third line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of
characters \texttt{P} , \texttt{S} , and \texttt{C} , denoting that student i
is of type s_i .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of thick
walls needed.

    1 1

Output

    1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first case, we can install one thick wall between rooms 1 and 2 , as
shown below. We cannot install 0 walls, since then the music from room 3 will
reach room 2 where a student wants to sleep, so the answer is 1 . There are
other valid solutions.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        fa = [-1] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        S = input()
        (dp1, dp2) = ([0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1))
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if S[i] == 'S':
                dp1[i] = float('inf')
            elif S[i] == 'P':
                dp2[i] = float('inf')
            p = fa[i] - 1
            if p != -1:
                dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)
                dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])
        print(min(dp1[0], dp2[0]))



- Function Summary: 
- The function correctly handles the range constraints for the number of test cases (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) and the number of nodes (`2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`).
- However, the function assumes that the input format is always correct and does not include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect lengths of `fa` or `S`).

The function performs the following actions:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of nodes, constructs the parent relationship list `fa`, and reads the string `S`.
- It initializes two dynamic programming arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store the minimum costs.
- It iterates backward through the nodes, updating the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays based on the type of each student in the string `S`.
- It prints the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`, which represents the minimum cost to reach the end of the string `S` under the specified conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of thick walls required to ensure that partying students can play music without sleepy students hearing it. Specifically, the logic used to update `dp1` and `dp2` does not properly account for the propagation of music through the tree structure.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
3
3
1 1
CSP
4
1 2 2
PCSS
4
1 2 2
PPSS
```

### Expected Output:
```
1
1
2
```

### Program Output:
```
1
1
2
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Case 1: Input**
   ```
   3
   1 1
   CSP
   ```

   - Tree Structure: `1 - 2 - 3`
   - `dp1`: Array to store the minimum number of walls required if the root (room 1) is not a partying student.
   - `dp2`: Array to store the minimum number of walls required if the root (room 1) is a partying student.

   The program calculates `dp1[1]` and `dp2[1]` incorrectly because it does not handle the case where the root node itself could be a partying student and thus needs walls to prevent music from reaching sleeping students.

2. **Case 2: Input**
   ```
   4
   1 2 2
   PCSS
   ```

   - Tree Structure: `1 - 2 - 3 - 4`
   - The program should calculate the minimum number of walls such that the music from room 2 (party) does not reach room 3 (sleep) and room 4 (sleep).

   However, the current implementation might not correctly handle the propagation of music through the tree.

3. **Case 3: Input**
   ```
   4
   1 2 2
   PPSS
   ```

   - Tree Structure: `1 - 2 - 3 - 4`
   - Here, both room 2 and room 3 are partying students. The program should calculate the minimum number of walls such that the music from room 2 does not reach room 3 and room 4, and the music from room 3 does not reach room 4.

   The current implementation does not correctly propagate the logic to ensure that both partying students can play music without disturbing sleeping students.

Given these issues, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
