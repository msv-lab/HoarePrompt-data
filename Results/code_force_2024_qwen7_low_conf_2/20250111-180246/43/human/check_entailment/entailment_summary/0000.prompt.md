You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Vladislav has a son who really wanted to go to MIT. The college dormitory at
MIT (Moldova Institute of Technology) can be represented as a tree with n
vertices, each vertex being a room with exactly one student. A tree is a
connected undirected graph with n vertices and n-1 edges.

Tonight, there are three types of students:

  * students who want to party and play music (marked with \texttt{P} ), 
  * students who wish to sleep and enjoy silence (marked with \texttt{S} ), and 
  * students who don't care (marked with \texttt{C} ). 

Initially, all the edges are thin walls which allow music to pass through, so
when a partying student puts music on, it will be heard in every room.
However, we can place some thick walls on any edges — thick walls don't allow
music to pass through them.

The university wants to install some thick walls so that every partying
student can play music, and no sleepy student can hear it.

Because the university lost a lot of money in a naming rights lawsuit, they
ask you to find the minimum number of thick walls they will need to use.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10^5 ) —
the number of vertices in the tree.

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers a_2, \dots , a_n (1
\leq a_i < i ) — it means there is an edge between i and a_i in the tree.

The third line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting of
characters \texttt{P} , \texttt{S} , and \texttt{C} , denoting that student i
is of type s_i .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of thick
walls needed.

Example

Input

    3

    1 1
    
    CSP
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PCSS
    
    4
    
    1 2 2
    
    PPSS

Output

    1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first case, we can install one thick wall between rooms 1 and 2 , as
shown below. We cannot install 0 walls, since then the music from room 3 will
reach room 2 where a student wants to sleep, so the answer is 1 . There are
other valid solutions.

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        fa = [-1] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        S = input()
        (dp1, dp2) = ([0] * (n + 1), [0] * (n + 1))
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if S[i] == 'S':
                dp1[i] = float('inf')
            elif S[i] == 'P':
                dp2[i] = float('inf')
            p = fa[i] - 1
            if p != -1:
                dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)
                dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])
        print(min(dp1[0], dp2[0]))





# Execution Summary:
- The function correctly handles the range constraints for the number of test cases (`1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`) and the number of nodes (`2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`).
- However, the function assumes that the input format is always correct and does not include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer values, incorrect lengths of `fa` or `S`).

The function performs the following actions:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the number of nodes, constructs the parent relationship list `fa`, and reads the string `S`.
- It initializes two dynamic programming arrays `dp1` and `dp2` to store the minimum costs.
- It iterates backward through the nodes, updating the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays based on the type of each student in the string `S`.
- It prints the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]`, which represents the minimum cost to reach the end of the string `S` under the specified conditions.
