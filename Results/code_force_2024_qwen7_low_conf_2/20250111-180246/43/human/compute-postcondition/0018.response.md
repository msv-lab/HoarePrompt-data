To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop's behavior and the conditions it checks.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `fa[0]` is `-1`.
   - The rest of the elements in `fa` are integers from the input.
   - `S` is the value of `input()`.
   - `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1` with specific updates based on the condition `p != -1`.

3. **Update Conditions**:
   - For each `i` in the range from `n-1` to `0`, the loop updates `dp1` and `dp2` based on the value of `fa[i]`:
     - If `fa[i] != -1`, then:
       - `dp1[i] = dp1[i] + min(dp1[fa[i]], dp2[fa[i]] + 1)`
       - `dp2[i] = dp2[i] + min(dp1[fa[i]] + 1, dp2[fa[i]])`
     - If `fa[i] == -1`, then:
       - `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` remain unchanged.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - At the end of the last iteration (i.e., when `i` is `0`), the loop variable `i` will decrement to `-1` (which is out of the loop range), so the loop will terminate.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than or equal to `1`.

Given the current state where `i` is `0`, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be `1`.

### Adjusted States:

- `t` remains as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` must still be at least 1.
- `fa[0]` remains `-1`.
- The rest of the elements in `fa` remain the same.
- `S` remains the value of `input()`.
- `dp1` and `dp2` are updated based on the last iteration, but for the next iteration, they need to be initialized or updated before the loop starts again.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`, `i` is 1**
