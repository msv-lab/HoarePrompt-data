`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged because the input is used to assign a new value to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer**
