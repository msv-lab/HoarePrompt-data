The code `dp2[p] += min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` updates the value of `dp2[p]` based on the minimum of `dp1[i] + 1` and `dp2[i]`. Since the initial value of `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`, the expression `dp1[i] + 1` will be `float('inf') + 1`, which is still `float('inf')`. Therefore, the expression `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` simplifies to `dp2[i]`.

Given this, the code effectively updates `dp2[p]` to be equal to `dp2[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `dp1[p]` is `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[p]` is `dp2[i]`, and `dp2[i]` remains unchanged.**
