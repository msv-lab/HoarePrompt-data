Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`.

### Loop Body:
The loop iterates from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order.

### End of Previous Iteration:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are modified based on the value of `p`.
- If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is set to 0 and `dp2[p]` is set to `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`.
- Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists `dp1` and `dp2`, and the values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain the same.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- `dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`.

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues if `i >= 0`.
2. **Adjust `i`**: Since the loop is iterating in reverse, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
3. **Adjust `p`**: The value of `p` remains unchanged unless it was modified within the loop body.
4. **Adjust `dp1` and `dp2`**: Depending on the value of `p`:
   - If `p` is not equal to -1, `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are updated.
   - Otherwise, they remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, we adjust the following:
- `i` becomes `n - 2` (since `i` is decremented by 1).
- `p` remains the same unless it was updated within the loop body.
- `dp1` and `dp2` remain unchanged unless `p` was not -1.

Given the problem description, since no specific update was mentioned for `dp1` and `dp2` outside the conditional update, we assume they remain unchanged unless `p` was not -1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`. If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is 0 and `dp2[p]` is `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists `dp1` and `dp2` and the values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain as they were initially.**
