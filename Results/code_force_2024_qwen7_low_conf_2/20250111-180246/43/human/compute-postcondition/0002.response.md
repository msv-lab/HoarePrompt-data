`fa` is assigned a list starting with `-1` followed by integers split from the input. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers, which are converted to a list of integers and concatenated with the initial `-1`. The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `fa` is a list where `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input.**
