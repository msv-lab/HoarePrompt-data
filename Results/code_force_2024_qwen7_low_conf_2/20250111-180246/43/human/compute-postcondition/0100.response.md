Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros with length `n + 1`.
   - `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The line `dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` updates the value of `dp1[p]` by adding to it the minimum of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i] + 1`.
   - Here, `i` is `n - 2`, so we substitute `i` with `n - 2`.
   - The value of `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, so we substitute `p` with `fa[n-2] - 1`.

3. **Impact on Variables:**
   - Since `dp1` and `dp2` are initially lists of zeros, `dp1[i]` (which is `dp1[n-2]`) is 0.
   - The value of `dp2[i]` (which is `dp2[n-2]`) is also 0 unless `dp2[n-1]` was set to `float('inf')`, but since we're using `dp2[i]` which is `dp2[n-2]`, it remains 0.
   - Thus, `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` simplifies to `min(0, 0 + 1)`, which is 1.

4. **Update Values:**
   - `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1] + 1`.
   - Initially, `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 0, so it becomes 1.

5. **Final Output State:**
   - `dp1` and `dp2` remain lists of zeros except that `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is now 1.
   - `i` is still `n - 2`.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `p` is still `fa[n-2] - 1`.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros except `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2` is a list of zeros with `dp2[n - 1]` possibly being `float('inf')`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.**
