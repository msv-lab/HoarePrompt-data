Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, and `i` is `i - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'S' and `p` is not `-1`, then `dp1[p]` is set to `1`. If `S[i]` is 'P' and `p` is not `-1`, then `dp2[p-1]` is set to `1`. No other changes are made to the variables.***
