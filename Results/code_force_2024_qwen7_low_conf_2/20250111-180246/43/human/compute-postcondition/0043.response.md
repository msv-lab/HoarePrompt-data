Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Initial States
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `fa[0]` is -1
- `S` is the input string from the user
- `fa` is a list starting with -1 followed by integers from the split and converted input string `S`
- `dp1` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`
- `dp2` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`

### For Loop Details
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Range of the For Loop**: The loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive).
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is non-negative. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1.

### Required Adjustments
- Since the loop runs from `n - 1` down to `0`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
- The initial values of `dp1` and `dp2` being lists of zeros of length `n + 1` will automatically be valid as long as `n` is a positive integer.
- The value of `fa[0]` being `-1` is already given and does not affect the loop condition directly.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `n` must be at least 1.

### Final Answer
State: **`total` is 0, `n` must be at least 1**
