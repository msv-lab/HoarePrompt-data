The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `i`, `S`, `dp1`, `dp2`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, `i` is `i_prev - 1`, If `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `dp2[i]` is either infinity or updated based on the condition `S[i] == 'P'`. If `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `dp2[i]` remains infinity.**
