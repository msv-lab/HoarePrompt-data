`dp1[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. The value of `total` remains 0, `n` remains at least 1, and the character at index `i` in `S` remains 'S'. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in `S` is 'S'; `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, and the current value of `i` is such that the character at index `i` in `S` is 'S'; `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`**.
