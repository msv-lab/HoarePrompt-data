The code assigns the value `float('inf')` to `dp1[i]`. The value of `i` is `i_prev - 1`, and this value does not change. The state of `total` and `n` remains unchanged, and `p` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev - 1`, and `dp1[i]` is set to infinity.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev - 1`, `dp1[i]` is set to infinity**
