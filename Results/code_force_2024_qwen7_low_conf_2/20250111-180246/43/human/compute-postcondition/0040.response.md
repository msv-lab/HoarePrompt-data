The initial state is defined as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `fa[0]` is -1
- `S` is the value of `input()`
- `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`

The code snippet changes the following:
- `fa` is updated to include -1 followed by integers obtained from splitting the input string `S` and converting each substring to an integer.

After executing the code, the output state will be:
- `t` is unchanged and still satisfies \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `n` remains as an input integer
- `fa[0]` is -1
- `S` remains as the value of `input()`
- `fa` is updated to be a list starting with -1 followed by integers from the split and converted input string `S`
- `dp1` and `dp2` remain as lists of zeros of length `n + 1`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `fa[0]` is -1, `S` is the value of `input()`, `fa` is a list starting with -1 followed by integers from the split and converted input string `S`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`**
