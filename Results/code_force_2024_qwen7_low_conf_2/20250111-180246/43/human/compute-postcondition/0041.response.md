The code `S = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `S`. This means that the string `S` is updated with the new input, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `fa[0]` is -1, `S` is the input string from the user, `fa` is a list starting with -1 followed by integers from the split and converted input string `S`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1**
