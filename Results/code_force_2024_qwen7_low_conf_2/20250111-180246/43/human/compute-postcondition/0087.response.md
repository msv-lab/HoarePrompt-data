Postcondition: ***`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` is `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`. If `S[i]` is 'P', then `dp2[n - 1]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
