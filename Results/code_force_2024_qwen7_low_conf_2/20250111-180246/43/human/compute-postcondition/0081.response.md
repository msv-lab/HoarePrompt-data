To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `fa` is the list derived from the input string `S`.
- `S` is the input string.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range of the Loop**: The loop iterates over the range `n - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Initialization of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = n - 1` and decrements until `i = 0`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be `n - 1`.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will be used in the loop, starting from `n - 1` and decrementing to `0`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros with length `n + 1`. These lists are initialized correctly based on the provided information.
   - `fa` and `S` are derived from the input string `S`, and they do not directly affect the loop execution (assuming `fa` is properly initialized from `S`).

### Conclusion:
The key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
