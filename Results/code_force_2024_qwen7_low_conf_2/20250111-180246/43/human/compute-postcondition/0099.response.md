The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.

The initial conditions are:
- `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.

The code does not change the values of `dp1` or `dp2`, nor does it modify `i`, `n`, or `p` further in this snippet. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of a new value to `p`.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.**
