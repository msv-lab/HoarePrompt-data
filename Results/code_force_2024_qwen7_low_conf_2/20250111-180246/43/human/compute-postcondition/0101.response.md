`dp2[p]` is assigned the value of `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, and other variables remain unchanged, the updated state is as follows:

- `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` remains 1.
- `dp2[p]` is updated to the value of `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`, which is `min(1 + 1, dp2[n-2])` or `min(2, dp2[n-2])`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.**
