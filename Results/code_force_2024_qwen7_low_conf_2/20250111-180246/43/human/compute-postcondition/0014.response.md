Postcondition: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa` is a list where `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, and the current value of `p` is not -1**
