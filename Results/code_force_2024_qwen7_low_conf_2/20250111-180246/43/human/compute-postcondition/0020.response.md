`dp2[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means that `dp2[1]` is set to infinity (`float('inf')`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`, `dp2[1]` is `float('inf')`, `i` is 2**
