The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`, an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of students.
- A list `a` containing `n-1` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < i, indicating the edges of the tree connecting the students.
- `s`, a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C', indicating the type of each student.

Additionally, it is stated that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Based on the given output cases, the function will return different values depending on the input conditions, but since no specific return values are mentioned in the problem statement, we can only describe the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `s`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'P', 'S', and 'C'.**
