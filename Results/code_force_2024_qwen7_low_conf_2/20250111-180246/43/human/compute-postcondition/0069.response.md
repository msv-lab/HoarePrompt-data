Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev - 1`. If `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `dp2[i]` is either infinity or updated based on the condition `S[i] == 'P'`. If `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `dp2[i]` remains infinity.***
