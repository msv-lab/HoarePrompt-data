`dp1[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. The value of `i` is `n - 3`, and the value of `n` is greater than 0. The value of `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, and `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`. The value of `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, which is unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1**
