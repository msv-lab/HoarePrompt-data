The code snippet sets `dp1[i]` to `float('inf')`. This means that the value of `dp1[i]` is now `float('inf')`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`, `p` is an integer equal to `fa[2] - 1`, and `i` is \( i - 1 \); `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`.**
