Postcondition: ***`dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros with length `n + 1`, where `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`. `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`. If `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[n - 2]` is set to `float('inf')`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists `dp1` and `dp2`, and the values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain as they were initially.***
