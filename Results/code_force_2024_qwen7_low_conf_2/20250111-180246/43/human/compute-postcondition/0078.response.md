The code reads input as a list of integers and appends -1 at the beginning. This means the variable `fa` is updated, and the other variables (`dp1`, `dp2`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated `fa` and the unchanged `dp1`, `dp2`, and `n`.

Output State: **`dp1` and `dp2` are lists where each element is the result of the backward propagation updates based on the conditions inside the next iteration, `n` is the input integer, `fa` is the list `[-1, integer1, integer2, ..., integerN]` derived from the input string `S`, and the minimum value between `dp1[0]` and `dp2[0]` will be printed after the next iteration.**
