The code snippet sets `dp2[i]` to `float('inf')`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 2`, and `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except possibly `dp2[n - 1]` which may be `float('inf')`. The code does not change `dp1`, and the values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `dp1` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.
- `dp2` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may still be `float('inf')`.
- `dp2[i]` (which is `dp2[n - 2]`) is now set to `float('inf')`.
- `p` remains `fa[n-2] - 1`.
- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `dp2[n - 2]` is `float('inf')`, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0.**
