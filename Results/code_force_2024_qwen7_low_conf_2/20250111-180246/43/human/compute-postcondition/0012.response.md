Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa` is a list where `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. If the current character in the string `S` is 'S', `dp1[i]` is set to positive infinity. If the current character in the string `S` is 'P', `dp2[i]` is set to positive infinity.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states after executing the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts.
