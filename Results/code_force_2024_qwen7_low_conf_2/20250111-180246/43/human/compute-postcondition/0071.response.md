`dp1[p]` is assigned the value of `dp1[p]` plus the minimum of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i] + 1`. Since `p` is defined as `fa[i] - 1`, the value of `p` is derived from `i`. The values of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` are checked to determine the minimum value to add to `dp1[p]`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, `i` is `i_prev - 1`, `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, If `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to infinity, otherwise `dp2[i]` is either infinity or updated based on the condition `S[i] == 'P'`. If `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[i]` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `dp2[i]` remains infinity.**
