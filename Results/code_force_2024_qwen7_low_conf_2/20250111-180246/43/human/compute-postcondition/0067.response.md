The code initializes `dp2[i]` to infinity (`float('inf')`). Since `i` is defined as `i_prev - 1`, `i` has the value `i_prev - 1`. The value of `total` remains 0, `n` remains at least 1, and `p` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev - 1`, `dp2[i]` is infinity**
