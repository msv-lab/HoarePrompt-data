Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `total` is 0
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `p` is `fa[i] - 1`
   - If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. If `p == -1`, no updates are performed to `dp1` and `dp2`.

2. **Loop Statement**: The loop iterates from `i = n - 1` down to `i = 0`.

3. **Conditions for Continuing the Loop**: For the loop to continue executing, the value of `i` must be within the bounds specified by the loop statement, i.e., `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to some value based on the loop decrementing from `n-1` downwards.
   - To continue the loop, `i` needs to be decremented further such that it still satisfies the loop condition `0 <= i < n`.

5. **Determining the New State**:
   - If `i` was at the end of the previous iteration, say `i` was `k` (where `0 <= k < n`), then for the loop to continue, `i` must now be `k-1`.
   - Since `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k-1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` before, it should now be `k-1` to continue the loop.

6. **Final State**:
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `p` is now `fa[k-1] - 1` (where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - Depending on whether `p != -1`, `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` will be updated as per the conditions given.

Given the above reasoning, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` should be `k-1`. 

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `p` is `fa[i-1] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i-1], dp2[i-1] + 1)` and `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i-1] + 1, dp2[i-1])`. If `p == -1`, no updates are performed to `dp1` and `dp2`.**
