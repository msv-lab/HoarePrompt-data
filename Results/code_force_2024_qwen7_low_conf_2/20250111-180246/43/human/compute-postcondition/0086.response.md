The code `dp2[i] = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to `dp2[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, this means `dp2[n - 1]` is set to `float('inf')`. The values of the other variables (`dp1`, `dp2`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` is `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**
