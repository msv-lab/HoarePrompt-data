Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`, `p` is an integer equal to `fa[2] - 1`, and `i` is \( i - 1 \). If `S[i]` is 'S', then `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`. If `S[i]` is 'P', then `dp2[i-1]` is set to `float('inf')`.***
