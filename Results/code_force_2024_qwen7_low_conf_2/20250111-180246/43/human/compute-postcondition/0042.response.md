The code initializes two lists, `dp1` and `dp2`, both filled with zeros of length `n + 1`. This means that `dp1` and `dp2` are now lists where each element is set to 0, and the length of these lists is `n + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `fa`, and `S`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer; `fa[0]` is -1; `S` is the input string from the user; `fa` is a list starting with -1 followed by integers from the split and converted input string `S`; `dp1` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`; `dp2` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.**
