The code snippet `dp1[p] += min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` updates the value of `dp1[p]`. Given the initial state, `dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`, and the current value of `p` is not equal to -1.

First, let's determine the values of `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]`:
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `dp1[i]` is `dp1[n - 1]`, which is 0 (as it is initialized to zero).
- Similarly, `dp2[i]` is `dp2[n - 1]`, which may be `float('inf')`.

Now, evaluate `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`:
- `dp1[i]` is 0.
- `dp2[i] + 1` is `float('inf') + 1`, which is still `float('inf')`.

Therefore, `min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)` is 0.

Since `dp1[p]` is updated by adding 0 to its current value, `dp1[p]` remains unchanged. Thus, the value of `dp1[p]` is still 0.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`, and the current value of `p` is not equal to -1; `dp1[p]` is 0.**
