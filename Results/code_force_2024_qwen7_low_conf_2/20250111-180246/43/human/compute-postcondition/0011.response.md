Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa` is a list where `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list where `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')` and the rest of the elements are 0. If `S[i]` is 'P', the program continues as specified in the if part. Since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged after the if statement executes.***
