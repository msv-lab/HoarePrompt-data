Postcondition: ***`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`. If `p` is not equal to -1, then `dp1[p]` is 0 and `dp2[p]` is `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`. Otherwise, no changes are made to the lists `dp1` and `dp2` and the values of `p`, `i`, and `n` remain as they were initially.***
