Postcondition: ***`dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided and there is no alternative action when the condition `p != -1` is false, the overall postcondition simply reflects the state resulting from the if part. Therefore, the variables `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]`, `dp2[p]`, `i`, `n`, and `p` maintain the specified values after the if statement executes.
