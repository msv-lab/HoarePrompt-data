The code updates two variables, `dp2[p]` and `dp1[p]`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the changes:

- `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i] + 1)`.
- `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.

Since the initial values of `dp1` and `dp2` are all zeros, the minimum values used in the expressions will be zero initially. Therefore, the updates will be:

- `dp1[p]` becomes `0 + min(0, 0 + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1`.
- `dp2[p]` becomes `0 + min(0 + 1, 0 + 1) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \( 1 \leq t \leq 1000 \), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` is a list of zeros with a `1` at index `p`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with a `1` at index `p`, `p` is `fa[i] - 1`, `i` is `i - 1`**.
