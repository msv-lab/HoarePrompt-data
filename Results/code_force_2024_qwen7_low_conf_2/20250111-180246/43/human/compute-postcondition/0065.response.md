Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `total` is 0
- `n` is at least 1
- If `p` is not -1, then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`, `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')`, and `dp2[p]` is set to `dp2[i]`.
- If `p` is -1, no changes occur to any variables.

### Loop Information:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Direction**: The loop starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `0` (inclusive).
2. **Condition to Continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the valid range, i.e., `i >= 0`.

### End of Previous Iteration:
- We need to determine the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
- Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`.

### Adjusting the States:
1. **Value of `i`**: Since the loop iterates from `n - 1` to `0`, if `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i_prev - 1` (assuming `i_prev > 0`).
2. **Value of `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop itself does not modify `n`.
3. **Value of `p`**: The value of `p` remains unchanged because the loop itself does not modify `p` unless specified in the loop body.

### Conclusion:
- If `i_prev` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` should be `i_prev - 1`.
- The value of `n` remains at least 1.
- The value of `p` remains unchanged.

### State Adjustment:
State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev - 1`**

If we assume `i_prev` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration (this is an example; the actual value would depend on the previous iteration), then:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is 1**

If `i_prev` was 0, then:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is -1 (which is out of range, so the loop would terminate)**

Since we don't know the exact value of `i_prev`, the most general form is:

State: **`total` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `p` is unchanged, `i` is `i_prev - 1`**

This ensures that the state correctly reflects the conditions for the next iteration of the loop.
