The code `dp2[i] = float('inf')` assigns the value `float('inf')` to `dp2[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 3`, and the value of `dp2[i]` is updated. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, and `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, and `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`**.
