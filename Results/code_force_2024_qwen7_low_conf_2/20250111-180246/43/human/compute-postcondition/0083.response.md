`dp1[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. This means that the value of `dp1` at index `i` (where `i` is `n - 1`) is set to infinity. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `dp1[i]` is `float('inf')`**
