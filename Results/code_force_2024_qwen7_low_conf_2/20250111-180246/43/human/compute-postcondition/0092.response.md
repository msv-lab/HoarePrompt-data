Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`, the current value of `p` is not equal to -1, `dp1[p]` is 0, `dp2[p]` is `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])`**
