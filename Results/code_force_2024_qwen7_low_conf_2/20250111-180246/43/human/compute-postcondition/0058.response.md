`dp2[i]` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. The value of `dp2[i]` is set to infinity, but the value of `p` and its corresponding `dp1[p]` and `dp2[p]` are not updated because the condition `p != -1` is not met (as per the initial state, `p` is `-1`). The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `p` is `-1`, `dp1[p]` is unchanged, `dp2[p]` is unchanged, `dp2[i]` is `float('inf')`**
