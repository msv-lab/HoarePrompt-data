Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must be at least 1, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1`, `p` is an integer equal to `fa[2] - 1`, and `dp2[p]` is increased by `min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` for the current index `i` if `p` is not equal to -1. If `p` is -1, the state remains unchanged.***
