The code sets `dp1[i]` to `float('inf')`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, this means `dp1[n - 2]` is now `float('inf')`. The other variables (`dp2`, `n`, `i`, and `p`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`, `dp1[n - 2]` is `float('inf')`.**
