The code snippet `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `fa` and `i`. The only specific value known is `i = n - 1`. Therefore, the value of `fa[i] - 1` is dependent on the value of `fa[n-1]`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `fa[n-1]`, `p` will be `fa[n-1] - 1`.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1`.

Output State: **`dp1` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `dp2` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `dp2[n - 1]` may be `float('inf')`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `p` is `fa[n-1] - 1**.
