The code `p = fa[i] - 1` assigns the value of `fa[i] - 1` to the variable `p`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 3` and `fa[n-2] - 1` is equal to `dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]`, which is 1. Therefore, `fa[i]` is `fa[n-3]`. Since `i` is `n - 3`, `fa[i]` would be `fa[n-3]`, and thus `p` becomes `fa[n-3] - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged. So, the output state is:

Output State: **`dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-3] - 1`.**
