Postcondition: ***`dp1[fa[n-2] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-2] - 1`. If `S[i] == 'S'`, then `dp1[i]` is set to `float('inf')` and `dp2[p]` remains unchanged. If `S[i] == 'P'`, then `dp2[i]` remains `float('inf')` and `dp2[p]` remains unchanged.***
