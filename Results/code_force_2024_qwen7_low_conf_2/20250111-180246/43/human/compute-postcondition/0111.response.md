Postcondition: ***`dp1[fa[n-3] - 1]` is 1, `dp2[p]` is `min(2, dp2[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 0, `p` is `fa[n-3] - 1`. If `p != -1`, then `dp1[fa[n-3] - 1]` is updated to `dp1[fa[n-3] - 1] + min(dp1[n-3], dp2[n-3] + 1)` and `dp2[n-3]` is updated to `\min(2, dp2[n-2]) + \min(\text{dp1}[n-3] + 1, \min(2, dp2[n-2]))`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `p == -1`.***
