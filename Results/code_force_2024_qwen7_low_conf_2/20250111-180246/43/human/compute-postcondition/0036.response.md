Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `fa[0]` is -1 and the rest of the elements are integers from the input, `S` is the value of `input()`, `dp1` and `dp2` are lists of zeros of length `n + 1` with the following updates:
- For each `i` from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), if `S[i]` is 'S', then `dp1[p]` is updated to `dp1[p] + min(dp1[i], dp2[i] + 1)`.
- For each `i` from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), if `S[i]` is 'P', then `dp2[p]` is updated to `dp2[p] + min(dp1[i] + 1, dp2[i])` where `p = fa[i] - 1`.
- If `p == -1`, the corresponding `dp1[p]` or `dp2[p]` remains unchanged.**

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed, considering the conditions and updates specified in the loop.
