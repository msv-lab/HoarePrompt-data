t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a list a contains n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < i, indicating the edges of the tree, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C', indicating the type of each student. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
