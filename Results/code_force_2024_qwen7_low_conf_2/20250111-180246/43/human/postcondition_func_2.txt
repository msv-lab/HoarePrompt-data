The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of students \( n \), a list of edges representing direct friendships, and a string indicating the type of each student (either 'P', 'S', or 'C'). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, edges, student_types)` to compute a result based on the given inputs. After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case. If there are fewer than 2 students in any test case, the program will skip processing that test case due to the constraint \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \). Potential edge cases include scenarios where \( n \) is exactly 2 or very close to the upper limit of \( 10^5 \).
