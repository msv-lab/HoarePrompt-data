t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of vertices in a tree. a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i < i, representing the edges connecting the vertices. s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'P', 'S', and 'C', where 'P' represents a partying student, 'S' represents a sleeping student, and 'C' represents a student who doesn't care. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
