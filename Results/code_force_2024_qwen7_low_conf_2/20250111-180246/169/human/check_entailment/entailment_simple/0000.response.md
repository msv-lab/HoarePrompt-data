Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases as described.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - Each test case is processed according to the specified constraints (length of the array `n` and the range of elements `[0, n-1]`).

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function calculates the MEX of the array accurately.
   - It uses a set to track the unique elements present in the array and finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in this set.

3. **Subsegment Division**:
   - The main loop iterates through the array to find subsegments where the MEX is equal to the calculated MEX value.
   - It maintains a set (`num_set`) to track the numbers seen so far in the current subsegment.
   - When the size of `num_set` reaches the MEX value, it indicates that the current subsegment is complete.
   - The subsegment boundaries are recorded and stored in the `segments` list.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If no subsegment is found such that its MEX equals the calculated MEX, the program prints `-1`.
   - If the number of subsegments is less than 2, indicating that a valid division cannot be made, the program again prints `-1`.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs the number of subsegments (`k`) and the boundaries of each subsegment in the required format.
   - It ensures that the subsegments cover the entire array and are contiguous.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
