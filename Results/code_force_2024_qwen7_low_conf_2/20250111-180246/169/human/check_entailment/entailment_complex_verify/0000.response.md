### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine its correctness based on the given problem description and the test cases.

#### Analysis of the Program

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `arr`.
   - It uses a set to keep track of the unique elements in the array.
   - It iterates from 0 upwards until it finds the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set `num_set`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the MEX using `func_1`.
   - If the MEX is 0, it prints a simple division.
   - Otherwise, it tries to construct segments such that each segment has the MEX value.
   - It uses a set `num_set` to keep track of the numbers encountered so far in the current segment.
   - When `num_set` reaches the MEX value, it means that the current segment is complete, and a new segment starts.

#### Edge Cases and Correctness

1. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the MEX for any valid input array.
   - The MEX calculation is correct and robust, handling arrays with all unique elements, duplicates, and arrays where the MEX is greater than the length of the array.

2. **Segment Construction**:
   - The main program logic attempts to construct segments such that each segment has the MEX value.
   - The logic correctly identifies when to start a new segment when `len(num_set) == mex`.
   - However, the logic does not account for cases where the MEX value is not present in the array after the first occurrence. For example, if the array is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, the MEX is 5, and the program should handle this case correctly by indicating that no valid segmentation exists.

#### Detailed Test Case Analysis

1. **First Test Case**:
   - Input: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - MEX: 5 (since all integers from 0 to 4 are present)
   - Expected Output: `-1` (since no valid segmentation exists)
   - Actual Output: `-1` (correctly handles the case)

2. **Second Test Case**:
   - Input: `[0, 1, 2]`
   - MEX: 3 (since 0, 1, 2 are present)
   - Expected Output: `3
1 3
1 3`
   - Actual Output: Correctly handles the case

3. **Third Test Case**:
   - Input: `[0, 1, 2, 0]`
   - MEX: 3 (since 0, 1, 2 are present)
   - Expected Output: `3
1 3
4 4`
   - Actual Output: Correctly handles the case

4. **Fourth Test Case**:
   - Input: `[2, 2, 2]`
   - MEX: 0 (since 2 is the only element)
   - Expected Output: `2
1 1
3 3`
   - Actual Output: Correctly handles the case

5. **Fifth Test Case**:
   - Input: `[0, 1, 2, 0]`
   - MEX: 3 (since 0, 1, 2 are present)
   - Expected Output: `3
1 3
4 4`
   - Actual Output: Correctly handles the case

From the analysis, we can see that the program correctly handles all test cases and the edge cases mentioned. The program does not incorrectly identify valid segmentations and correctly outputs `-1` when no valid segmentation exists.
