### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires dividing the array into `k` subsegments such that the MEX of each subsegment is the same integer.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The program correctly computes the MEX of the entire array using the `func_1` function.
   - The main logic attempts to identify subsegments where the MEX matches the computed MEX.

3. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - **Compute MEX**:
     - The `func_1` function correctly computes the MEX by identifying the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - **Handle MEX = 0**:
     - If the MEX is 0, the program correctly prints `2` subsegments `[1, 1]` and `[2, n]`.
   - **Identify Subsegments**:
     - The program iterates through the array and maintains a set `num_set` to track the numbers from 0 to MEX-1.
     - When the size of `num_set` equals MEX, it adds a new subsegment and resets `num_set`.
     - After the loop, if there are remaining elements in `num_set`, they are merged with the last subsegment.
   - **Check Subsegments**:
     - The program checks if at least two subsegments were found. If so, it prints the number of subsegments and their boundaries; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies subsegments where the MEX matches the required value.
   - The special case where the MEX is 0 is handled correctly.
   - The merging of the last subsegment is done correctly.
   - The conditions for printing `-1` when fewer than two subsegments are found are met.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few edge cases and potential issues:

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where the MEX is 0.
  - The merging of the last subsegment is handled correctly.
  - However, the program may not handle the case where the entire array contains only one type of element (e.g., all elements are 0).

- **Potential Issue**:
  - The program assumes that if the MEX is greater than the length of the array, it will be correctly identified. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where the MEX is greater than the length of the array.
  - Additionally, the program does not explicitly check if the subsegments are disjoint or overlapping, which could lead to incorrect results.

Given these considerations, let's re-evaluate the program:

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Test Case Analysis**:
  - For the test case `5 0 1 2 3 4`, the program correctly identifies that no valid subsegment division exists.
  - For the test case `8 0 1 7 1 0 1 0 3`, the program correctly identifies three subsegments with MEX 2.
  - For the test case `3 2 2 2`, the program correctly identifies three subsegments with MEX 0.
  - For the test case `4 0 1 2 0`, the program correctly identifies two subsegments with MEX 3.

- **Potential Issues**:
  - The program does not handle the case where the entire array contains only one type of element (e.g., all elements are 0).
  - The program does not explicitly check if the subsegments are disjoint or overlapping, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Upon re-evaluation, the program generally follows the correct logic but lacks explicit handling for certain edge cases and potential issues related to subsegment disjointness.

### Final Decision:
Final: **False**

The program is mostly correct but lacks explicit handling for certain edge cases and potential issues related to subsegment disjointness.
