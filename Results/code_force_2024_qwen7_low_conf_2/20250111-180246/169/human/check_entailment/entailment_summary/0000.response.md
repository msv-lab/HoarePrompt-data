Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX of the array. It ensures that all values from 0 to `n-1` are considered and finds the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. The main part of the program attempts to divide the array into segments such that the MEX of each segment is equal to the calculated MEX (`mex`). This is done by tracking the presence of numbers in the current segment until all numbers from 0 to `mex-1` are present.
3. If `mex` is 0, it directly divides the array into two segments `[1, 1]` and `[2, n]` because the MEX of both would be 0.
4. Otherwise, it iterates through the array, adding indices to a segment until all numbers from 0 to `mex-1` are included in the segment. Once this condition is met, it starts a new segment.
5. After processing the array, if there are fewer than 2 segments, it prints `-1` indicating no valid division exists. Otherwise, it prints the number of segments and their respective boundaries.
6. The logic handles edge cases like all numbers being unique or duplicates, ensuring the MEX is correctly identified and segments are formed as needed.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program logic aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.
