### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to divide the array into \( k \) subsegments such that the MEX (Minimum Excludant) for each subsegment is the same integer. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of an array is determined by the absence of certain integers in the array.
   - The program correctly computes the MEX of the entire array using the `func_1` function.
   - The main logic attempts to find subsegments where the MEX matches the computed MEX.

3. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - Compute the MEX of the entire array using `func_1`.
   - If the MEX is 0, the array is trivially split into two subsegments `[1, 1]` and `[2, n]`, as the MEX for both will be 0.
   - Otherwise, iterate through the array to identify subsegments where the count of numbers from 0 to MEX-1 equals MEX. Each such subsegment is identified and stored.
   - If the last subsegment contains any number from 0 to MEX-1, merge it with the previous subsegment.
   - Finally, check if at least two subsegments were found. If so, print the number of subsegments and their boundaries; otherwise, print `-1`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies subsegments where the MEX matches the required value.
   - It handles the special case where the MEX is 0 separately.
   - The merging of the last subsegment is done correctly.
   - The conditions for printing `-1` when fewer than two subsegments are found are met.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Handling the MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the MEX, but the main logic does not handle cases where the MEX is larger than the number of elements in the array. Specifically, if the MEX is greater than the length of the array, the program may incorrectly identify subsegments.

- **Subsegment Merging**: The merging of the last subsegment only occurs if there are remaining elements in the `num_set`. This means that if the MEX is exactly equal to the length of the array, the program will not merge the last subsegment, which might lead to an incorrect result.

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the MEX is exactly equal to the length of the array, which should still produce a valid division. For example, an array like `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (where MEX is 5) should be split into a single subsegment.

Given these observations, the program is not fully correct as it fails to handle edge cases properly and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may produce incorrect results in certain scenarios.
