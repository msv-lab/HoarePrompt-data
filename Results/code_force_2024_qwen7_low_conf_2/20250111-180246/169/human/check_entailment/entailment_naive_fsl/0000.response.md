Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the MEX value is not a valid element in the array. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **MEX Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the MEX value correctly.
2. **Segment Construction**: The program attempts to construct segments such that each segment has the calculated MEX value. However, it fails to handle cases where the MEX value is not present in the array after the first occurrence.

Consider the following input:
```
3
5
0 1 2 3 4
3
0 1 2
4
0 1 2 0
```

- **First Test Case**: The array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` has a MEX value of 5. The program will not correctly handle this case since it expects the MEX value to be within the array bounds.
- **Second Test Case**: The array `[0, 1, 2]` has a MEX value of 3. The program constructs the segments correctly: `[0, 1, 2]` which has a MEX of 3.
- **Third Test Case**: The array `[0, 1, 2, 0]` has a MEX value of 3. The program constructs the segments incorrectly: it might not correctly split the array into segments with the desired MEX values.

The program does not account for cases where the MEX value is not present in the array after the first occurrence, leading to incorrect segmentations. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
