Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the problem and uses a helper function `func_1` to compute the MEX of the array.
2. The main logic of the program iterates through the array and constructs segments based on the MEX value.
3. The logic checks if the MEX is 0, and if so, directly outputs a valid division into two segments.
4. If the MEX is not 0, the program attempts to split the array into segments where each segment's MEX matches the computed MEX.
5. The program correctly handles cases where the array cannot be split into valid segments by outputting `-1`.
6. The overall approach is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It accurately computes the MEX and divides the array into segments such that each segment has the same MEX value, or correctly identifies when such a division is not possible.
