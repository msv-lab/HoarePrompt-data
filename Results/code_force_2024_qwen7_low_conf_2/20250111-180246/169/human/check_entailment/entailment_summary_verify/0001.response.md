### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to divide the array into \( k \) subsegments such that the MEX (Minimum Excludant) for each subsegment is the same integer.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to compute the MEX of the array.
   - The main logic of the program attempts to find subsegments where the MEX matches the computed MEX.

3. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - Compute the MEX of the entire array using `func_1`.
   - If the MEX is 0, directly split the array into two subsegments `[1, 1]` and `[2, n]` since the MEX for both will be 0.
   - Otherwise, iterate through the array to identify subsegments where the count of numbers from 0 to MEX-1 equals MEX. Each such subsegment is identified and stored.
   - If the last subsegment contains any number from 0 to MEX-1, merge it with the previous subsegment.
   - Finally, check if at least two subsegments were found. If so, print the number of subsegments and their boundaries; otherwise, print `-1`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly computes the MEX of the array.
   - It handles all edge cases, including when all integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) are present in the array, and when duplicates are present.

5. **Edge Cases and Missing Functionality**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the MEX is 0.
   - The merging of the last subsegment is handled correctly.
   - The conditions for printing `-1` when less than two subsegments are found are met.

6. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies subsegments where the MEX matches the required value.
   - It handles the special case where the MEX is 0 separately.
   - The merging of the last subsegment is done correctly.
   - The conditions for printing `-1` when less than two subsegments are found are met.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some potential issues with the logic in the program:

- **Merging Subsegments**:
  - The merging logic only checks if the last subsegment contains any number from 0 to MEX-1. This might not always result in a valid subsegment. For example, consider the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with MEX = 5. The subsegments would be `[1, 1]` and `[2, 5]`, which is not valid since `[2, 5]` is out of bounds.

- **Handling Multiple MEX Values**:
  - The program assumes that once a subsegment with the required MEX is found, subsequent subsegments will have the same MEX. However, this assumption might not hold true in all cases. For example, consider the array `[0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3]` with MEX = 4. The program might incorrectly split the array into `[1, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, `[3, 3]`, and `[4, 4]`, which does not satisfy the condition of having the same MEX in each subsegment.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee the correct division into subsegments with the same MEX for all possible inputs.
