Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to divide the array into `k` subsegments such that the MEX (Minimum Excludant) for each subsegment is the same integer.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to compute the MEX of the array.
   - The main logic of the program attempts to find subsegments where the MEX matches the computed MEX.

3. **Key Steps in the Program**:
   - Compute the MEX of the entire array using `func_1`.
   - If the MEX is 0, directly split the array into two subsegments `[1, 1]` and `[2, n]` since the MEX for both will be 0.
   - Otherwise, iterate through the array to identify subsegments where the count of numbers from 0 to MEX-1 equals MEX. Each such subsegment is identified and stored.
   - If the last subsegment contains any number from 0 to MEX-1, merge it with the previous subsegment.
   - Finally, check if at least two subsegments were found. If so, print the number of subsegments and their boundaries; otherwise, print `-1`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies subsegments where the MEX matches the required value.
   - It handles the special case where the MEX is 0 separately.
   - The merging of the last subsegment is done correctly.
   - The conditions for printing `-1` when less than two subsegments are found are met.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
