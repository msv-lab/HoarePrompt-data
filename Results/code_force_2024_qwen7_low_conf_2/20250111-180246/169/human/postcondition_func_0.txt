The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` consisting of integers within the range [0, n-1], where `n` is the length of the list (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). It first creates a set `num_set` containing the unique elements from `arr`. Then, it iterates to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `num_set`. The function returns this integer, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not found in the set of elements from `arr`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If all integers from 0 to n-1 are present in `arr`, the function correctly identifies `n` as the smallest non-negative integer not in `num_set`.
- If `arr` contains duplicate elements, the function still correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer not present in the unique set.
- The function handles the case where the smallest non-negative integer not present is greater than the length of the list, returning a value greater than n-1.
- The function ensures that the returned value is within the range of non-negative integers starting from 0.

After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the original list `arr` and the returned value, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set `num_set`.
