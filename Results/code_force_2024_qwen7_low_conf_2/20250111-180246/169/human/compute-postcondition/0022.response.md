Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have` remains unchanged from its last state except for `cur_have[a[i]]` which is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `cur_have[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, and the condition `(cur_have[a[i]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[i])` is true.**
