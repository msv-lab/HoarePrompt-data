The code `another_have[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the `another_have` array. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. The previous value of `another_have[a[2]]` is 0 (since it was initialized to zeros). After incrementing, `another_have[a[2]]` becomes 1.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `another_have` which now has one of its elements updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 2, and if `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`; otherwise, no change to `cur_mex`.**
