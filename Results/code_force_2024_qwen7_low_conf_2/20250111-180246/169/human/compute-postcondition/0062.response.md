Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is `while another_have[another_mex]:`
- Variables involved:
  - `cur_have[a[0]]` is 0
  - `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0
  - `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0
  - `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`
  - `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.
2. **Initial States**:
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is 0
   - `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0
   - `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0
   - `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`
   - `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`

3. **Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.
   - Since `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`, we need to ensure that there is at least one `a[i]` such that `another_have[a[i]]` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero after the loop initialization.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`, and `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero**
