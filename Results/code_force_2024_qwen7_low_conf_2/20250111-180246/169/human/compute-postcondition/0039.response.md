According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_mex` is `a[2] + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1
- `i` is 2
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 3.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 3, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`.**
