To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `cur_have[cur_mex]` is `True`. This means that the current `cur_mex` value must be present in the `cur_have` list, indicating that the frequency of `cur_mex` in the array `a` is non-zero.

2. **Effect of Loop Execution**:
   - After each iteration of the loop, `cur_mex` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop continues until `cur_mex` reaches a value for which `cur_have[cur_mex]` is `False`.

3. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is an array of length `n`.
   - `cur_mex` starts at 0.
   - `cur_have` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `cur_have[i]` represents the frequency of `i` in the array `a`.

4. **Observation from Given States**:
   - After 1 iteration: `cur_mex` is 1, and `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero.
   - After 2 iterations: `cur_mex` is 2, and `cur_have[1]` must be true.
   - After 3 iterations: `cur_mex` is 3, and `cur_have[2]` must be true.

From these observations, we can infer that the loop will continue to increment `cur_mex` until it finds a value that does not exist in the `cur_have` list (i.e., `cur_have[cur_mex]` is `False`).

### Conclusion

After the loop has finished executing, `cur_mex` will be the smallest integer that does not appear in the array `a`. This is because the loop increments `cur_mex` until it finds the next missing value in the sequence starting from 0.

### Output State

Given that the loop stops when `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array, the final values of the variables will be:
- `t` remains within its original bounds: \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` remains within its original bounds: \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` remains an array of length `n`.
- `cur_mex` will be the smallest integer not present in the array `a`.
- `cur_have` will still represent the frequencies of integers from 0 to `n` in the array `a`, but since the loop has completed, no further updates to `cur_have` will occur.

### Final Output State

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, and `cur_have` remains unchanged from its last state during the loop execution.**
