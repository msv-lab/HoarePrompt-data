The code snippet `cur_mex = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to the variable `cur_mex`. The value of `a[i]` is not specified in the initial state, but it does not affect the variables mentioned in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other i, `cur_mex` is equal to `a[i]`**
