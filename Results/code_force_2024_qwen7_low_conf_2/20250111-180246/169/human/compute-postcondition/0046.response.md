To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The `while` loop condition is `another_have[another_mex]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be true, meaning `another_mex` must be present in the `another_have` array.

From the given state:
- `another_have[a[2]]` is 1
- `another_have[a[4]]` is 1
- `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`

Since `another_mex` can only be `a[2]` or `a[4]`, and both `a[2]` and `a[4]` are already marked as present in `another_have`, `another_have[another_mex]` will always be true.

However, we need to ensure that `another_mex` is actually one of the values that has been marked as present in `another_have`. Given that `another_mex` is either `a[2]` or `a[4]`, and both `a[2]` and `a[4]` are marked, the condition is satisfied.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed to the current state to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is an array of length `n`; `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`; if `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`; `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` is `a[2] + k + 1`; `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1; `i` is 4; `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`; `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`**
