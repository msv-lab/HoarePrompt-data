The code decrements `cur_have[a[i]]` by 1, where `i` is 3. So, `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 4, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`. `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1.**
