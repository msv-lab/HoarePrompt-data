To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is `another_have[another_mex]`. This means the loop will continue as long as `another_mex` is present in the array `another_have` (i.e., `another_have[another_mex] != 0`).

Given the current state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\),
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\),
- `a` is an array of length `n`,
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`,
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1,
- `another_mex` is `a[2] + 1`,
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1,
- `i` is 2,
- If `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `another_mex` must be such that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. Since `another_mex` is defined as `a[2] + 1` and `another_have[a[2]]` is 1, we need to check if `another_mex` is within the bounds of the `another_have` array.

Given `another_mex` is `a[2] + 1`, we need to ensure that `a[2] + 1` is a valid index for `another_have` (which has a length of `n + 1`). Additionally, we need to ensure that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

Since `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` and `a[2]` is an element of the array `a` of length `n`, `a[2]` is guaranteed to be within the range `[0, n - 1]`. Therefore, `a[2] + 1` is within the range `[1, n]`, which is a valid index for `another_have`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `another_mex` is such that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. Given the conditions, this means `another_mex` should be an index where `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `another_mex` should be such that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

Final answer:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + 1` and must be such that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 2, and if `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`.**
