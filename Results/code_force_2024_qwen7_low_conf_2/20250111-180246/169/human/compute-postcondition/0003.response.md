`mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mex` is 0, so after the increment, `mex` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`arr` and `num_set`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` and must contain the element 0; `mex` is 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` and must contain the element 0; `mex` is 1**
