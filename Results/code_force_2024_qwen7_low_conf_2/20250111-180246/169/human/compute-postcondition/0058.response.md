The code snippet `cur_have[a[i]] -= 1` decrements the value of `cur_have[a[i]]` by 1. Given that `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1, it means that `i` starts from 1 (assuming the loop starts from `i = 1`). However, the specific value of `i` is not provided, so we will consider the general case where `i` is incremented in the loop.

Let's analyze the variables involved:

- `cur_have[a[0]]` is already decreased by 1 in the initial state.
- `cur_have[a[2]]` and `cur_have[a[4]]` are already set to 0 because `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]` and `cur_mex` is greater than both `a[2]` and `a[4]`.
- For any other `a[i]` where `i` is within the range of the array, `cur_have[a[i]]` will be decremented by 1.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact state of `cur_have`. However, we know that `cur_have[a[0]]` is already 0, and `cur_have[a[2]]` and `cur_have[a[4]]` are also 0. For other elements, `cur_have[a[i]]` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration.

Given that `i` starts from 1, the first iteration will decrement `cur_have[a[1]]` by 1, the second iteration will decrement `cur_have[a[2]]` (which is already 0), and so on.

Therefore, the output state is:

- `cur_have[a[0]]` is 0 (decreased by 1 from the initial state).
- `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0 (unchanged).
- `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0 (unchanged).
- For other `a[i]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other i**.
