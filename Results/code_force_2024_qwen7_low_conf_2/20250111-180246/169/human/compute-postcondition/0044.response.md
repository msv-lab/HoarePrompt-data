Let's analyze the given conditions and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial Conditions
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
- If `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
- `i` is 4
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while another_have[another_mex]:`

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.
2. **Identify Relevant Variables**: The key variable here is `another_have[another_mex]`.
3. **Determine Necessary Adjustment**: For the loop to execute at least once, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. Given the information, we know that `another_have` has been initialized with specific values (`another_have[a[2]]` and `another_have[a[4]]` set to 1). This means `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]` (since these are the only indices that have a value of 1 in `another_have`).

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes at least once, `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`, and `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. Since `another_mex` is defined as `a[2] + k`, and both `a[2]` and `a[4]` are explicitly set to 1 in `another_have`, the only way to guarantee that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero is to ensure that `another_mex` matches one of these values.

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a` and if `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1, `i` is 4, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1, and `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`**.
