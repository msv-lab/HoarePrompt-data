Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
   - `a` is an array of length `n`.
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`.
   - `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`.
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.
   - `another_mex = a[2] + k + 2`.
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1.
   - `i = 4`.
   - `cur_mex \neq another_mex`.
   - `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1.
   - `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]` and `another_have[another_mex]` must be true.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `another_mex += 1` increments the value of `another_mex` by 1.

Since `another_mex` was initially set to `a[2] + k + 2`, after incrementing it by 1, its new value will be `a[2] + k + 3`.

**Output State**: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is an array of length `n`; `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`; `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`; `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex = a[2] + k + 3`; `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1; `i = 4`; `cur_mex \neq another_mex`; `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]` and `another_have[another_mex]` must be true.**
