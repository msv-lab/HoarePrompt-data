To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and analyze the conditions under which the loop continues.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is an array of length `n`.
- `cur_mex` is 1.
- `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as `cur_have[cur_mex]` is true. 

### Current State:
- `cur_mex` is 1.
- `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `cur_have[cur_mex]`. Since `cur_mex` is 1, the condition simplifies to `cur_have[1]`.
2. **Initial Condition**: We know `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero, but this doesn't directly affect `cur_have[1]`.

For the loop to continue executing one more time, `cur_have[1]` must be true. Since `cur_have[0]` is non-zero (which means `cur_have[0]` is either 1 or a non-zero integer), it does not constrain `cur_have[1]` in any way.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `cur_have[1]` is true.

### Adjusted State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is 1, `cur_have[1]` must be true**

This ensures that the loop condition `cur_have[cur_mex]` (which is `cur_have[1]`) evaluates to true, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
