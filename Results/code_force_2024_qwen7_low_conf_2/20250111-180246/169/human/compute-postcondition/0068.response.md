Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is 0
- `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0
- `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0
- `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`
- `another_mex` is an index that starts from an initial value (let's assume it starts from 0 without loss of generality)

### Loop Analysis:
The loop runs as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop increments `another_mex` by 1.

### Output States after a Few Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `another_have[another_mex]` is 0 (since `another_mex` was initially 0 and it is incremented by 1)
  - `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero
  - `another_mex` is incremented by 1

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `another_have[another_mex]` is 0 (since `another_mex` is now 1 and it is incremented by 1)
  - `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero
  - `another_mex` is incremented by 1

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `another_mex` is `initial_value + 1` (assuming initial_value is 0, so `another_mex` is 3)

### General Pattern:
- After `k` iterations, `another_mex` will be `k + initial_value`
- Since `another_have[another_mex]` becomes 0 after each iteration, eventually, there will be no non-zero values left in `another_have[]` because all elements will have been incremented by `another_mex`.

### Final State:
- The loop will continue until all values in `another_have[]` become zero. This means `another_mex` will be incremented until it reaches the length of the array `another_have[]`.
- Once the loop terminates, `another_mex` will be equal to the length of `another_have[]` (let's denote this length as `N`).

### Output State:
- All values in `another_have[]` will be zero.
- `another_mex` will be `N` (the length of `another_have[]`).
- The values of `cur_have[]` and `another_have[a[i]]` will remain unchanged except for the decrement and increment operations that were performed during the loop.

**Output State:**
```
Output State: **all `another_have[a[i]]` are 0, `another_mex` is the length of `another_have[]`, `cur_have[a[i]]` retains its values from the initial state except for the decrement operations, and `another_have[another_mex]` is 0.**
