Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The current state at the end of the previous iteration is that `mex` (minimum excluded) has been increased by 1.
- The loop condition is `while mex in num_set:`.

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `mex` is present in the `num_set`.
2. **Current State**: After the previous iteration, `mex` has been increased by 1. This means `mex` was in `num_set` during the previous iteration, and now `mex + 1` might be checked in the next iteration.
3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `mex + 1` must be present in `num_set`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `mex + 1` is present in `num_set`.

### Updated State
State: **`mex` is increased by 1 and `mex + 1` must be in `num_set`**

This ensures that the loop condition `mex in num_set` will be true for the next iteration.
