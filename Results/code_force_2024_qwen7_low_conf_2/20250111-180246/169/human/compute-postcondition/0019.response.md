`another_have` is initialized as an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros. This means each element in `another_have` will be set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have`, and `another_mex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have` remains unchanged from its last state during the loop execution, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**
