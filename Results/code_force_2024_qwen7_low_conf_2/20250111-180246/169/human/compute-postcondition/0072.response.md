`i` is incremented by 2, making it 3. `n` is not given a specific value in the code snippet, so it retains its initial state. The print statement outputs the value of `i + 2` (which is 3) concatenated with the string ' ' and the value of `n`. Since `n` is not reassigned, its value remains unchanged. The console output is '1 2', but this does not affect the variable states.

Output State: **`cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, `i` is 3, `n` is '2'**
