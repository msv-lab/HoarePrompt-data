The value of `cur_mex` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `cur_mex` is 1, while `t`, `n`, `a`, `cur_have[0]` retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is 1, `cur_have[0]` must be non-zero**
