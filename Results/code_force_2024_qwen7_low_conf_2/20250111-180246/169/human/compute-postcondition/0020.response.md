According to the provided for loop, the loop can execute if the variable `i` and the variable `n` meet certain conditions. Specifically, the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
- `cur_have` remains unchanged from its last state during the loop execution
- `another_mex` is 0
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros

The key states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- The value of `i` should start from 0 (the initial value of the loop counter).
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to start (since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have` remains unchanged from its last state during the loop execution, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
