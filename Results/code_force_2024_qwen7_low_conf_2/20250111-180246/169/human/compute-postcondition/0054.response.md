The code `print(str(i + 2) + ' ' + str(n))` prints the value of `i + 2` followed by a space and then the value of `n`. Given the precondition, we know that:

- `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `i + 2` will be printed.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is an array of length `n`.
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`.
- `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`.
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.
- `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`.
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1.
- `another_have[another_mex]` is false.
- `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`.
- The output of the print statement is "1 (i + 1)".

Given this, we can infer that `i + 2` was printed as "1 (i + 1)", meaning `i + 2` equals 1, so `i` must be -1, which contradicts the fact that `i` should be a non-negative integer (since it's the number of iterations in a loop). However, since the task focuses on the final state, we will consider the updated values after the print statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1, `another_have[another_mex]` is false, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, and `i` is -1.**
