The code `print(2)` simply prints the integer `2`. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 2, and `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex**.
