Functionality: **The function processes an array `a` of integers and determines if there are two indices `i` and `j` (where `i < j`) such that swapping the elements at these indices would result in the smallest missing positive integer (`cur_mex`) becoming equal to the next integer after the highest element in the array (`another_mex`). If such indices exist, the function prints their positions and returns `None`. If no such indices exist, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the internal state variables `cur_mex` and `another_mex` based on the analysis of the array `a`.**
