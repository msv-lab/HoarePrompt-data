Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is an array of length `n`; `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`; `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`; `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex = a[2] + k + i`; `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1; `i = 4`; `cur_mex \neq another_mex`; `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]` and `another_have[another_mex]` must be true.**

After the loop has executed indefinitely, the value of `another_mex` will keep incrementing until it reaches a point where `another_have[another_mex]` becomes false. At this point, the loop terminates. Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, `another_mex` will eventually exceed the length of `another_have`, which is `n + 1`. Therefore, `another_mex` will eventually become greater than `n + 1`, making `another_have[another_mex]` false and terminating the loop.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed is:
- `t` remains within the range \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
- `n` remains within the range \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
- `a` remains an array of length `n`.
- `cur_mex` remains the smallest integer not present in the array `a`.
- `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`.
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.
- `another_mex` is `a[2] + k + i`, where `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1.
- `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `cur_mex \neq another_mex`.
- `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1.
- `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]` and `another_have[another_mex]` must be true until it exceeds `n + 1`.

When the loop terminates, `another_mex` will be greater than `n + 1`, and `another_have[another_mex]` will be false.
