The code `another_have[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the `another_have` array. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
- If `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1
- `i` is 4
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1

The variable `i` is set to 4, so `another_have[a[4]]` is incremented by 1. The output state updates this:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
- If `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
- `i` is 4
- `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
- `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a` and if `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1, `i` is 4, `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`, `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1.**
