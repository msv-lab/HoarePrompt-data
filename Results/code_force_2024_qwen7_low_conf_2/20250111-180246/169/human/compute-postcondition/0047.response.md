Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `a` is an array of length `n`
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
   - If `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` is `a[2] + k + 1`
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
   - `i` is 4
   - `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
   - `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   another_mex += 1
   ```

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `another_mex` is incremented by 1.

4. **Updated Values:**
   - Since `another_mex` was originally defined as `a[2] + k + 1`, after adding 1, `another_mex` becomes `a[2] + k + 2`.
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

5. **Output State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `a` is an array of length `n`
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
   - If `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` is `a[2] + k + 2`
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
   - `i` is 4
   - `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`
   - `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `a` is an array of length `n`; `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`; if `cur_have[a[4]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[4]` holds true, then `cur_mex` equals `a[4]`; `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` is `a[2] + k + 2`; `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1; `i` is 4; `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`; `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]`**
