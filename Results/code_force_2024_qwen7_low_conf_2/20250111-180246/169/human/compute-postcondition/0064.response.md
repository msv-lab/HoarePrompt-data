Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `another_have[another_mex]`. For the loop to continue, this condition must be true.

2. **Current State Analysis:**
   - `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero.
   - `another_mex` is incremented by 1 in the loop body (as per the given information).

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex + 1]` must be non-zero. This means that `another_mex` must be such that `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `another_mex` is adjusted to point to the next non-zero entry in `another_have`.
   - Other states (`cur_have[a[0]]`, `cur_have[a[2]]`, `cur_have[a[4]]`, etc.) do not affect the loop condition directly and do not need to be changed for the loop to continue.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero.

**State:**
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is 0,
- `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0,
- `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0,
- `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`,
- `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`,
- `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero,
- `another_mex` must be incremented by 1 and `another_have[another_mex + 1]` must be non-zero.

State: **`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero, and `another_mex` must be incremented by 1 and `another_have[another_mex + 1]` must be non-zero.**
