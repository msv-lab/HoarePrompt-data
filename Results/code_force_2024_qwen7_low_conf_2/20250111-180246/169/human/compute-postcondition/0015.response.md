To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement.

Given:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is 2
- `cur_have[1]` must be true

Loop condition:
```
while cur_have[cur_mex]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop continues as long as `cur_have[cur_mex]` is true. Given that `cur_mex` is 2, the loop condition simplifies to:
```
while cur_have[2]:
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `cur_have[2]` must be true for the loop to continue. For the loop to execute one more time, `cur_have[2]` must remain true.

No other states (such as `t`, `n`, or `a`) directly influence the loop condition based on the provided information. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for these states.

So, the state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute one more time is `cur_have[2]` must remain true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is 2, `cur_have[2]` must be true**
