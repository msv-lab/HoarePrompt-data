The code initializes `mex` to 0. The values of `arr` and `num_set` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `mex`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`; `mex` is 0**
