The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The constraints and relationships provided are related to the variables inside the function, but not to the function itself.

Based on the output cases provided:

- Case_1: The function returns `None`.
- Case_2: The function returns `None`.
- Case_3: The function returns `cur_mex` which is equal to `another_mex`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to execute some operations within its body and return either `None` or `cur_mex` which equals `another_mex`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns `None` in two cases, and in the third case, it returns `cur_mex` which is equal to `another_mex`.**
