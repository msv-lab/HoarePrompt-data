To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider the initial conditions and how they change with each iteration. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
   - `a` is an array of length `n`
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
   - `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
   - `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed
   - `cur_mex \neq another_mex`
   - `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_have[another_mex]` is false
   - `cur_mex \neq another_mex`

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element of the array `a` using the index `i`.
   - After the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `cur_mex \neq another_mex` remains unchanged as long as it holds true.
   - The arrays `cur_have` and `another_have` do not change within the loop body (as per the given information), so their values remain the same.
   - The value of `a[i]` is not specified to change in the loop body, so `a[i]` remains the same for the next iteration.
   - The value of `cur_mex` is only updated based on the elements of `a`, but since no new information about `cur_mex` is given, we assume it remains unchanged unless updated inside the loop, which is not mentioned here.
   - The value of `another_mex` is not specified to change, so it remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)
- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- `a` is an array of length `n`
- `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
- `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`
- `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`
- `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
- `i` is incremented by 1 from its current value
- `cur_mex \neq another_mex`
- `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1
- `another_have[another_mex]` is false
- `cur_mex \neq another_mex`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1, `cur_mex \neq another_mex`, `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1, `another_have[another_mex]` is false, `cur_mex \neq another_mex**.
