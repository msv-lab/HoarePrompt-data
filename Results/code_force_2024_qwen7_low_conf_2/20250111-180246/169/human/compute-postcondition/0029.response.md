Step-by-step analysis of the code:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `a` is an array of length `n`
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` is `a[2] + 1` and must be such that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1
   - `i` is 2
   - If `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `another_mex += 1`

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `another_mex` is incremented by 1.
   - No other variables are affected.

4. **Updated Values**:
   - `another_mex` becomes `a[2] + 2` (since `another_mex` was originally `a[2] + 1`).
   - The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + 2` and must be such that `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 2, and if `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`.**
