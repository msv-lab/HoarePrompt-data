The code snippet `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` to the console. This does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have` reflects the count of each element in `a`, `another_mex` is the next integer after the highest element in `a` where `another_have[another_mex]` is zero, `another_have` reflects the count of each element in `a` plus one extra count for `another_mex`, and `-1` is printed to the console.**
