The code updates `cur_mex` to be equal to `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, this means `cur_mex` is updated to `a[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a` and now equals `a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 4, and `cur_mex` is not equal to `another_mex`. `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1.**
