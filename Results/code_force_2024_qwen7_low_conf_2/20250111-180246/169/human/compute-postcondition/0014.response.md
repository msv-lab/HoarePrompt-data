`cur_mex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cur_mex` was 1, so after the increment, `cur_mex` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is 2, `cur_have[1]` must be true**
