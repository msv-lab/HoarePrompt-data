Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - `a` is an array of length `n`
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` is `a[2] + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1
   - `i` is 3
   - `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(str(i + 2) + ' ' + str(n))
   ```

3. Let's analyze the impact of this code:
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - The expression `i + 2` evaluates to 5.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

4. The code prints the string "5 n" (with `n` as the actual value of `n`).

Since the code only prints the values of `i + 2` and `n`, and does not affect any other variables, the output state will only include the updated values of `i + 2` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop has executed, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 5, and `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex**.
