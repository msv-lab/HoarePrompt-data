To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition that controls the loop: `another_have[another_mex]`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is non-zero.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `another_have[another_mex]` is 0, and `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero. This means `another_mex` is pointing to an index where `another_have` is zero, which causes the loop to terminate.

3. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `another_have[another_mex]` must be non-zero. Given that `another_have[another_mex]` is 0 now, we need to ensure that `another_mex` points to an index where `another_have` is non-zero.

4. **Adjustment Needed**: Since `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero, the next value that `another_mex` should point to in the next iteration would be `another_mex + 1`. However, since the loop condition is checked only when `another_mex` is incremented, we need to ensure that `another_mex` is incremented to point to the non-zero value.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `another_mex` must be incremented by 1 to point to the next non-zero index in `another_have`.

**State:**
**`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`, `another_have[another_mex]` is 0, `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero, `another_mex` must be incremented by 1**
