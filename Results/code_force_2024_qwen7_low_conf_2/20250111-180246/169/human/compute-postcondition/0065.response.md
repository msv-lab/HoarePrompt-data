`another_mex` is incremented by 1. Since `another_mex` was previously incremented and had a non-zero value in `another_have`, it now points to the next value. The `another_have` dictionary will have its entry for `another_mex` set to 0, and the entry for `another_mex + 1` will remain non-zero. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`, `another_have[another_mex]` is 0, `another_have[another_mex + 1]` is non-zero, `another_mex` is incremented by 1**
