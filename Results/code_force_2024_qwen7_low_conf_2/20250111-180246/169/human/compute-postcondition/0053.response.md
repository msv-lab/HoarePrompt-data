Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
   - `a` is an array of length `n`
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`
   - `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1
   - `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed
   - `cur_mex \neq another_mex`
   - `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1
   - `another_have[another_mex]` is false
   - `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   print('1 ' + str(i + 1))
   ```

   This line prints a string that includes the value of `i` incremented by 1. However, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `cur_mex`, `cur_have`, `another_mex`, `another_have`, and `cur_have` remain unchanged.

3. The output of the print statement is "1 (i + 1)" where `i` is the current value of the iteration count.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we know it has been incremented by the loop or previous operations, but we do not know its exact value before this print statement.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1, `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `cur_mex \neq another_mex`, `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1, `another_have[another_mex]` is false, `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, and the output of the print statement is "1 (i + 1)".**
