Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)
- \( a \) is an array of length \( n \)
- \( cur\_mex \) is the smallest integer not present in the array \( a \)
- If \( cur\_have[a[4]] == 0 \) and \( cur\_mex > a[4] \) holds true, then \( cur\_mex = a[4] \)
- \( cur\_have[a[0]] \) is decreased by 1
- \( another\_mex = a[2] + k + 2 \)
- \( another\_have \) is an array of length \( n + 1 \) with \( another\_have[a[2]] \) being 1 and \( another\_have[a[4]] \) being 1
- \( i = 4 \)
- \( cur\_mex \neq another\_mex \)
- \( cur\_have[a[3]] \) is decreased by 1
- \( another\_mex \) must be either \( a[2] \) or \( a[4] \)

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while another_have[another_mex]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is true. This means we need to ensure that `another_have[another_mex]` remains true for the loop to execute one more time.

### Current State:
From the given information:
- \( another\_have[a[2]] = 1 \)
- \( another\_have[a[4]] = 1 \)

Since `another_mex` can only be \( a[2] \) or \( a[4] \), we need to ensure that `another_have[another_mex]` remains true for the loop to continue.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Check the current value of `another_mex`:**
   - If `another_mex` is \( a[2] \), then `another_have[a[2]]` must remain 1.
   - If `another_mex` is \( a[4] \), then `another_have[a[4]]` must remain 1.

Since both conditions are already met initially, no adjustments are necessary for these values to remain true.

2. **No other state changes are required:**
   - The loop condition depends solely on `another_have[another_mex]`.
   - Other states (like `t`, `n`, `a`, etc.) do not affect the loop continuation directly based on the given information.

### Final Output:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex = a[2] + k + 2`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1, `i = 4`, `cur_mex \neq another_mex`, `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` must be either `a[2]` or `a[4]` and `another_have[another_mex]` must be true.**

This ensures that the loop condition `while another_have[another_mex]` remains true for the next iteration.
