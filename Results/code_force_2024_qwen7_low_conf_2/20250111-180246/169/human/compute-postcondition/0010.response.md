The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1] for some integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the length of the list is n. The function returns the smallest non-negative integer not in the set 'num_set', which is derived from the elements of `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set formed by the elements of `arr`.
