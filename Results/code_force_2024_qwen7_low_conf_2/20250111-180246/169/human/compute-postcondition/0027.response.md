`another_mex` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `another_mex` was equal to `a[2]`. After incrementing `another_mex` by 1, its new value is `a[2] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2] + 1`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 2, and if `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`. Otherwise, no change to `cur_mex`.**
