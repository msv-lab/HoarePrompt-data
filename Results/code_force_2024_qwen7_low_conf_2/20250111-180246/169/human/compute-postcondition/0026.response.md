To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions:

1. The loop condition is `another_have[another_mex]`. This means the loop will continue as long as `another_have[another_mex]` is true (i.e., non-zero).

2. The current state of the variables:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is an array of length `n`.
   - `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`.
   - `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1.
   - `another_mex` is 0.
   - `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - If `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]; otherwise, no change to `cur_mex`.

Given these conditions, the only relevant part for the loop is `another_have[another_mex]`. Since `another_mex` is currently 0, we need to check `another_have[0]`. 

The current state of `another_have` is:
- `another_have[a[2]]` is 1.
- All other elements of `another_have` are assumed to be 0 (since no other values are specified).

For the loop to execute at least once, `another_have[0]` must be non-zero. In this case, `another_have[0]` is 0.

To make `another_have[0]` non-zero, we need to adjust the state so that `another_mex` is changed to a value where `another_have` is 1. Since `another_have[a[2]]` is 1, we need `another_mex` to be set to `a[2]`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `another_mex` being `a[2]`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is `a[2]`, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1, `i` is 2, and if `cur_have[a[2]] == 0 and cur_mex > a[2]`, then `cur_mex` is updated to `a[2]`. Otherwise, no change to `cur_mex`.**
