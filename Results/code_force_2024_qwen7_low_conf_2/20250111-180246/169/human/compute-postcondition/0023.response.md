The code `cur_mex = a[i]` updates the value of `cur_mex` to be equal to `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this means `cur_mex` is now set to `a[2]`. 

The initial conditions also include that `cur_mex` was previously the smallest integer not present in the array `a`, and `cur_have[a[1]]` was decreased by 1, but these conditions are not directly impacted by the assignment.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `cur_mex` is now `a[2]`
- `cur_have[a[1]]` is already updated from its last state (decreased by 1)
- All other variables remain unchanged

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `a` is an array of length `n`, `cur_mex` is `a[2]`, `cur_have[a[1]]` is decreased by 1, `another_mex` is 0, `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, and no changes to other variables.**
