Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

### Given State
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1].
- `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`.
- `mex` is 0.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while mex in num_set:`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Condition**: The current value of `mex` is 0.
2. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, `mex` must be present in `num_set`.

Since `mex` is initially 0, we need to check if 0 is in `num_set`.

3. **Set Content**: `num_set` contains unique elements from `arr`. Since `arr` contains integers in the range [0, n-1], 0 could potentially be in `num_set` if 0 is an element of `arr`.

4. **Ensuring Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `mex` (which starts as 0) must be in `num_set`. Therefore, 0 must be present in `num_set`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to adjust the state such that 0 is in `num_set`.

### Final Answer
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` and must contain the element 0; `mex` is 0**
