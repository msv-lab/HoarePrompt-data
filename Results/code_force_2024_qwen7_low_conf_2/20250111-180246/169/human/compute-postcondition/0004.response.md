To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition under which the loop continues:

The loop condition is `while mex in num_set:`. This means that as long as `mex` is in `num_set`, the loop will continue to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]
- `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` and must contain the element 0
- `mex` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `mex` (which is currently 1) must be removed from `num_set` because `while mex in num_set:` checks if `mex` is in the set. Once `mex` is removed, the condition will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `mex` is no longer in `num_set`.

**State:**
**`arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr` and must contain the element 0; `mex` is not in `num_set`**
