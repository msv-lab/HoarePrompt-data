The code `print('1 ' + str(i + 1))` has no direct impact on the variables `cur_mex` and `another_mex`. However, it introduces a new variable `i` which is incremented by 1. Since `i` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be introduced by this line of code. The print statement also outputs the string '1 2' to the console.

Output State: **`cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`, the console outputs '1 2', `i` is 1**
