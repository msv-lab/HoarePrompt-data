The code `num_set = set(arr)` creates a set from the list `arr`. In the initial state, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]. After creating the set `num_set` from `arr`, the set will contain unique elements from `arr`. The length of `num_set` will be less than or equal to `n` because `arr` contains at most `n` unique integers.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, n-1]; `num_set` is a set containing unique elements from `arr`**
