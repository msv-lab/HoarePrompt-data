The code `another_have[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `another_have[a[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state where `cur_have[a[0]]`, `cur_have[a[2]]`, and `cur_have[a[4]]` are 0, and `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`, the value of `another_have[a[i]]` for each `i` will be incremented by 1. Since no specific values for `a[i]` are given, we cannot determine exact values for `another_have`, but we know it will be incremented by 1 for each corresponding `a[i]`.

The conditions involving `cur_mex` do not affect the increment operation on `another_have`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cur_have[a[0]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[2]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[4]]` is 0, `cur_have[a[i]]` is decremented by 1 for other `i`, `another_have[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i`**
