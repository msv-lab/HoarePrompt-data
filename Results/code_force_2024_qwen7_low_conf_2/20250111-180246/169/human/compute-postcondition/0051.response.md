Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \); `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^5 \); `a` is an array of length `n`; `cur_mex` is the smallest integer not present in the array `a`; `cur_have[a[4]] == 0` and `cur_mex > a[4]` implies `cur_mex = a[4]`; `cur_have[a[0]]` is decreased by 1; `another_mex` is greater than `n + 1`; `another_have` is an array of length `n + 1` with `another_have[a[2]]` being 1 and `another_have[a[4]]` being 1; `i` is the number of iterations the loop has executed; `cur_mex \neq another_mex`; `cur_have[a[3]]` is decreased by 1; `another_have[another_mex]` is false; `cur_mex` is equal to `another_mex`***
