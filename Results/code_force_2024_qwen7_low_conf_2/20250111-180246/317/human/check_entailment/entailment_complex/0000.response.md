Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the string `s` contains no '0's by returning `n`.
   - It also correctly identifies the largest divisor of the count of '0's within the range `[1, n]`. This divisor represents the maximum value of `k` for which we can invert substrings to turn all characters into '1's.
   - However, there is a potential issue if the count of '0's is 0, in which case the function should return `n` directly without entering the loop, as no operation is needed.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads and processes `t` test cases efficiently using a single read operation for input.
   - It correctly passes the parameters `n` and `s` to `func_1` and collects the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case as expected.
   - The function handles the input constraints correctly, ensuring that `t` and `n` are within their specified ranges.

Given the problem statement and the analysis above, both functions together ensure that the program meets the requirements. The program correctly identifies the maximum value of `k` for each test case, and it processes multiple test cases efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
