Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum value of `k` such that all zeros in the string `s` can be grouped into segments of length `k` or less, which can then be inverted to turn all characters into '1'.
   - It first checks if there are no zeros (`zero_count == 0`), in which case it returns `n` (since the string is already all '1's).
   - If there are zeros, it iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to `n`, checking if the number of zeros is divisible by `k`. The largest such `k` is returned.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases in a single line of input and processes them one by one.
   - The results are stored and printed at the end.

3. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The approach in `func_1` is logically sound. For all zeros to be converted to '1', they must be grouped in such a way that their total count is divisible by some segment size `k`. The largest such `k` is the answer.
   - The implementation in `func_2` is also correct as it properly handles the input and output format specified in the problem statement.

Given that both functions are logically sound and correctly implement the required logic, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
