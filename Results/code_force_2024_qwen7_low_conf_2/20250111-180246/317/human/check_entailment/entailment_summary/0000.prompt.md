You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if zero_count == 0:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
    return max_k
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, and `s`, a string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1' with length `n`. 

- If the binary string `s` contains no '0's, the function returns `n`, which is the length of the string `s`.
- Otherwise, the function calculates the largest integer `max_k` such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and the count of '0's in `s` (`zero_count`) is divisible by `max_k`. The function then returns this `max_k`.

The function ensures that if `s` contains '0's, it finds and returns the largest divisor of the count of '0's within the range `[1, n]`. If `s` contains no '0's, it simply returns the length of the string `s`.

Edge cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function would incorrectly attempt to calculate `zero_count` using `s.count('0')`, leading to a `ValueError`. This should be handled by checking if `s` is non-empty before proceeding with the calculation.
- If `s` consists entirely of '1's, the function will correctly return `n` since `zero_count` will be 0, satisfying the condition for returning `n`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it either returns `n` (if `s` contains no '0's) or the largest integer `max_k` such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and `zero_count % max_k == 0` (if `s` contains '0's).
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes multiple binary strings `s` of lengths specified by `n`, up to 10,000 times, where each `s` is read from standard input along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, s)` and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one. The function ensures that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and each `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will raise an error. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` is an empty list, and `index` is set to \(1 + 2 \times t\), reflecting the position in the input data after processing all test cases.
