Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function correctly handles the scenario where the string `s` has no '0's by returning the length `n` of the string.
   - It iterates through all possible values of `k` from 1 to `n` and checks if the count of '0's in `s` (`zero_count`) is divisible by `k`. If so, it updates `max_k` to the current `k`.
   - This logic ensures that `max_k` is the largest integer such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and `zero_count % max_k == 0`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where `s` is empty by attempting to calculate `zero_count`, which would raise a `ValueError`. However, this edge case is not explicitly handled in the function itself. In practice, this situation should be avoided by ensuring `s` is non-empty before calling `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, splitting it into a list `data`.
   - It processes each test case by extracting `n` and `s` from the input, then calling `func_1(n, s)` to get the result.
   - The results are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end.
   - The function ensures that the number of test cases `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and the length of each string `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).

4. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `k` for each test case.
   - It processes all test cases efficiently by reading input in bulk and splitting it appropriately.
   - The final output matches the expected format and values.

Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program is designed to correctly solve the problem statement. Both functions work together to process multiple test cases and find the required maximum `k` for each case.

Correctness: **True**
