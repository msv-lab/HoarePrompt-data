### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly calculates the maximum value of `k` such that all zeros in the string `s` can be grouped into segments of length `k` or less, which can then be inverted to turn all characters into '1'. The logic is sound:
     - If there are no zeros (`zero_count == 0`), it returns `n` because the string is already all '1's.
     - If there are zeros, it iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to `n`, checking if the number of zeros is divisible by `k`. The largest such `k` is returned.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases appropriately, such as when there are no zeros in the string, ensuring the correct return value.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases in a single line of input and calls `func_1` for each test case. It handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement:
     - It reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
     - It splits the input into individual components (test cases, lengths, and strings).
     - It iterates over the test cases, calling `func_1` for each, and collects the results.
     - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function correctly manages the parsing and processing of multiple test cases, including handling the large input size constraints.

3. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - **Overall Logic**: Both functions are logically sound and correctly implement the required logic. The approach in `func_1` ensures that all zeros can be grouped into segments whose sizes are divisors of the zero count, and the implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of both functions and their logic, the program is indeed correct. The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
