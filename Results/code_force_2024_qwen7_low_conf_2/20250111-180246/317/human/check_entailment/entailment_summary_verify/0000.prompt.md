You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if zero_count == 0:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
    return max_k

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple binary strings `s` of lengths specified by `n`, up to 10,000 times, where each `s` is read from standard input along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, s)` and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one. The function ensures that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and each `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will raise an error. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` is an empty list, and `index` is set to \(1 + 2 \times t\), reflecting the position in the input data after processing all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum value of `k` based on the count of '0's in the string, which is an incorrect approach. The solution requires considering the longest segment of consecutive '0's in the string, not just the total count of '0's.

For example, consider the input:
- `n = 5`
- `s = "10001"`

The program would return `max_k = 4`, which is incorrect because we can only choose `k = 1` or `k = 2` to make all characters '1'. By choosing `k = 2` twice, we can convert all '0's to '1's:
1. Choose the substring from the 2nd to the 3rd character: `s = "11001"`
2. Choose the substring from the 3rd to the 4th character: `s = "11111"`

Therefore, the maximum value of `k` that works here is `2`, not `4`. The program fails to correctly identify the longest segment of consecutive '0's, which is necessary to determine the maximum `k`.
