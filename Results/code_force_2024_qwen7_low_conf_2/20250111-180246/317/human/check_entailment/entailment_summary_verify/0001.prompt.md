You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A binary string s of length n is given. A binary string is a string consisting
only of the characters '1' and '0'.

You can choose an integer k (1 \le k \le n ) and then apply the following
operation any number of times: choose k consecutive characters of the string
and invert them, i.e., replace all '0' with '1' and vice versa.

Using these operations, you need to make all the characters in the string
equal to '1'.

For example, if n=5 , s=00100 , you can choose k=3 and proceed as follows:

  * choose the substring from the 1 -st to the 3 -rd character and obtain s=\color{blue}{110}00 ; 
  * choose the substring from the 3 -rd to the 5 -th character and obtain s=11\color{blue}{111} ; 

Find the maximum value of k for which it is possible to make all the
characters in the string equal to '1' using the described operations. Note
that the number of operations required to achieve this is not important.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) —
the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n , consisting
of the characters '1' and '0'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values n^2 over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 25 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum integer k (1 \le k \le n ) for which it
is possible to obtain a string s consisting only of the characters '1' using
the described operations.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, s):
    zero_count = s.count('0')
    if zero_count == 0:
        return n
    max_k = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if zero_count % k == 0:
            max_k = k
    return max_k

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        s = data[index + 1]
        index += 2
        result = func_1(n, s)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple binary strings `s` of lengths specified by `n`, up to 10,000 times, where each `s` is read from standard input along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, s)` and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one. The function ensures that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and each `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will raise an error. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` is an empty list, and `index` is set to \(1 + 2 \times t\), reflecting the position in the input data after processing all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum value of `k` such that all zeros in the string `s` can be grouped into segments of length `k` or less, which can then be inverted to turn all characters into '1'.
   - It first checks if there are no zeros (`zero_count == 0`), in which case it returns `n` (since the string is already all '1's).
   - If there are zeros, it iterates through possible values of `k` from 1 to `n`, checking if the number of zeros is divisible by `k`. The largest such `k` is returned.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases in a single line of input and processes them one by one.
   - The results are stored and printed at the end.

3. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The approach in `func_1` is logically sound. For all zeros to be converted to '1', they must be grouped in such a way that their total count is divisible by some segment size `k`. The largest such `k` is the answer.
   - The implementation in `func_2` is also correct as it properly handles the input and output format specified in the problem statement.

Given that both functions are logically sound and correctly implement the required logic, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
