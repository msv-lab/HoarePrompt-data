Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem but does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum value of `k` based on the count of '0's in the string, which is an incorrect approach. The solution requires considering the longest segment of consecutive '0's in the string, not just the total count of '0's.

For example, consider the input:
- `n = 5`
- `s = "10001"`

The program would return `max_k = 4`, which is incorrect because we can only choose `k = 1` or `k = 2` to make all characters '1'. By choosing `k = 2` twice, we can convert all '0's to '1's:
1. Choose the substring from the 2nd to the 3rd character: `s = "11001"`
2. Choose the substring from the 3rd to the 4th character: `s = "11111"`

Therefore, the maximum value of `k` that works here is `2`, not `4`. The program fails to correctly identify the longest segment of consecutive '0's, which is necessary to determine the maximum `k`.
