`index` is incremented by 2, which means the value of `index` is updated. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2.
