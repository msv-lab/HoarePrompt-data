The code `print(res)` prints the value of `res`. Since `res` was not printed yet in the initial state, now it is printed. However, the value of `res` itself does not change due to this print statement. The variable `results` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`res` is printed, results is a list of remaining elements in `results` excluding the current `res`, and `results` must have at least one element.**
