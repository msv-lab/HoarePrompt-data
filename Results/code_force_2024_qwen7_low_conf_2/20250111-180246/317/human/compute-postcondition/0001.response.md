The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This affects the `data` variable, which is now assigned the list of split strings. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of '1' and '0', and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a line read from `sys.stdin.read`.**
