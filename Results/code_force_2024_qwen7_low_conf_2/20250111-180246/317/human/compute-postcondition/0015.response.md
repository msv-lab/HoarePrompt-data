`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `index` is increased by 2, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. The function `func_1(n, s)` is called, but the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified. Since the function's behavior is not defined, the only changes in the state are the updates to `index` and the assignment to `s`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and the value assigned to `s`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2`, `s` is `data[index + 1]`**
