According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is given to be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state provides that `t` is an integer within the specified range, but we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the conditions:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0.
- `n`, `s`, `data`, `index`, and `results` are provided with their respective values and do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0, which is inherently true given the constraints on `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
