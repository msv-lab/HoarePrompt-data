The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, the output state will include all the preconditions and the new condition about the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\); `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of '1' and '0'; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting a line read from `sys.stdin.read`, `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
