The code `print(res)` prints the value of `res`. The value of `res` is the next value in the `results` list, and this action does not change the value of `res` or any other variables. The `results` list is updated to exclude the current `res`, but since the code only prints `res` and does not reassign its value or modify the `results` list further, the output state remains the same as the initial state except for the action of printing `res`.

Output State: **`res` is printed, `results` is a list of remaining elements in `results` excluding the current `res`**
