According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is printed, and `results` contains the remaining elements in the list after excluding the current `res`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `res` has already been processed and removed from `results`, we need to ensure that there is at least one element left in `results` for the loop to continue.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `res` is printed.
   - `results` is a list of remaining elements in `results` excluding the current `res`.

2. **Next iteration requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `results` must contain at least one element.
   - After the previous iteration, `results` excludes the current `res`, so for the loop to continue, `results` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` still contains at least one element.

**State: **`res` is not printed yet, `results` is a list of remaining elements in `results` excluding the current `res`, and `results` must have at least one element.**
