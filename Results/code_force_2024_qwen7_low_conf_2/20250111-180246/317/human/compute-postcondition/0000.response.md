The code `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that when `input` is called later in the program, it will read the entire standard input as a single string instead of waiting for user input. However, this code does not directly assign a value to any variable. It only changes the behavior of the `input` function.

Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of '1' and '0'

The code does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. It only affects how `input` is used later in the program.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of '1' and '0', and `input` is now `sys.stdin.read`**.
