`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. The value of `n` remains `int(data[index])`, and the variables `data` and `index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `int(data[index])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 1]`**
