`results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `index`, or `result` directly. However, it adds `result` to the list `results`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**
