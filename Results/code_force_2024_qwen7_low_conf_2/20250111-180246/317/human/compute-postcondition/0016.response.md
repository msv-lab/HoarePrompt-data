The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. However, the variable `result` is not defined in the given initial state, nor is there any calculation or assignment involving `result` before this line. Therefore, the variable `result` remains undefined, and no changes are made to the values of `n`, `data`, `index`, or `s`.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2`, `s` is `data[index + 1]`, `result` is undefined, `results` is unchanged**
