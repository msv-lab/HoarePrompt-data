Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - The variable `res` has the same value as before the print statement was executed.
   - The value of `res` is printed at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Understand the Loop Structure:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list, assigning each element to `res` in turn.

3. **Determine the Change in `res`:**
   - Since `res` takes on the value of each element in `results` in each iteration, the value of `res` changes with each iteration.

4. **Determine the Condition for Continuing the Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

5. **Identify the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Let's denote the current value of `res` as `res_current`.
   - The value of `res_current` was printed at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - In the next iteration, `res` will take on the next value from the `results` list.
   - Therefore, the new value of `res` will be the next element in the `results` list after `res_current`.

7. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new value of `res` will be the next element in the `results` list.
   - The `results` list will be the same as before, but it will be one element shorter since `res` has already taken on the current value.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` has taken on the next value in the `results` list, and the `results` list itself has moved one step forward.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is the next value in the `results` list, `results` is a list of remaining elements in `results` excluding the current `res`**
