The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res`. It does not change the value of `res` or any other variables. The only impact is that the value of `res` is printed. Since no new value is assigned to `res`, its value remains unchanged.

Output State: **`res` has the same value as before the print statement was executed. The value of `res` is printed.**
