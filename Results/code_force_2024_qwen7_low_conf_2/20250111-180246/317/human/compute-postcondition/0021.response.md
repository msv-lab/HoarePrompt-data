`result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, s)`. The parameters `n` and `s` are passed to the function `func_1`. The value of `n` is `int(data[index])` and the value of `s` is `data[index + 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 6`, `s` is `data[index + 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `results` is unchanged**
