`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. The value of `index` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unknown. The value of `n` is derived from `data[index]` but does not change. The value of `t` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`; `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`**
