Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`
   - `data` is unchanged
   - `index` is `index + 2`
   - `s` is `data[index + 1]`
   - `result` is undefined
   - `results` is unchanged

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will iterate `t` times.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration:**
   - For each iteration of the loop, `index` will be incremented by 2 (as it was set to `index + 2` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - Since the loop uses `_` (a dummy variable), we don't need to consider the value of `n`, `s`, or `result` for the loop condition directly.
   - The key variables to track are `index` and `t`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `index` is `index + 2`.
   - To enter the next iteration, `index` needs to be incremented by 2 again.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `index` will be `(index + 2) + 2 = index + 4`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged (`int(data[index - 2])`).
   - `s` is still `data[index + 1]` from the previous iteration.
   - `result` remains undefined.
   - `results` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state:**
   - `n` is `int(data[index - 2])`
   - `data` is unchanged
   - `index` is `index + 4`
   - `s` is `data[index + 1]`
   - `result` is undefined
   - `results` is unchanged

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 4`, `s` is `data[index + 1]`, `result` is undefined, `results` is unchanged**
