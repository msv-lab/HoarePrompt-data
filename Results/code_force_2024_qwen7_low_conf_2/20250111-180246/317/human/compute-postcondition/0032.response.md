Functionality: **The function processes multiple binary strings `s` of lengths specified by `n`, up to 10,000 times, where each `s` is read from standard input along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, s)` and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one. The function ensures that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and each `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will raise an error. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` is an empty list, and `index` is set to \(1 + 2 \times t\), reflecting the position in the input data after processing all test cases.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input adheres to the specified formats and constraints without explicitly handling invalid inputs. For instance, if `t` exceeds 10,000 or `n` exceeds 5,000, or if `s` is not a valid binary string, the function may fail or produce unexpected results.
- There is no explicit handling of errors or exceptions if `func_1(n, s)` fails or returns an error condition. This could lead to incomplete or incorrect results in the `results` list.
