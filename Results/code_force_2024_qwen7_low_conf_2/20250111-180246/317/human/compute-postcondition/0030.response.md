Output State: **`res` is printed for all elements in `results`, `results` is an empty list, and `results` must have had at least `t` elements initially.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it.
- After printing each element, that element is removed from the `results` list.
- If the loop executes `t` times (which is the length of the `results` list), then `results` will be completely exhausted and become an empty list.
- The condition for the loop to execute at least once is that `results` must have at least one element. Since the loop removes one element per iteration, after `t` iterations, `results` will be empty.
- Therefore, the final state after all iterations is that `results` is an empty list and all elements in `results` have been printed.
