The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value from `data[index]` to the variable `n`. However, the initial state does not provide the specific value of `data[index]`, only that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since the exact value of `data[index]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`. But we know that `n` is converted from `data[index]` to an integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`**
