To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the following:

1. **Variable `res`**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

2. **List `results`**: The elements in `results` are derived from calling `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration where `n` is derived from `data[index - 2*i]` and `s` is `data[index - 2*i + 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to \(t\). Since `t` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the list `results` must have exactly `t` elements for the loop to execute.

3. **Initial conditions for `index` and `data`**: Given that `index = 1 + 2 * t`, this ensures that `index` is correctly set for accessing the elements in the `data` list. However, the presence of `data` is already ensured by the definition of `results`.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `t` must be at least 1 (which it is, given \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)).
- `results` must have exactly `t` elements.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `results` has the required number of elements.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `results` is a list containing exactly \(t\) elements, each element being the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for some `n` and `s` derived from `data`**.
