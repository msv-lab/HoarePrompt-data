The code updates the value of `n` by assigning it the value of `int(data[index])`. The previous value of `n` was `int(data[index - 2])`, and now it is updated to `int(data[index])`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 4`, `s` is `data[index + 1]`, `result` is undefined, `results` is unchanged**
