`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]`. The value of `index` is updated to `index + 4`, and `n` is unchanged as it was previously defined as `int(data[index])`. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is `int(data[index])`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 4`, `s` is `data[index + 1]`, `result` is undefined, `results` is unchanged**
