Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `index` is equal to \(1 + 2 \times t\), `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration where `n` is derived from `data[index - 2*i]` and `s` is `data[index - 2*i + 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to \(t\)**.

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- Each time the loop runs, it sets `n` to the integer value of `data[index]` and `s` to `data[index + 1]`.
- After processing each iteration, `index` is incremented by 2.
- Therefore, after `t` iterations, `index` will be at \(1 + 2 \times t\).
- The `results` list accumulates the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration, so `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, s)` for the corresponding iteration.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `t` is 0):
- `t` is 0.
- `index` remains 1.
- `results` remains an empty list.
