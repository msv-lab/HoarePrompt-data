Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is derived from `data[index]`.
   - `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`.
   - `index` is increased by 2.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element `result`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - Each iteration processes the values derived from `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]`.
   - After each iteration, `index` is incremented by 2.
   - `result` is computed using `func_1(n, s)`.
   - `result` is appended to the `results` list.

4. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `index` is increased by 2 after each iteration, for the next iteration, `index` should be increased by another 2.
   - The new value of `n` will be `data[index]` (which is now two positions ahead in the list).
   - The new value of `s` will be `data[index + 1]` (which is also two positions ahead in the list).
   - `result` will be the return value of `func_1(new_n, new_s)`, where `new_n` and `new_s` are the updated values of `n` and `s`.
   - The `results` list will have one additional element added to it, making it `results.append(result)`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `t` remains the same as it is a fixed number of iterations.
   - `index` is increased by 2.
   - `n` is updated to `data[index]`.
   - `s` is updated to `data[index + 1]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`.
   - `results` has one additional element `result` appended to it.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `index` is increased by 2, `n` is derived from `data[index]`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**
