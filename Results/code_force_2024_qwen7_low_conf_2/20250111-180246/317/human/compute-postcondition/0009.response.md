The function `func_1(n, s)` is called with `n` and `s` as arguments. However, the actual implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. The variable `index` is increased by 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, s)`**
