The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, and `s`, a string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1' with length `n`. 

- If the binary string `s` contains no '0's, the function returns `n`, which is the length of the string `s`.
- Otherwise, the function calculates the largest integer `max_k` such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and the count of '0's in `s` (`zero_count`) is divisible by `max_k`. The function then returns this `max_k`.

The function ensures that if `s` contains '0's, it finds and returns the largest divisor of the count of '0's within the range `[1, n]`. If `s` contains no '0's, it simply returns the length of the string `s`.

Edge cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function would incorrectly attempt to calculate `zero_count` using `s.count('0')`, leading to a `ValueError`. This should be handled by checking if `s` is non-empty before proceeding with the calculation.
- If `s` consists entirely of '1's, the function will correctly return `n` since `zero_count` will be 0, satisfying the condition for returning `n`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it either returns `n` (if `s` contains no '0's) or the largest integer `max_k` such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and `zero_count % max_k == 0` (if `s` contains '0's).
