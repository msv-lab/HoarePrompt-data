    return max_k
    #`The program returns the largest integer max_k such that 1 ≤ max_k ≤ n and zero_count % max_k == 0, where zero_count is the count of '0's in binary string s and is not equal to 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the length of the binary string `s`, and `s`, a string consisting only of the characters '0' and '1' with length `n`. 

- If the binary string `s` contains no '0's, the function returns `n`, which is the length of the string `s`.
- Otherwise, the function calculates the largest integer `max_k` such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and the count of '0's in `s` (`zero_count`) is divisible by `max_k`. The function then returns this `max_k`.

The function ensures that if `s` contains '0's, it finds and returns the largest divisor of the count of '0's within the range `[1, n]`. If `s` contains no '0's, it simply returns the length of the string `s`.

Edge cases:
- If `s` is an empty string, the function would incorrectly attempt to calculate `zero_count` using `s.count('0')`, leading to a `ValueError`. This should be handled by checking if `s` is non-empty before proceeding with the calculation.
- If `s` consists entirely of '1's, the function will correctly return `n` since `zero_count` will be 0, satisfying the condition for returning `n`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the function concludes is that it either returns `n` (if `s` contains no '0's) or the largest integer `max_k` such that `1 ≤ max_k ≤ n` and `zero_count % max_k == 0` (if `s` contains '0's).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and s is a binary string of length n consisting only of '1' and '0'.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `index` is equal to \(1 + 2 \times t\), `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, s)` for each iteration where `n` is derived from `data[index - 2*i]` and `s` is `data[index - 2*i + 1]` for \(i\) from 1 to \(t\)
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `res` is printed for all elements in `results`, `results` is an empty list, and `results` must have had at least `t` elements initially.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple binary strings `s` of lengths specified by `n`, up to 10,000 times, where each `s` is read from standard input along with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, s)` and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one. The function ensures that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and each `n` is within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\). If any of these constraints are violated, the function will raise an error. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` is an empty list, and `index` is set to \(1 + 2 \times t\), reflecting the position in the input data after processing all test cases.
