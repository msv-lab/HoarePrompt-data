#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. However, the field configuration and game actions are provided as part of the problem description, and the output is generated based on the given input format. N and M are integers representing the dimensions of the field, P is the number of players per team (1 ≤ P ≤ 10), T is the number of steps in the game (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000), and the field is described by a series of characters representing the entities and their actions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a game scenario where players move on a grid and attempt to score goals by moving a quaffle (a game ball) into opposing team's goal. The function reads the initial field configuration, including the dimensions of the field (N and M), the number of players per team (P), the number of steps in the game (T), and the initial positions of players and the quaffle. It then iterates through each step of the game, updating the positions of the players based on the actions specified, and checks if the quaffle is moved into a goal. If a goal is scored, the scoring team's opponent scores a point, and the quaffle is reset to the center of the field. The function finally prints the final score of the game. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the quaffle starts outside the field or when invalid actions are provided. The function also handles the case where the quaffle is not found in the initial configuration, setting `quaffle_position` to `None`.
