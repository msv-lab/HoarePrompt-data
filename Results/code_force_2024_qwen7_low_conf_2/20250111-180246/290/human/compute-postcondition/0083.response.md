Postcondition: ***`j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', then `quaffle_position` is set to `(i, j)`. Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B', `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the numeric part of `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`. If the first character of `field[i][j]` is neither 'R' nor 'B', no changes are made to `team`, `number`, or `players`.***
