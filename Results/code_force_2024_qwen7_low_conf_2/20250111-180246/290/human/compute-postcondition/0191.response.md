Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` is `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`, otherwise it remains `None`, `quaffle_position` is unchanged, `blue_score` is unchanged, `red_score` is unchanged, and `ball` is now `action[2]`.**
