The code `players[team][number] = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the specified key in the `players` dictionary. Given the initial values, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, so `players[team][number]` will be updated to `(1, 0)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`team` is either 'R' or 'B'; `number` is the number of the player on team `team`; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; `quaffle_position` is the position of the quaffle (if any) or `None`; `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings; `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings; `players['R'][number]` is (1, 0); `players['B'][number]` is (1, 0)**
