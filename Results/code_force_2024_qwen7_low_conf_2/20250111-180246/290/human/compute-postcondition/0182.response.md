Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` is updated to `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'` and otherwise remains `None`, `quaffle_position` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `blue_score` and `red_score` are updated based on the conditions mentioned, `x` is the first element of `positions[entity]`, `y` is the second element of `positions[entity]`, if `command == 'R'`, `y` is increased by 1. If `command` is not `'R'`, the value of `ball` is updated to `action[2]` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`, if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, the string `'BLUE GOAL'` is printed if `cell == 'RG'`, otherwise the string 'RED GOAL' is printed.***
