Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `quaffle_position` is (1, 1) if `field[i][j]` was \('.Q'\), otherwise it remains (1, 0); `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings plus 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', and `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings plus 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG'; if `field[i][j]` was 'R', `players['R'][1]` is updated to (1, 0); if `field[i][j]` was 'B', `players['B'][1]` is updated to (1, 0); otherwise, the values of `quaffle_position`, `goals['RG']`, `goals['BG']`, and `players` remain unchanged.***
