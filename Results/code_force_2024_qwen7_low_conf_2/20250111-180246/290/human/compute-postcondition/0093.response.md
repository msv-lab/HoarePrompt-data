The code `quaffle_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it remains undefined. However, `j` is defined as `M + 1` and `M` is greater than 0, so `j` is `M + 1`.

The states of the other variables (`j` and `M`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`j` is `M + 1`, `M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is (i, M + 1)**
