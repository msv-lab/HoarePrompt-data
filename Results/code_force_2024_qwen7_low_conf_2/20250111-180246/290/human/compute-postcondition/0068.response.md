Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. `quaffle_position` is (1, 2) if `field[1][2]` was '.Q', otherwise it remains (1, 1). `goals['RG']` and `goals['BG']` are updated based on whether `field[1][2]` was 'RG' or 'BG'. If `field[1][2]` is in ['R', 'B', '.Q'], `players['R'][1]` or `players['B'][1]` or `players['Q'][1]` is updated to (1, 0) accordingly; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the state of all relevant variables (`quaffle_position`, `goals['RG']`, `goals['BG']`, and `players`) is correctly described based on the conditions and updates specified in the if and else parts.
