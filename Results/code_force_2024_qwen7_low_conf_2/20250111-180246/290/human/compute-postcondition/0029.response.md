Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is less than `M`. If `field[0][j]` is '.', the position of the quaffle is (0, j). If `field[0][j]` is in ['RG', 'BG'], the corresponding goals counter is incremented by 1. If `field[0][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', `team` is set to `field[0][j][0]`, `number` is set to `field[0][j][1]`, `i` is set to 0, and `players[team][number]` is set to `[0, j]`. If `field[0][j][0]` is neither 'R' nor 'B', no changes are made to the variables.***
