Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `quaffle_position` is (1, 1) if `field[i][j]` was \('.Q'\), otherwise it remains (1, 0). `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG'. If `field[i][j]` is in ['R', 'B', '.Q'], `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` or `players['Q'][1]` is updated to (1, 0) accordingly; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
