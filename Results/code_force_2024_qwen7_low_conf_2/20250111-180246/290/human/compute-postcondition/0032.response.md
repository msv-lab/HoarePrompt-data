The code snippet `goals[field[i][j]] += 1` increments the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` by 1. However, the initial values of `field[i][j]`, `goals`, and the exact value of `M` are not specified. Since `j` is less than `M`, `field[i][j]` must be an index used to access a key in the dictionary `goals`. The value of `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1, but its initial value is unknown. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `M`, `goals[field[i][j]]` is increased by 1**
