To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze how the variables change during each iteration. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `M-1`
   - `M` is greater than 0
   - If `field[i][j]` is '.Q', then `quaffle_position` is set to `(i, j)`
   - Otherwise, if `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1
   - If the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B', `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the numeric part of `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to `(i, j)`
   - If the first character of `field[i][j]` is neither 'R' nor 'B', no changes are made to `team`, `number`, or `players`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(M):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `M-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `M-1`.
   - For the next iteration to occur, `j` must be incremented by 1 and remain within the range `[0, M-1]`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `M-1 + 1 = M`.
   - The value of `M` remains unchanged as the loop continues.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - `j` will be `M` (since `M-1 + 1 = M`)
   - `M` remains greater than 0 (as long as the condition holds true)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is `M`, `M` is greater than 0**
