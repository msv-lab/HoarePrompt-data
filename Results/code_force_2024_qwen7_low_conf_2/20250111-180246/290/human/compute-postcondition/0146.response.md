The code updates the `scoring_team` based on whether `quaffle_position` is in `['BG']`. Since `quaffle_position` is either `((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1)` or the final position of the entity specified in `actions`, and `['BG']` is a list containing only the string `'BG'`, `quaffle_position` cannot be a string and thus cannot be in `['BG']`. Therefore, the condition `quaffle_position in ['BG']` evaluates to `False`. As a result, `scoring_team` is set to `'R'`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `quaffle_position` is either `((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1)` or the final position of the entity specified in `actions`; `goals['RG']` is the total count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the total count of 'BG' sightings; `players['R'][number]` is the final position of player 'R' with number `number` for all valid numbers; `players['B'][number]` is the final position of player 'B' with number `number` for all valid numbers; `actions` is not an empty list; `scoring_team` is `'R'`.**
