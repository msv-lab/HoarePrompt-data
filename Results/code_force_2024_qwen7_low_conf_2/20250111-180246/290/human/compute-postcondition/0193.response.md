Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` remains `None`, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged, `blue_score` remains unchanged, `red_score` remains unchanged, `cell` remains unchanged, `ball` remains unchanged. If `command == 'T'`, then no changes are made to the variables.***
