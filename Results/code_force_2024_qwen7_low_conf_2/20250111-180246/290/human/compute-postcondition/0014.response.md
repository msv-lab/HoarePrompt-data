`goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. The value of `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', so `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, the field at position `[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q', and the current value of `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` is 'RG', otherwise `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1.**
