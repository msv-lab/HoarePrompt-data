Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is less than `M`. If `field[0][j]` is in ['RG', 'BG'], then `goals[field[0][j]]` is incremented by 1. If `field[0][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `team` is the first element of `field[0][j]`, `number` is the second element of `field[0][j]`, `i` is 0, and `players[team][number]` is set to `[0, j]`. If `field[0][j][0]` is not 'R' or 'B', no changes are made to the variables.***
