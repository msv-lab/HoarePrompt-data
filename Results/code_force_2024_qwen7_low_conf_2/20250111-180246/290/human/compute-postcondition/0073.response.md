The variable `quaffle_position` is assigned the values `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the preconditions that `j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0, the value of `field[i][j]` is '.', and the value of `field[i][j]` is 'Q' are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0, the value of `field[i][j]` is '.', the value of `field[i][j]` is 'Q', `quaffle_position` is `(i, j)`.

Output State: **`j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0, the value of `field[i][j]` is '.', the value of `field[i][j]` is 'Q', `quaffle_position` is `(i, j)`**
