Postcondition: ***`action` is a string, `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` is updated based on the value of `action`. If `quaffle_position` is in `goals`, `score['R']` remains unchanged, `score['B']` is incremented by 1, and `opposite_team` is set to 'R'. `quaffle_position` is set to \((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1\). Otherwise, `quaffle_position` retains its initial value and no changes occur to `score` or `opposite_team`.*:*
