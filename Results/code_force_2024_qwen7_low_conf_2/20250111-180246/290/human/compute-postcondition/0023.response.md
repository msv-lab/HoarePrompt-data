The code assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. Given the initial values `i` is 0 and `j` must be less than `M`, the value of `quaffle_position` will be `(0, j)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` must be less than `M`; `quaffle_position` is (0, j)**
