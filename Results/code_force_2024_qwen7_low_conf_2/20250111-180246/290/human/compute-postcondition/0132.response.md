Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `quaffle_position` is ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1), `goals['RG']` is the total count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the total count of 'BG' sightings, `players['R'][number]` is the final position of player 'R' with number `number`, `players['B'][number]` is the final position of player 'B' with number `number` for all valid numbers, `actions` is not an empty list, if `quaffle_position` is in `goals`, `scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R', and `score['R']` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
