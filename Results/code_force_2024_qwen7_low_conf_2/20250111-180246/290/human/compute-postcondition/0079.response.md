`team` and `number` are assigned the values from `field[i][j]`. Given the precondition, `field[i][j]` starts as a string with the first character being either 'R' or 'B', and the rest of the string being a number. Therefore, `team` will be either 'R' or 'B', and `number` will be the numeric part of the string.

Output State: **`j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0, `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q', `field[i][j]` is not in ['RG', 'BG'], and the first character of `field[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B', `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the numeric part of `field[i][j]`**
