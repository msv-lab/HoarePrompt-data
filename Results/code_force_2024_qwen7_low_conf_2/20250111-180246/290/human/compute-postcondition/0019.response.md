Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, and the field at position `[i][j]` is not equal to 'RG' and not equal to 'BG'. If the first character of the field at position `[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` is (0, `j`). Otherwise, no change occurs.***
