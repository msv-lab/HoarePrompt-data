Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` is updated to `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'` and otherwise remains `None`, `quaffle_position` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `blue_score` and `red_score` are updated based on the conditions mentioned, the value of `ball` is updated to `action[2]` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`, if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, the string `'BLUE GOAL'` is printed if `cell == 'RG'`, otherwise the string 'RED GOAL' is printed. If `command == 'U'`, `x` is `positions[entity][0] - 1` and `y` is the second element of `positions[entity]`. If `command` is not in `'UDLR'`, `x` and `y` are updated according to the command: if `command` is 'D', `x` is incremented by 1; if `command` is 'L', `y` is decremented by 1; if `command` is 'R', `y` is incremented by 1.**
