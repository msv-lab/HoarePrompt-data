Postcondition: ***`action` is a string. If `action` is 'R', `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` is updated to the original first element of the tuple followed by the second element incremented by 1. If `action` is 'C', no change occurs. If `action` is 'T', `quaffle_position` is set to `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` and `players` and `entity` retain their initial values. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
