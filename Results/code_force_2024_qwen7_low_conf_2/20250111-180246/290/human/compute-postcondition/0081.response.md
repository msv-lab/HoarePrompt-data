Postcondition: ***`j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0, `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q', `field[i][j]` is not in ['RG', 'BG'], and the first character of `field[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B'. If the first character of `field[i][j]` is 'R' or 'B', `team` is either 'R' or 'B', `number` is the numeric part of `field[i][j]`, and `players[team][number]` is set to (i, j). If the first character of `field[i][j]` is neither 'R' nor 'B', no change is made to `team`, `number`, or `players`.***
