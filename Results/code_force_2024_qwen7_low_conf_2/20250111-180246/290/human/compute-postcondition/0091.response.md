Postcondition: ***`j` is `M`, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is either '.Q', 'RG', or 'BG', then:
- If `field[i][j]` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1.
- If `field[i][j]` is 'RG', `players['R'][number]` is set to `[i, j]`.
- If `field[i][j]` is 'BG', `players['B'][number]` is set to `[i, j]`.
Otherwise, `j` remains `M`, `team` remains `field[i][j][0]`, and `number` remains `field[i][j][1]`.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, including the specific conditions and the default case where `field[i][j]` does not match any special condition.
