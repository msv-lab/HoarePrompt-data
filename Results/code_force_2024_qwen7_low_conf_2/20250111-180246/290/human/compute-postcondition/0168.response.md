The code `print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')` prints a string which includes the value of `t` and the uppercased version of `opposite_team`. Since `opposite_team` is determined by the value of `scoring_team`, and `scoring_team` is `'R'` if `quaffle_position` is `'BG'` and `'B'` otherwise, we can determine `opposite_team` based on the value of `quaffle_position`.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `scoring_team` is `'R'`, then `opposite_team` is `'B'`.
- If `scoring_team` is `'B'`, then `opposite_team` is `'R'`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `quaffle_position` is `'BG'`, then `scoring_team` is `'R'` and `opposite_team` is `'B'`.
2. If `quaffle_position` is not `'BG'`, then `scoring_team` is `'B'` and `opposite_team` is `'R'`.

In both cases, the score of the `opposite_team` is incremented by 1. The print statement will output a string with `t` and the uppercased version of `opposite_team`.

Output State: **`t` is a string, `score['R']` is incremented by 1 if `quaffle_position` is 'BG', otherwise `score['B']` is incremented by 1, `opposite_team` is 'B' if `quaffle_position` is 'BG', otherwise 'R', `quaffle_position` retains its initial value.**
