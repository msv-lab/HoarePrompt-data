Postcondition: ***`j` is `M`, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', then `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains `M`, `team` remains `field[i][j][0]`, and `number` remains `field[i][j][1]`. If `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players[team][number]` is set to `[i, j]`.***
