Postcondition: ***`action` is a string, `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` is updated based on the value of `action`: if `action` is 'U', `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` is updated to `(players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0] - 1, players[entity[0]][entity[1]][1])`. If `action` is 'D', it is updated to (`players[entity[0]][entity[1]][0] + 1`, `players[entity[0]][entity[1]][1]`). If `action` is 'L', it is set to `(a, b-1)`. If `action` is 'R', it is updated to the original first element of the tuple followed by the second element incremented by 1. If `action` is 'C', no change occurs. If `action` is 'T', `quaffle_position` is set to `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` and `players` and `entity` retain their initial values. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
