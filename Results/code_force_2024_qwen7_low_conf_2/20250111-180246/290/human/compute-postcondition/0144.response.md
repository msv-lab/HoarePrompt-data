Postcondition: ***`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `quaffle_position` is either `((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1)` or the final position of the entity specified in `actions`; `goals['RG']` is the total count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the total count of 'BG' sightings; `players['R'][number]` is the final position of player 'R' with number `number` for all valid numbers; `players['B'][number]` is the final position of player 'B' with number `number` for all valid numbers; `actions` is not an empty list. If `action` is 'D', the quaffle position remains unchanged. If `action` is 'L', the y-coordinate of one specific player's position is decreased by 1. If `action` is 'R', the y-coordinate of the same player's position is incremented by 1. If `quaffle_position` is in `goals`, then `scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R', and `score['R']` is incremented by 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
