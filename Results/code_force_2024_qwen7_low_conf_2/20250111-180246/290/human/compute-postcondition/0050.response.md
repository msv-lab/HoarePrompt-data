Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `quaffle_position` is the position of the quaffle (if any) or `None`, `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings, `players['R'][number]` is the position of player 'R' with number `number`, `players['B'][number]` is the position of player 'B' with number `number`, for all valid numbers. Additionally, the field at position `[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B'. If the field at position `[i][j][0]` is 'R', then `players['R'][number]` is (1, 0). If the field at position `[i][j][0]` is 'B', then `players['B'][number]` is (1, 0).***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else cases, maintaining the original preconditions and updating the relevant variables according to the if condition.
