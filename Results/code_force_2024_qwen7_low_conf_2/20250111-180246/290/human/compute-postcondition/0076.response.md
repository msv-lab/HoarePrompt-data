`goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. Since `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` will be incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `M-1`, `M` is greater than 0, and `field[i][j]` is not equal to '.Q'. The current value of `field[i][j]` is either 'RG' or 'BG'; `goals['RG']` or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1.**
