State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The given for loop statement is `for j in range(M):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j < M`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `M` must be greater than 0. If `M` is 0 or negative, the loop body will not run even once.
3. The initial state provided is that `N` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0. These values do not directly affect the execution of the for loop based on `M`.

Therefore, to ensure the for loop can execute, the state must include `M` being greater than 0.
