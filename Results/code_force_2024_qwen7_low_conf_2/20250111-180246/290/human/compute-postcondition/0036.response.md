Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `M`. If `field[i][j]` is in ['RG', 'BG'], then `goals[field[i][j]]` is increased by 1. If `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `team` is `team_value` and `number` is `number_value`, and `players[team][number]` is (0, j). Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables.**
