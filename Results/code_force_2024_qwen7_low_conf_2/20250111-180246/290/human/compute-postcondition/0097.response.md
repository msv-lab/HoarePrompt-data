Postcondition: ***`j` is `M + 1`, `team` is the value at `field[i][M + 1][0]`, and `number` is the value at `field[i][M + 1][1]`. If `field[i][M + 1][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players[team][number]` is updated to `(i, M + 1)`. If `field[i][M + 1][0]` is not 'R' or 'B', no update is made to `players`.***
