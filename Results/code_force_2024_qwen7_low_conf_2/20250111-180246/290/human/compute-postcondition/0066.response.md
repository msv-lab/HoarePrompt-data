Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `quaffle_position` is (1, 0), `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings. If `field[i][j][0]` is 'R' or 'B', then either `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` or `players['Q'][1]` is updated to (1, 0); otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
