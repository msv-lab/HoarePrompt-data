`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`. The values of `N` and `M` are taken from the initial input, and `field` is a list of `N` sublists, each containing strings. The values of `N` and `M` and the structure of `field` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `N` and `M` are integers assigned from the input, `field` is a list of `N` sublists, each sublist is a list of strings obtained from an input.**
