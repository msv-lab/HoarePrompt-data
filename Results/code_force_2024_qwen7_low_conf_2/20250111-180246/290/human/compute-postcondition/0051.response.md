Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `quaffle_position` is the position of the quaffle (if any) or `None`, `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG', `players['R'][number]` is the position of player 'R' with number `number`, `players['B'][number]` is the position of player 'B' with number `number`, for all valid numbers. Additionally, if `field[i][j]` was in ['RG', 'BG'], the count of corresponding goals is incremented. Otherwise, the field at position `[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B', and if the field is 'R', `players['R'][number]` is set to (1, 0); if the field is 'B', `players['B'][number]` is set to (1, 0).***
