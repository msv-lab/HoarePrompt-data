The code `print(f"FINAL SCORE: {score['R']} {score['B']}")` prints the values of `score['R']` and `score['B']` in a formatted string. However, this code does not change any variable values; it only prints them. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`score['R']` is its original value, `score['B']` is its original value**
