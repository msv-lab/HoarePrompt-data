Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `j` is less than `M`, and `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B'. If `field[i][j][0]` is in ['R', 'B'], then the postcondition is such that `team` is `team_value` and `number` is `number_value`, and `players[team][number]` is (0, j). Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.**
