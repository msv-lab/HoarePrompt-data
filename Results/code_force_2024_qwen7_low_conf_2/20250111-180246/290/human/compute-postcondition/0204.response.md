Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` is either `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'` and otherwise remains `None`, `quaffle_position` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `blue_score` and `red_score` are updated based on the conditions mentioned, `cell` is the value of `field[x][y]`. If `cell == 'BG'`, `red_score` is incremented by 1, `quaffle_position` is updated to \((N - 1) // 2, (M - 1) // 2\), and if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, the appropriate goal message is printed. Otherwise, if `cell == 'BG'` is false, the existing conditions for updating `quaffle_carrier`, `quaffle_position`, `blue_score`, `red_score`, and `ball` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, the string `'BLUE GOAL'` is printed if `cell == 'RG'`, otherwise the string 'RED GOAL' is printed. Finally, `ball` is updated to `action[2]` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`.***
