Output State: **`blue_score` is `blue_score + 1 + 1`; `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0; `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`; `command` is `action[1]`; `quaffle_carrier` is `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'` and otherwise remains `None`; `quaffle_position` is updated based on the conditions mentioned; `red_score` remains unchanged; `cell` is the value of `field[x][y]`; if `quaffle_carrier` is `None` and `quaffle_position` is not `None`, the string `'BLUE GOAL'` is printed if `cell == 'RG'`, otherwise the string 'RED GOAL' is printed; the value of `ball` is updated to `action[2]` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`; `command in 'UDLR'` is checked; if `command in 'UDLR'`, `quaffle_position` does not change; `quaffle_carrier` is updated to `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'` and otherwise remains `None`; `x` is the first element of `quaffle_position`; `y` is the second element of `quaffle_position`; `positions[entity]` is updated to `(x, y)` if `command` is not in `'UDLR'`; if `command` is not in `'UDLR'`, `quaffle_carrier` is updated to `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'` and otherwise remains `None`; `quaffle_position` remains unchanged; `ball` is now `action[2]`; the string `f'{t} BLUE GOAL'` is printed.
