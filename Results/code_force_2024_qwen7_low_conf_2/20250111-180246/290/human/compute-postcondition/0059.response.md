Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `quaffle_position` is (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` is \('.Q'\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG', `players['R'][number]` is the position of player 'R' with number `number` updated to (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` was 'R', `players['B'][number]` is the position of player 'B' with number `number` updated to (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` was 'B', and `players['Q'][1]` is (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` is \('.Q'\), otherwise the values remain unchanged, where `team` is the first element of `field[i][j]` and `number` is the second element of `field[i][j]` if `field[i][j]` is in ['R', 'B', '.Q']***
