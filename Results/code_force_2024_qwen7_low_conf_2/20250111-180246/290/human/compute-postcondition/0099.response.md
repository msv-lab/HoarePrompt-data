Postcondition: **`j` is `M + 1`, `M` is greater than 0. If `field[i][j]` is '.', the function does nothing. If `field[i][j]` is in ['RG', 'BG'], then `goals[field[i][j]]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `team` is the value at `field[i][M + 1][0]`, `number` is the value at `field[i][M + 1][1]`. If `team` is either 'R' or 'B', then `players[team][number]` is updated to `(i, M + 1)`. If `team` is not 'R' or 'B', no update is made to `players`.**
