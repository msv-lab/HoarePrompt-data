The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the description, it processes an input that consists of a field represented by N lines, each containing M pairs of characters, where N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) and T lines describing actions performed by entities on the field.

The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned, but it presumably performs some operations based on the input field and the actions described.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process an input field consisting of N lines with M pairs of characters, along with T actions, where N and M are odd integers between 3 and 99, and T is an integer between 0 and 10000.

Functionality: **The function accepts an input field represented by N lines, each containing M pairs of characters, where N and M are odd integers between 3 and 99, and an integer T between 0 and 10000 representing actions.**
