Functionality: **The function processes a game field represented by N lines, each containing M pairs of characters, where N and M are odd integers between 3 and 99. It also takes an integer T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) representing actions performed on the field. The function updates the positions of entities on the field based on these actions, tracks the position of the Quaffle, and counts the number of goals scored by each team (Red and Blue). After processing all actions, the function prints the final score of the game.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the input from standard input and splits it into lines.
2. Extracts the dimensions N and M of the field from the first line.
3. Parses the remaining lines to create a 2D list representing the field, where each cell can contain a player, goal, or the Quaffle.
4. Reads the integer T, which represents the number of actions to be performed.
5. Initializes dictionaries and variables to track the positions of entities and scores.
6. Loops through each action, updating the positions of entities and the Quaffle based on the commands provided.
7. Checks for goals scored by either team and updates the scores accordingly.
8. Prints the final score of the game after all actions have been processed.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The code assumes that there is exactly one '.Q' in the field, but no checks are in place to ensure this.
- The code does not handle invalid commands (e.g., out-of-bounds movements or invalid actions like 'X').
- The code does not account for multiple Quaffles in the field, although it assumes there is only one.
