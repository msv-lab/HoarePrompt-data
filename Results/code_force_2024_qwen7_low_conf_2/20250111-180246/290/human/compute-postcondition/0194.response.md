Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + (t + 1)]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` is `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`, otherwise it remains `None`, `quaffle_position` remains unchanged, `blue_score` remains unchanged, `red_score` remains unchanged, and `ball` is now `action[2]`. If `command == 'T'`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `command == 'C'`, `quaffle_carrier` is updated to `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`, otherwise it remains `None`, and `ball` is updated to `action[2]`.***
