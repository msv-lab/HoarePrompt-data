The code `field = [input().split() for _ in range(N)]` creates a list of lists, where each inner list is a split of an input string. The number of inner lists is determined by `N`, and the content of each inner list is determined by the corresponding input string split by whitespace.

Given the initial state where `N` and `M` are integers assigned from the input, the code does not affect the values of `N` and `M`. However, it assigns a new list `field` which contains `N` sublists, each of which is the result of splitting an input string by whitespace.

To summarize:
- `N` and `M` remain unchanged.
- `field` is now a list of `N` sublists, each of which is a list of strings obtained from an input.

Since the exact content of the input strings is not specified, we can only describe the structure of the `field` list in terms of its length and the nature of its contents.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers assigned from the input, field is a list of N sublists, each sublist is a list of strings obtained from an input.**
