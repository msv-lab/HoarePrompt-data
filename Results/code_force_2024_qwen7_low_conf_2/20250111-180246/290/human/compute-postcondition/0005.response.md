The code initializes a dictionary `goals` with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'` and both values set to `0`. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `N` and `M` are integers assigned from the input, `field` is a list of `N` sublists, each sublist is a list of strings obtained from an input; `actions` is a list of `T` sublists, each sublist is created by splitting a line of input; `quaffle_position` is `None`; `goals` is a dictionary with keys `'RG'` and `'BG'` and both values equal to `0`**
