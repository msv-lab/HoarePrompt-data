The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `quaffle_position`. This means `quaffle_position` is now a tuple containing the values of `i` and `j`. The values of `N`, `M`, `field[i][j]`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0, `field[0][j]` is '.', `field[i][j]` is 'Q', `quaffle_position` is (0, j)**
