Postcondition: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0. If `field[0][j]` is '.', and `field[i][j]` is 'Q', then `quaffle_position` is (0, j). If `field[i][j]` is 'RG' or 'BG', then either `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` is 'RG', or `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` is 'BG'. If `field[i][j]` is neither 'RG' nor 'BG', and the first character is either 'R' or 'B', then `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` is set to (0, `j`). Otherwise, no changes occur.**
