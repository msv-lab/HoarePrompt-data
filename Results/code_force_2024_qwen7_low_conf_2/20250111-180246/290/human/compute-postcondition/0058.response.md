Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `M` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `quaffle_position` is (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` is \('.Q'\), otherwise it remains unchanged, `goals['RG']` is the count of 'RG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'RG', `goals['BG']` is the count of 'BG' sightings updated by adding 1 if `field[i][j]` was 'BG', `players['R'][1]` is (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` was 'R', `players['B'][1]` is (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` was 'B', `players['Q'][1]` is (1, 0) if `field[i][j]` was \('.Q\'\), `team` is the first element of `field[i][j]`, `number` is the second element of `field[i][j]`***

Explanation: The if statement checks if the first character of `field[i][j]` is either 'R' or 'B'. If true, the program updates the relevant player's position or quaffle position according to the second character of `field[i][j]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition includes the updates from the if part only, ensuring that the conditions and values are consistent with the initial precondition.
