The code `quaffle_position = players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` assigns the value of `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]` to the variable `quaffle_position`. The initial state only provides the assignment of `quaffle_position` but does not specify the exact values of `players`, `entity[0]`, or `entity[1]`. However, we can still express the updated state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`quaffle_position` is `players[entity[0]][entity[1]]`, `players` and `entity` retain their initial values**
