The code increments the score of the `opposite_team` by 1. Given the initial state, the `opposite_team` is 'B'. Therefore, the score of team 'B' is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `quaffle_position` is either `((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1)` or the final position of the entity specified in `actions`; `goals['RG']` is the total count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the total count of 'BG' sightings; `players['R'][number]` is the final position of player 'R' with number `number` for all valid numbers; `players['B'][number]` is the final position of player 'B' with number `number` for all valid numbers; `actions` is not an empty list; `scoring_team` is 'R'; `opposite_team` is 'B'; `score['B']` is incremented by 1.**
