The code `print(f'FINAL SCORE: {red_score} {blue_score}')` does not change any variables; it only prints the values of `red_score` and `blue_score`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `entity` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]` at index 0, `action` is the split result of `data[N + 2 + t]`, `command` is `action[1]`, `quaffle_carrier` is `entity` if `ball` equals `'.Q'` and `command == 'C'`, otherwise `quaffle_carrier` is `None`, `quaffle_position` is the position of `quaffle_carrier` in the field, `blue_score` is the total blue goals scored, `red_score` is the total red goals scored, `positions` is the dictionary containing the positions of all entities, `M` is the number of columns processed, `j` is the last column index processed, `cell` is the value of `field[x][y]` at the current position, `red_score` is the number of red goals scored, `blue_score` is the number of blue goals scored. The final score is printed as `FINAL SCORE: {red_score} {blue_score}`.**
