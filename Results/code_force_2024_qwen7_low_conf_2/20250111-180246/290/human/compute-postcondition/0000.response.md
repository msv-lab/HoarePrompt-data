The code `N, M = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `N` and `M`. Before this code is executed, the initial state includes `N` and `M` being integers obtained from the input.

Since the input values for `N` and `M` are read during the execution of this line of code, their specific values cannot be determined without actual input. However, the structure of the output state will reflect that these variables have been assigned the values from the input.

Output State: **`N` and `M` are integers assigned from the input.**
