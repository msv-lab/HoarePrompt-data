`goals[field[i][j]]` is assigned the value 1 more than its current value. The value of `field[i][j]` is `M + 1` since `j` is `M + 1`. Given that `M` is greater than 0, `field[i][j]` is greater than 1. The value of `goals` is updated, but the exact value of `goals[field[i][j]]` cannot be determined without knowing its initial value. However, it will be increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `M + 1`, `M` is greater than 0; `goals[field[i][j]]` is increased by 1**
