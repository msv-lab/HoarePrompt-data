Postcondition: ***`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` must be greater than 0. If the field at position `[i][j]` is 'RG' or 'BG', `goals['RG']` is incremented by 1 if `field[i][j]` is 'RG', otherwise `goals['BG']` is incremented by 1. If the field at position `[i][j]` is neither 'RG' nor 'BG', and the first character is either 'R' or 'B', then `players['R'][number]` or `players['B'][number]` is set to (0, `j`). Otherwise, no change occurs.***
