The code assigns the value of `opposite_team` based on the value of `scoring_team`. If `scoring_team` is 'R', then `opposite_team` becomes 'B'; otherwise, it remains 'R'. The values of other variables are not affected.

- If `scoring_team` was 'R', then `opposite_team` is set to 'B'.
- If `scoring_team` was 'B', then `opposite_team` remains 'R'.

Given the initial state where `scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` will be set to 'R'.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M` is a positive integer, `quaffle_position` is the last position where '.Q' is found or None if '.Q' is not found, `goals['RG']` is the total count of 'RG' sightings, `goals['BG']` is the total count of 'BG' sightings, `players['R'][number]` is the final position of player 'R' with number `number`, `players['B'][number]` is the final position of player 'B' with number `number` for all valid numbers, `actions` is not an empty list, `scoring_team` is 'B', `opposite_team` is 'R'.**
