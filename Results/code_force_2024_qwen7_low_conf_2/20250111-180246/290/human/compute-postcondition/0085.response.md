The code assigns a tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `quaffle_position`. The value of `j` is `M`, and the value of `M` is greater than 0, but the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the new variable `quaffle_position` which holds the tuple `(i, M)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `M`, `M` is greater than 0, `quaffle_position` is `(i, M)`**
