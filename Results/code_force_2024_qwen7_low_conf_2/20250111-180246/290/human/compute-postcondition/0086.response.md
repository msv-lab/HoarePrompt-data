`goals[field[i][j]]` is assigned the value `1` more than its current value. Since `field[i][j]` is a key in the `goals` dictionary and `j` is `M`, the value of `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`j` is `M`, `M` is greater than 0; `goals[field[i][j]]` is incremented by 1**
