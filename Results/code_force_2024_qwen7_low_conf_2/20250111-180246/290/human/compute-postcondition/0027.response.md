Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `M` is greater than 0, `j` is less than `M`. If `field[i][j][0]` is either 'R' or 'B', then `team` is the first element of `field[0][j]`, `number` is the second element of `field[0][j]`, `i` is 0, `players[team][number]` is `[0, j]`. If `field[i][j][0]` is not 'R' or 'B', no changes are made to the variables.***
