### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the function summary and the original assessment.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1()` correctly handles the following aspects:
1. Reading the initial field configuration.
2. Iterating through each step of the game.
3. Updating the positions of players based on the actions specified.
4. Checking if the Quaffle is moved into a goal.
5. Resetting the Quaffle to the center of the field when a goal is scored.
6. Printing the final score.

However, the function summary mentions a potential issue that the current implementation does not account for when a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. According to the problem description, this should result in the opposing team scoring a point. Let's examine the code to see if it handles this scenario.

#### Code Analysis:
The relevant part of the code that checks for scoring a goal is:
```python
if quaffle_position in goals:
    scoring_team = 'R' if quaffle_position in ['BG'] else 'B'
    opposite_team = 'B' if scoring_team == 'R' else 'R'
    score[opposite_team] += 1
    print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')
    quaffle_position = ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1)
```

This code checks if `quaffle_position` is in the `goals` dictionary, which contains the goal positions ('RG' and 'BG'). When the Quaffle is moved into one of these positions, the corresponding scoring logic is executed. 

However, the code does not handle the case where the Quaffle is thrown into a goal that belongs to the player's own team. The check `if quaffle_position in goals:` only applies to the initial positions of the goals, not to the dynamic positions of the Quaffle during gameplay.

To address this, we need to ensure that the Quaffle's position is checked against the goal positions at every step, not just in the initial configuration. The correct approach would be to update the `goals` dictionary to include the positions where the Quaffle could be moved to during gameplay.

### Addressing the Issue:
We need to modify the code to include the positions of the Quaffle in the `goals` dictionary dynamically. We can do this by adding a check to see if the Quaffle's position is a goal position during each step.

Here's the modified code snippet:
```python
for (t, (entity, action, *args)) in enumerate(actions):
    # Update the Quaffle position if necessary
    if entity == '.Q':
        quaffle_position = (int(args[0]), int(args[1]))
    # ... (other action handling)

    if quaffle_position in goals:
        scoring_team = 'R' if quaffle_position in ['BG'] else 'B'
        opposite_team = 'B' if scoring_team == 'R' else 'R'
        score[opposite_team] += 1
        print(f'{t} {opposite_team.upper()} GOAL')
        quaffle_position = ((N + 1) // 2 - 1, (M + 1) // 2 - 1)
```

By including the Quaffle's position in the `goals` dictionary dynamically, we ensure that the scoring logic is applied correctly even when the Quaffle is moved into a goal during gameplay.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, resulting in the opposing team scoring a point. The modified code provided above addresses this issue, but the original code does not.

**Final: False**
