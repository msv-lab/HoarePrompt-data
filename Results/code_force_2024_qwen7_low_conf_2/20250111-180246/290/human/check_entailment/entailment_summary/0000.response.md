Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the field dimensions \(N\) and \(M\).
2. It properly reads the initial field configuration, identifying players, goals, and the quaffle's starting position.
3. The program accurately tracks the movements of the players and updates their positions accordingly.
4. The program checks if the quaffle has been moved to a goal and updates the score and the quaffle's position appropriately.
5. The program prints the score at the end of the game in the required format.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for processing the game scenario as described. There are no apparent errors in the program's logic based on the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
