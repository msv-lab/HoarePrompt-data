Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle to a goal that belongs to their own team. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the opposing team should score a point. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the check for scoring a goal is only performed when the Quaffle is found in the `goals` dictionary, which only includes the goals themselves ('RG' or 'BG'), not the positions of the Quaffle after it has been thrown by a player. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
```

In this case, the red player (`R0`) picks up the Quaffle, moves to the right, and throws it towards the red goal (`RG`). The program should detect this and award a point to the blue team, but it does not currently do so. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
