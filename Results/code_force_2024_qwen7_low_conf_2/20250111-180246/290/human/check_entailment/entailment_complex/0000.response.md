Reasoning:
- The program correctly initializes the field dimensions, counts the goals, and tracks the players' and quaffle's positions.
- The program processes each action in the game and updates the positions accordingly.
- If the quaffle is thrown into an opposing team's goal, the program correctly increments the score for the opposing team and resets the quaffle to the center of the field.
- The program outputs the correct sequence of events and the final score.

Given the provided annotations and the logic in the code, the program appears to follow the rules and requirements of the problem statement accurately. It correctly processes the input, updates the game state, and outputs the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
