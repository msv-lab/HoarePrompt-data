The code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` creates a list `a` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The initial state provides us with the following:

- `bets` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`
- `i` is either 0 or `bets`
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`
- `T` is `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`

After executing the code `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]`, the value of `a` will be a list of integers obtained from the input. However, the initial values of `bets`, `i`, `sumo`, and `T` remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the new input or computation.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input.
- The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `T`) remain in their initial states unless they are recalculated or redefined based on the new `a`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`bets` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `i` is either 0 or `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
