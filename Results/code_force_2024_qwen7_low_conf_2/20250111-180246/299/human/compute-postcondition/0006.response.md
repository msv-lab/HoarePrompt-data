The value of `prod` is multiplied by `r`. Initially, `prod` is the first element of `vals`, and `r` is the second element of `vals`. After executing `prod *= r`, the value of `prod` will be updated to the product of its original value and `r`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\), `prod` is the product of the first and second elements of `vals`, `r` is the second element of `vals`**
