The code snippet updates the `ans` variable by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (assuming `a` is a list or similar structure) followed by a space. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `a`. Since `i` is set to 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `bets` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `sumo` is 0
- `prod` is greater than `sumo`
- `ans` is an empty string

After executing the line `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '`, the value of `ans` changes to the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space. Since the exact value of `a[1]` is not specified, we can denote it as `a[1]`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `bets` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `sumo` is 0
- `prod` is greater than `sumo`
- `ans` is now `str(a[1]) + ' '` (the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space)

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `sumo` is 0, `prod` is greater than `sumo`, `ans` is `str(a[1]) + ' '`**
