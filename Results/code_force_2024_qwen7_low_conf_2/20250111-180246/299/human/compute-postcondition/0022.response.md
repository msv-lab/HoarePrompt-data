The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments the value of `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. 

From the initial state:
- `bets` is a non-negative integer greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`
- `a[1]` is `p // a[1]`

Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. And `a[1]` is already given as `p // a[1]`. So, we need to convert `a[1]` to an integer and add it to `sumo`.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` and then by `p // a[1]`, `a[1]` is `p // a[1]`**
