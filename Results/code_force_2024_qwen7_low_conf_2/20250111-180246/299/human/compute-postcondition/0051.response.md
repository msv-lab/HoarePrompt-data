Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a list of integers `l` and computes the product of all elements in the list. The function initializes a variable `g` to 1 and then iterates through the list `l`, updating `g` by multiplying it with each element in the list after performing a GCD operation between `g` and the current element. After the loop, the function returns `g`, which is the product of all elements in the list `l`. The function handles the case where the list `l` is empty by ensuring that `g` remains 1.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `l` is empty, the function will return `1` since no multiplication occurs.
- The function assumes that all elements in the list `l` are integers. If the list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a TypeError during the division and multiplication operations.
