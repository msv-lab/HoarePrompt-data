The code snippet `print(-1)` simply prints `-1` to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. The only impact is the output `-1`. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T_prev + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, and the current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, and the output is -1**
