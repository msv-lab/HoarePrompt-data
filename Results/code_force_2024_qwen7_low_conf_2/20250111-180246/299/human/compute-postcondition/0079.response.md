To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Variables and Conditions:**
   - `i` is `bets`.
   - `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`.
   - `T` is either `T_prev + 1` or `T_prev + bets` depending on whether `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.
   - `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`.
   - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the function returns -1.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `T` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We know the state at the end of the previous iteration (the one just before this current iteration).
   - Specifically, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is either `T_prev + 1` or `T_prev + bets` depending on the condition mentioned above, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, and if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `ans` is printed. Otherwise, the function returns -1.

4. **Starting State for Current Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, the variable `T` will be incremented by 1, assuming the function does not return -1 from the previous iteration.
   - Therefore, `T` will become `T_prev + 1` if `sumo` was less than `prod` and `ans` was printed, or it will become `T_prev + bets` if `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod`.
   - The values of `i`, `sumo`, `a[i]`, and `prod` remain unchanged as they depend on the original list `a` and the condition checks performed in the loop body, but since we are starting a new iteration, these values stay as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` remains `bets`.
   - `sumo` remains the same.
   - `a[i]` remains the same.
   - `prod` remains the same.
   - `T` becomes `T_prev + 1` if `sumo` was less than `prod`, or `T_prev + bets` if `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T_prev + 1` if `sumo` was less than `prod`, or `T_prev + bets` if `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`.**
