Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `bets` is a positive integer.
- `i` is initially set to `bets`.
- `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`.
- `sumo` is the sum of `a[0]` and `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1` and is less than `prod`.
- `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- `ans` is an empty string.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(bets):
    ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = bets - 1`.
   - During each iteration, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.

2. **Final Value of `i`:**
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `bets - 1`.

3. **Final Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` will contain the string representations of all elements in the list `a` concatenated together, separated by spaces.
   - Specifically, `ans` will be `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[1]) + ' ' + ... + ' ' + str(a[bets-1])`.

4. **Values of `a[i]`:**
   - Each `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `bets-1`) is set to `prod // a[i]`. This means `a[i] * a[i] == prod` for each `i`.

5. **Condition `sumo < prod`:**
   - `sumo` is the sum of `a[0]` and `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1` and must be less than `prod`.
   - Since each `a[i]` is such that `a[i] * a[i] == prod`, the values of `a[i]` are the square roots of `prod`.

### Final Output State
After the loop has executed all iterations, the values of the variables will be as follows:
- `bets` remains a positive integer.
- `i` will be `bets - 1`.
- `a[i]` (for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`) will be the square root of `prod`.
- `ans` will be the string representations of all `a[i]` values concatenated together, separated by spaces.

### Output State:
**Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is the square root of `prod` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `ans` is the concatenation of the string representations of `a[0]` through `a[bets-1]`, separated by spaces.**
