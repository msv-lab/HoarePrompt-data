Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\), `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list of length \(N\) where `vprod[i]` is `prod // vals[i]` for each `i` in range \(0, N\), and `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`. The difference `den` is greater than 0.**
