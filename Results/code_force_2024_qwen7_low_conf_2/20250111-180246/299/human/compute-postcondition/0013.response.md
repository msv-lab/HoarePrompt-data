The code prints `-1`, which does not change any variable values or the conditions of the initial state. The only difference is that the print statement is executed. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the printed value.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\), `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list of length \(N\) where `vprod[i]` is `prod // vals[i]` for each `i` in range \(0, N\), and `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`; `den` is less than or equal to 0; -1 is printed.**
