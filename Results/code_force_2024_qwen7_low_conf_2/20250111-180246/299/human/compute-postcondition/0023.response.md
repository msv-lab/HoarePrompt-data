According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `bets`. If `i` is less than `bets`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `bets` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `bets` must remain the same as it was at the end of the last iteration.

Let's break down the changes:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop counter `i` starts from 0, and it needs to reach 1 before the first iteration and 2 for the next iteration, `i` should be 2.
2. **Keep `bets` unchanged**: The number of iterations `bets` remains the same because the condition for the loop depends only on the value of `bets`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2**
