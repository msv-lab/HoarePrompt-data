`prod` is initially the product of the first and second elements of `vals`. The code multiplies `prod` by `r`, which is now the third element of `vals`. Therefore, `prod` is updated to be the product of the first, second, and third elements of `vals`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\), `prod` is the product of the first, second, and third elements of `vals`, `r` is the third element of `vals`**.
