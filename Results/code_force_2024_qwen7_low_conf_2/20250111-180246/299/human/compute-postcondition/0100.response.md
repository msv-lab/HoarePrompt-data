The code `sumo += int(a[i])` impacts the `sumo` variable by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. From the initial state, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`.

Therefore, the calculation for `sumo` becomes:

- Initial `sumo` is `sumo + a[0]`.
- After the operation, `sumo` will be updated to `sumo + a[0] + (prod // a[2])`.

Since the other variables (`bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, and `a[2]`) are not affected by this operation, they remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is `sumo + a[0] + (prod // a[2])`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`**
