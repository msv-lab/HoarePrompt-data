`sumo` is assigned the value of `int(a[i])`, where `i` is 2. Therefore, `sumo` is assigned the value of `int(a[2])`. The value of `a[2]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`, and `sumo` is incremented by this new value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `a[2]` is updated to `prod // a[2]`, `a[0]` remains unchanged, `a[1]` remains unchanged, `prod` remains the LCM of the original list `a`, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[2])`**
