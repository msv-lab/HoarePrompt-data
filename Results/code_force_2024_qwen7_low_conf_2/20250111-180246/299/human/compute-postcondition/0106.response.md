The code `print(-1)` prints the value `-1` but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `bets`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[0]` and `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1` and is greater than or equal to `prod`, and for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`. The value printed is -1.**
