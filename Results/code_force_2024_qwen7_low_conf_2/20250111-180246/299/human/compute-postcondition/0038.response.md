The code `print(ans)` prints the value of the variable `ans`. However, this does not affect the values of the other variables. The states of the other variables (`bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `prod`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `bets`, `sumo` is 0, `prod` is greater than `sumo`, `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, `ans` is printed.**
