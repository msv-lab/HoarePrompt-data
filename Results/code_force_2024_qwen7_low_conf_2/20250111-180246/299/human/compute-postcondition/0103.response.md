The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, we are updating `sumo` by adding `a[3]`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`

So, the updated value of `sumo` will be `sumo + a[3]`. 

The other variables (`bets`, `i`, `a[0]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is `sumo + (prod // a[3])`, `a[2]` is `prod // a[2]`, `a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`**
