The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `i` is 3
- `bets` must be greater than 3
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`
- `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`
- `T` is `T_prev + 1`
- `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`
- `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[2])`

The code snippet given is:
```python
ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
```

This means that `ans` is appended with the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Since `i` is 3, `a[3]` will be added to `ans`.

Let's consider the value of `a[3]`. We know that initially, `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[2])`. So, let's denote the initial values of `a[0]` and `a[2]` as `val0` and `val2` respectively.

Thus, before the operation, `ans` is `str(val0) + ' ' + str(val2)`.

After the operation, `ans` will be:
```python
ans = str(val0) + ' ' + str(val2) + str(a[3]) + ' '
```

Since none of the other variables (`i`, `bets`, `sumo`, `a[0]`, `T`, `prod`) are directly modified in this line of code, their values remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 3, `bets` must be greater than 3, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, `ans` is `str(val0) + ' ' + str(val2) + str(a[3]) + ' '`**
