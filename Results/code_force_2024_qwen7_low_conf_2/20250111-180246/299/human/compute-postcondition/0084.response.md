The code updates the value of `g` by multiplying it with `l[i]` and then taking the result modulo the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `l[i]` refers to the second element of the list `l`.

From the initial state:
- `g` is `l[0]`
- `i` is 1
- `a[i]` is the second element of `l` (which is the same as `l[1]`)

The code updates `g` as follows:
\[ g = g \times l[i] \mod \text{gcd}(g, l[i]) \]
Since `i` is 1, this becomes:
\[ g = l[0] \times l[1] \mod \text{gcd}(l[0], l[1]) \]

Given the initial state:
- `g` is `l[0]`

Therefore, the new value of `g` is:
\[ g = l[0] \times l[1] \mod \text{gcd}(l[0], l[1]) \]

The other variables (`i`, `bets`, `sumo`, `a[i]`, `prod`, and `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g` is `l[0] * l[1] % gcd(l[0], l[1])`, `i` is 1, `bets` remains `bets`, `sumo` remains the same, `a[i]` is the second element of `l`, `prod` remains the same, `T` remains the same**
