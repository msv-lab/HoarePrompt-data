`bets` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `bets` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `i` is either 0 or `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`.
