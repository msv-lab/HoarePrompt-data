Postcondition: ***`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is `bets`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[0]` and `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. For all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the value printed is -1. Otherwise, `ans` retains its previous value.***
