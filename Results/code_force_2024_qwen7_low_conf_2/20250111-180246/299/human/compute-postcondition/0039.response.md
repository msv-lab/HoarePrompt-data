Postcondition: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is either 0 or `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`. If `sumo >= prod`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, and `ans` is printed.**
