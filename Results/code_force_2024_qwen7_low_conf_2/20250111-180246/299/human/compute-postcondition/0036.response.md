The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the string `str(a[i]) + ' '` to the current value of `ans`. Given the initial state:

- `bets` must be greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `sumo` is 0
- `prod` is greater than `sumo`
- `ans` is `str(a[1]) + ' '`

Let's break down the steps:

1. Initially, `ans` is set to `str(a[1]) + ' '`.
2. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
3. The code concatenates `str(a[2]) + ' '` to the existing value of `ans`.

Given the initial value of `ans` is `str(a[1]) + ' '`, after the operation, `ans` becomes `str(a[1]) + str(a[2]) + ' '`.

Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `sumo` is 0, `prod` is greater than 0, `ans` is `str(a[1]) + str(a[2]) + ' '`**
