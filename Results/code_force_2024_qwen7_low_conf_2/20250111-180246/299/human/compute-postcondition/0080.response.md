The code `g = 1` assigns the value `1` to the variable `g`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `g` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`g` is 1, `i` remains `bets`, `sumo` remains the same, `a[i]` remains the same, `prod` remains the same, `T` becomes `T_prev + 1` if `sumo` was less than `prod`, or `T_prev + bets` if `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod`.**
