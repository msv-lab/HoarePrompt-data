Postcondition: ***`i` is `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is either `T_prev + 1` or `T_prev + bets` depending on whether `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, and if `sumo` is less than `prod`, `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1` and `ans` is printed, otherwise the function returns -1.***
