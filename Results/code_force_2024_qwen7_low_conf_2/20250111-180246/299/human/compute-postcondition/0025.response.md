The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates the value of `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. From the initial state, `bets` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is already defined as `prod // a[i]`, the code essentially adds `prod // a[i]` to `sumo`.

Given this, `sumo` will now be equal to its previous value plus `prod // a[i]`. The other variables (`bets` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `sumo` is the previous value of `sumo` plus `prod // a[i]`**
