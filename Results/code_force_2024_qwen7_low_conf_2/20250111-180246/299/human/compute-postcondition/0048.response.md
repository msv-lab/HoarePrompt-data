Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is `len(l)`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`, `g` is the product of all elements in `l` (i.e., `g = l[0] * l[1] * ... * l[len(l) - 1]`), and `l` must have at least one element.**
