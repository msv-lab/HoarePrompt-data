The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. The value of `i` is 0, so `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. However, the exact value of `a[0]` is unknown. The precondition also states that `bets` must be a non-negative integer and `i` is 0. These values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, and `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]`.**
