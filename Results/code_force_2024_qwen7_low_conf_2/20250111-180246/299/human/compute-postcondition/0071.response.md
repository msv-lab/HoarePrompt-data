The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to `ans`. The value of `i` is not specified in the snippet, so we assume it iterates over the range from `0` to `bets - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `0`
- `bets` is a positive integer
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`
- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`
- `T` is `T_prev + 1`
- `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`
- `ans` is an empty string

After the first iteration (assuming `i = 0`):
- `ans` will be `str(a[0]) + ' '`
- `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`

The output state after the first iteration is:
- `i` is `1`
- `bets` remains a positive integer
- `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1`
- `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`
- `T` is `T_prev + 1`
- `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`
- `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' '`

Since the exact value of `a[0]` is not given, we represent it as `prod // a[0]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `bets` is a positive integer, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' '`**
