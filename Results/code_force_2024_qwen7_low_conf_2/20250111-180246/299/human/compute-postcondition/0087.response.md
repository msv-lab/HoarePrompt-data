Output State: **`g` is the product of all elements in `l` modulo the greatest common divisor of `g` and each element, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `bets` remains `bets`, `sumo` remains the same, `a[i]` is the last element of `l`, `prod` remains the same, `T` is `T_prev + 1` if `sumo` was less than `prod`, or `T_prev + bets` if `sumo` was greater than or equal to `prod`, `l` is a list with at least one element.**
