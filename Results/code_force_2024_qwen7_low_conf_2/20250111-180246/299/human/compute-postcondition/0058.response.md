`sumo` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[0]`. The new value of `sumo` will be `0 + prod // a[0]` because `sumo` was previously 0 and `a[0]` was updated to `prod // a[0]`.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `sumo` is `prod // a[0]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1`, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `a[j]` (for j â‰  0) remains unchanged, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`**
