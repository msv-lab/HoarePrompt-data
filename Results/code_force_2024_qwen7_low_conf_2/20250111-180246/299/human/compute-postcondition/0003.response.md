Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Range**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `vals`. The loop variable is `r`.

2. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of `N` integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\); this means each element in `vals` is between 2 and 20 inclusive.
   - `prod` is 1.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `vals` must contain at least one element. This is ensured by the value of `N`, which specifies the length of the list `vals`.
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `vals`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `vals` contains at least one element (which it does since `N` is specified as a positive integer between 1 and 50).
   - The initial value of `prod` is 1, and this will be updated inside the loop, but we don't need to adjust `prod` for the loop to execute.
   - Since the loop will iterate over all elements in `vals`, we need to indicate that `r` starts as the first element of `vals`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `vals` must be a list of length `N` with each element between 2 and 20.
- `r` should be the first element of `vals`.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `prod` is 1, `r` is the first element of `vals`**
