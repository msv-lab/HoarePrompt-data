Output State: **`i` is `bets`, `bets` is a positive integer, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[i]` (for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`) is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `T` is `T_prev + bets`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of `str(a[i]) + ' '` for all `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`.**
