The code `sumo += int(a[i])` updates `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. The value of `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`.

Therefore, the impact is that `sumo` is updated by adding the value of `a[1]`, which is now `prod // a[1]`.

Output State: **`bets` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `sumo` is updated to `sumo + (prod // a[1])`, `T` remains `T_prev + 1`, `a[0]` remains `prod // a[0]`, `a[1]` is updated to `prod // a[1]`, and `prod` remains the LCM of the original list `a`.**
