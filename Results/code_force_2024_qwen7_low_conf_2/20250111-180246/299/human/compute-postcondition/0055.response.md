The code `sumo = 0` assigns the value 0 to `sumo`. This variable was previously in an initial state, and now it is explicitly set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.

Output State: **`bets` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, `i` is either 0 or `bets`, `sumo` is 0, `T` is `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`, `a` is a list of integers where each `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`.**
