The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` attempts to concatenate the string representation of `a[i]` to `ans`. However, there are a few issues here:
1. The variable `a` is not defined in the given initial state or code snippet.
2. The variable `ans` is not initialized, which means it might lead to a `NameError`.

Given these points, let's assume the intention was to initialize `ans` to an empty string before the operation. Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Initialization**: `ans` needs to be initialized to an empty string.
2. **Code Execution**: The code concatenates the string representation of `a[i]` (which is not defined) to `ans`.

Since `a` is not defined, we cannot proceed with the exact concatenation. However, assuming `a[3]` exists and its value is known, the updated `ans` would be the string representation of `a[3]` followed by a space.

For the sake of providing an answer, let's assume `a[3]` is defined and its value is known to be `value_of_a3`. The updated `ans` would be `"value_of_a3 "`.

Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans` is "value_of_a3 "`**
