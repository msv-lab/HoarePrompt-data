The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty string. The value of `i` is 0, and `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`. All other elements in `a` are also set similarly.

Given these conditions, when `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` is executed, `ans` becomes `str(a[0]) + ' '`. Since `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `ans` will be the string representation of `prod // a[0]` followed by a space.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `a[0]` is `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is the sum of `a[0]` and `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1` and is less than `prod`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, and `ans` is the string representation of `a[0]` followed by a space**
