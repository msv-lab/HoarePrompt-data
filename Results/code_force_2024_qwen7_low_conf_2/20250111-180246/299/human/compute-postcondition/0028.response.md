The code `print(-1)` simply prints the value `-1` to the console. This operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the only change is that the value `-1` is printed. All other variables retain their initial states.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and the condition `sumo >= prod` is true; -1 is printed**
