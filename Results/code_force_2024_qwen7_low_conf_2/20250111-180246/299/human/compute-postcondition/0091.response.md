The input statement `bets = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `bets`. This affects only the variable `bets` and does not alter the state of any other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **`bets` is an integer input from the user, `g` is 1, `i` is 0, `bets` remains `bets`, `sumo` remains the same, `a[i]` remains the same, `prod` remains the same, `T` remains the same, `l` is a list with at least one element.**
