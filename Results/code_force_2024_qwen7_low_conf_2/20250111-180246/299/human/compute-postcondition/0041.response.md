The code `g = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `g`. This assignment does not affect the values of `bets`, `i`, `sumo`, `a`, `T`, or `T_prev`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment to `g`.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is either 0 or `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `T` is `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`; `g` is 1.**
