`vals` is assigned a list of integers converted from the input string. The input string is split by spaces and each element is converted to an integer. The values of `t` and `N` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**
