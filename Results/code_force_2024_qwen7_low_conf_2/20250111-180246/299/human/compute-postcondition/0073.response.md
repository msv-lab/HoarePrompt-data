The code snippet `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` impacts the program by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` with the existing value of `ans`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `ans` initially is set to `str(a[0]) + ' '`, which means it starts as a string containing the value of `a[0]` followed by a space.
2. `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`.
3. Since `ans` is being updated to include `str(a[2]) + ' '`, the new value of `ans` will be `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[2]) + ' '`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 2, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `T` is `T_prev + 1`, `prod` is the LCM of the original list `a`, `ans` is `str(a[0]) + ' ' + str(a[2]) + ' '`**
