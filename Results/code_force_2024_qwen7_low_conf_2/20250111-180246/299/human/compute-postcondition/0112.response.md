`ans` is updated by appending the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space. Given that `i` is 1, `ans` will be updated to include the string representation of `a[1]`. The state of other variables such as `bets`, `a[0]`, `prod`, `sumo`, and `ans` will be affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is now 2 (as the loop will increment `i`), `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space, and all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[1]` followed by a space**
