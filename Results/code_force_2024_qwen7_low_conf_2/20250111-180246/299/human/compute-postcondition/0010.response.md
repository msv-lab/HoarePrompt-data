Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
   - `vals` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\).
   - `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`.
   - `r` is the last element of `vals`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code `vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]` iterates over each element `r` in the list `vals` and computes `prod // r` (integer division). This results in a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` except the current element `r`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - `vals` remains unchanged.
   - `prod` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - A new list `vprod` is created.

4. **Specific Values**:
   - Since `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, and `r` is the last element of `vals`, the first element of `vprod` will be `prod // r`.
   - The second element of `vprod` will be `prod // vals[1]`, and so on.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of \(N\) integers such that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\), `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, and `vprod` is a list of length \(N\) where `vprod[i]` is `prod // vals[i]` for each `i` in range \(0, N\).**
