Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) as input. For each test case within `t`, it reads an integer `N` such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\) and a list of `N` integers `vals` where each integer \(k_i\) satisfies \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\). The function calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and stores it in `prod`. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element `vprod[i]` is `prod // vals[i]`. After that, it calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)` and checks if `den` is less than or equal to 0. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns immediately. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `den` is exactly 0, the condition `if (den <= 0):` will be true, and the function will print `-1` and return. This is already covered by the annotation.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation incorrectly states that the function returns `-1`. However, based on the actual code, the function does not return anything explicitly; instead, it either prints `-1` and returns implicitly or prints the elements of `vprod` and exits normally. Therefore, the correct statement should be that the function either prints `-1` or prints the elements of `vprod`.
