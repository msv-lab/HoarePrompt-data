Output State: **`bets` remains a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `sumo` remains the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets - 1` where `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, `T` remains `T_prev + 1` with the condition that `T_prev + 1 < t`, `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `l` must still have at least one element.**
