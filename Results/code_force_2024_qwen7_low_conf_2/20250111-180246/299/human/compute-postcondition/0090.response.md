Functionality: **The function `lcm` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a list of integers. It initializes `g` to 1 and iterates over each element in the list `l`. During each iteration, `g` is updated to be the product of `g` and the current element in `l`, modulo the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `g` and the current element. After the loop, the function returns `g`, which is the product of all elements in `l` modulo the GCD of `g` and each element. The function handles the case where the list `l` contains at least one element. If the list is empty, the initial value of `g` (which is 1) would remain unchanged, resulting in `g` being 1.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `l` is empty, the function should return 1, as the product of an empty list modulo any number is 1.
- If the list `l` contains only one element, the function will return that element itself, as there are no other elements to compute the GCD with.
