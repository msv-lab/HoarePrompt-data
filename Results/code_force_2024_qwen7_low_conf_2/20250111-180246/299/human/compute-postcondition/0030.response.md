The code `ans = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `ans`. The values of the other variables (`bets`, `i`, `sumo`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `sumo` is 0, and `prod` is greater than `sumo`; `ans` is an empty string.

Output State: **`bets` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `sumo` is 0, and `prod` is greater than `sumo`; `ans` is an empty string**
