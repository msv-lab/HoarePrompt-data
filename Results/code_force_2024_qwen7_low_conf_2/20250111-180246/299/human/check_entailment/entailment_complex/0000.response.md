### Reasoning:

The goal of the program is to correctly determine the distribution of coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Let's break down the logic of the provided code:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers (`k_i`).

2. **Product Calculation**: The program calculates the product of all the multipliers (`prod`). This is crucial because the required distribution of coins must be such that the sum of these distributions is less than the product itself.

3. **Distribution Calculation**: For each multiplier `k_i`, the program calculates `vprod[i] = prod // k_i`. This represents the amount of coins to bet on the `i-th` outcome.

4. **Validation Check**: The program then calculates `den = prod - sum(vprod)`. This value should be positive, indicating that the total bet is less than the total gain from any winning outcome.

5. **Output**: If `den` is positive, the program prints the calculated `vprod` values as a space-separated string. If `den` is non-positive, the program prints `-1`.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `prod == sum(vprod)`, `den` will be zero, which means the total bet is not strictly less than the total gain. Hence, the program correctly prints `-1`.
  - If `prod < sum(vprod)`, `den` will be negative, which again means the total bet is not strictly less than the total gain. The program correctly handles this by printing `-1`.

- **General Case**:
  - The product calculation ensures that `vprod[i]` is an integer, and since `prod` is the product of all `k_i`, `vprod[i]` will be `floor(prod / k_i)`.
  - Given the constraints (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), the product `prod` will be significantly larger than the sum of `vprod`, ensuring that `den` is positive.

- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly identifies when the total bet is not strictly less than the total gain and prints `-1` in those cases.
  - When the condition is met, the logic correctly distributes the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the total gain.

### Conclusion:

The provided code accurately implements the required logic and correctly handles all edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
