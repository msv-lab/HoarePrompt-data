Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. Instead, it calculates the product of all multipliers and then distributes the coins in a way that may not satisfy the required condition.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
3
5 5 5
```

The program would calculate the product of the multipliers as \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\). Then it would distribute the coins as \(\frac{125}{5}, \frac{125}{5}, \frac{125}{5}\), which results in \(25, 25, 25\). However, the total amount bet is \(25 + 25 + 25 = 75\), but for the winning outcome, you would receive \(5 \times 25 = 125\) coins, which is more than 75. This satisfies the condition, but let's consider another case.

Consider the following input:

```
3
2 3 4
```

The program would calculate the product of the multipliers as \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\). Then it would distribute the coins as \(\frac{24}{2}, \frac{24}{3}, \frac{24}{4}\), which results in \(12, 8, 6\). The total amount bet is \(12 + 8 + 6 = 26\). For the winning outcomes, you would receive \(2 \times 12 = 24\), \(3 \times 8 = 24\), and \(4 \times 6 = 24\) coins, respectively, none of which are strictly greater than 26. Therefore, the program fails to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Hence, the program is incorrect.
