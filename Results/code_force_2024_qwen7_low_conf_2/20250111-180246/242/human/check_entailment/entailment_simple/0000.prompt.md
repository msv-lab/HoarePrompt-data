You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given n positive integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n and three positive
integers n_a, n_b, n_c satisfying n_a+n_b+n_c = n .

You want to split the n positive integers into three groups, so that:

  * The first group contains n_a numbers, the second group contains n_b numbers, the third group contains n_c numbers.
  * Let s_a be the sum of the numbers in the first group, s_b be the sum in the second group, and s_c be the sum in the third group. Then s_a, s_b, s_c are the sides of a triangle with positive area.

Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1\le t\le 100\,000 ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t
test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the integers n, n_a, n_b, n_c (3
\leq n \leq 200\,000, 1\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n ) — the
number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the
three groups.

The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n (1
\leq x_i \leq 10^{9} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed
200\,000 .

Output

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to split the numbers
into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}
.

If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.

On the next line, print n_a integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_a} — the numbers
in the first group.

On the next line, print n_b integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n_b} — the numbers
in the second group.

On the next line, print n_c integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n_c} — the numbers
in the third group.

These n_a+n_b+n_c=n integers should be a permutation of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n
, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 3 1 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 3
    
    8 1 2 5
    
    16 1 1 1 1 1 1 12

Output

    YES
    1 1 
    1 1 
    1 1 
    NO
    NO
    YES
    16 
    12 1 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, we can put two 1 s into each group: the sum in each
group would be 2 , and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides 2
, 2 , 2 .

In the second and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way
to split numbers into groups.

In the fourth test case, we can put number 16 into the first group, with sum
16 , numbers 12 and 1 into the second group, with sum 13 , and the remaining
five 1 s into the third group, with sum 5 , as there exists a triangle with
positive area and sides 16, 13, 5 .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000. For each test case, n, n_a, n_b, n_c are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 1 ≤ n_a, n_b, n_c ≤ n-2, and n_a + n_b + n_c = n. The list of integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, na, nb, nc = map(int, input().split())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x.sort(reverse=True)
        
        group_a = x[:na]
        
        group_b = x[na:na + nb]
        
        group_c = x[na + nb:]
        
        sum_a = sum(group_a)
        
        sum_b = sum(group_b)
        
        sum_c = sum(group_c)
        
        if sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and sum_c + sum_a > sum_b:
            print('YES')
            print(' '.join(map(str, group_a)))
            print(' '.join(map(str, group_b)))
            print(' '.join(map(str, group_c)))
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t = 0\); `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na - 1`; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in `group_a`; `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`. If the conditions `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b` hold true, the function prints 'YES' followed by the elements of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` each on a new line. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
