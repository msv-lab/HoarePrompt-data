You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n positive integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n and three positive
integers n_a, n_b, n_c satisfying n_a+n_b+n_c = n .

You want to split the n positive integers into three groups, so that:

  * The first group contains n_a numbers, the second group contains n_b numbers, the third group contains n_c numbers.
  * Let s_a be the sum of the numbers in the first group, s_b be the sum in the second group, and s_c be the sum in the third group. Then s_a, s_b, s_c are the sides of a triangle with positive area.

Determine if this is possible. If this is possible, find one way to do so.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1\le t\le 100\,000 ) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the t
test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the integers n, n_a, n_b, n_c (3
\leq n \leq 200\,000, 1\leq n_a,n_b,n_c \leq n-2, n_a+n_b+n_c = n ) — the
number of integers to split into three groups, and the desired sizes of the
three groups.

The second line of each test case contains n integers x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n (1
\leq x_i \leq 10^{9} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed
200\,000 .

Output

For each test case, print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to split the numbers
into three groups satisfying all the conditions. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO}
.

If such a split exists, then describe the three groups as follows.

On the next line, print n_a integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n_a} — the numbers
in the first group.

On the next line, print n_b integers b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{n_b} — the numbers
in the second group.

On the next line, print n_c integers c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_{n_c} — the numbers
in the third group.

These n_a+n_b+n_c=n integers should be a permutation of x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n
, and they should satisfy the conditions from the statement.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 3 1 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    6 2 2 2
    
    1 1 1 1 1 3
    
    8 1 2 5
    
    16 1 1 1 1 1 1 12

Output

    YES
    1 1 
    1 1 
    1 1 
    NO
    NO
    YES
    16 
    12 1 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, we can put two 1 s into each group: the sum in each
group would be 2 , and there exists a triangle with positive area and sides 2
, 2 , 2 .

In the second and third test cases, it can be shown that there is no such way
to split numbers into groups.

In the fourth test case, we can put number 16 into the first group, with sum
16 , numbers 12 and 1 into the second group, with sum 13 , and the remaining
five 1 s into the third group, with sum 5 , as there exists a triangle with
positive area and sides 16, 13, 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves dividing a list of integers into three sublists of specified sizes (`n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`). The function first reads the number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the size of the list (`n`) and the sizes of the three sublists (`n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`). It then reads the list of integers (`x`) and sorts it in reverse order. The function divides the sorted list into three sublists according to the specified sizes. After division, it checks if the sums of the elements in these sublists satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`). If the condition holds, it prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the three sublists on separate lines. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function ensures that the input constraints are met and handles all valid test cases according to the described logic. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the input constraints are violated, but the function will only proceed if the constraints are satisfied.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sums of the three groups can form a triangle with a positive area after sorting the array in descending order and splitting it into three groups. This approach might not always yield valid triangle sides.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
6 2 2 2
1 1 1 1 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
1 1 
1 1 
1 1 
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program sorts the array in descending order, which may not guarantee that the sums of the three groups can form a valid triangle. For instance, in the example above, sorting `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]` in descending order gives `[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Splitting this into `[3, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1]` results in sums `4`, `2`, and `2`, which do not satisfy the triangle inequality (`4 + 2 > 2`, `2 + 2 > 4` is false).

To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that the sums of the three groups satisfy the triangle inequality conditions after splitting the array in any valid manner, not just by sorting in descending order.
