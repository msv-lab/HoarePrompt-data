Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the input as specified, including the number of test cases, and processes each test case individually.
2. It sorts the list of numbers in descending order before splitting them into three groups. This helps in ensuring that larger numbers are considered first when forming the groups, which is beneficial for forming a triangle since the triangle inequality must hold.
3. The program splits the sorted list into three parts based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.
4. It calculates the sum of each group and checks if the sums satisfy the triangle inequality (i.e., `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`).
5. If the triangle inequality is satisfied, it prints "YES" followed by the elements of each group. If not, it prints "NO".

Given these points, the logic in the program seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
