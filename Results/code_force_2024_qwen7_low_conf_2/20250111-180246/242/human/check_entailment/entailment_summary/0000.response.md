Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the verification process:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers (`x`) is sorted in reverse order before being divided into three groups. Sorting in reverse helps ensure that larger numbers are considered first when checking the triangle inequality, which can be beneficial in some cases but is not strictly necessary for correctness.

3. **Group Division**: The program splits the sorted list into three groups based on the specified sizes (`n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`). This is done correctly using slicing operations.

4. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The program checks the triangle inequality conditions (`sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`) after splitting the list into groups. This check is crucial and implemented correctly.

5. **Output**: If the triangle inequality conditions are satisfied, the program prints 'YES' followed by the elements of the three groups. If not, it prints 'NO'. This output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given that the program handles all aspects of the problem as described and meets the input constraints, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
