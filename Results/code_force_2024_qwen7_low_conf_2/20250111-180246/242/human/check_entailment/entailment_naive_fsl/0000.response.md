Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sums of the three groups can form a triangle with a positive area after sorting the array in descending order and splitting it into three groups. This approach might not always yield valid triangle sides.

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
4
6 2 2 2
1 1 1 1 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
1 1 
1 1 
1 1 
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program sorts the array in descending order, which may not guarantee that the sums of the three groups can form a valid triangle. For instance, in the example above, sorting `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3]` in descending order gives `[3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Splitting this into `[3, 1]`, `[1, 1]`, and `[1, 1]` results in sums `4`, `2`, and `2`, which do not satisfy the triangle inequality (`4 + 2 > 2`, `2 + 2 > 4` is false).

To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that the sums of the three groups satisfy the triangle inequality conditions after splitting the array in any valid manner, not just by sorting in descending order.
