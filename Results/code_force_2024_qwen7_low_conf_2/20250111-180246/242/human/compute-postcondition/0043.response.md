The code `sum_b = sum(group_b)` calculates the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b` and assigns it to `sum_b`. Since `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`, and the initial state already defines `sum_b` as the sum of the elements in this sublist, the value of `sum_b` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `t` is `t - 1`; `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is unchanged; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive); `sum_a` is unchanged**
