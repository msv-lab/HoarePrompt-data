`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer obtained from user input. The values of `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and the list `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100,000, and `t` is now the integer input by the user; `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c` are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 1 ≤ n_a, n_b, n_c ≤ n-2, and n_a + n_b + n_c = n; the list of integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n satisfies 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.**
