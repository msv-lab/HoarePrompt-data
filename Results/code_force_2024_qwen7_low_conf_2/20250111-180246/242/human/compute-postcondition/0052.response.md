The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it appears that the function should operate on a set of values that are not passed as parameters but are presumably defined within the function's scope or as global variables.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\).
- For each test case, `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, and `n_c` are integers satisfying \(3 \leq n \leq 200,000\) and \(1 \leq n_a, n_b, n_c \leq n-2\) with \(n_a + n_b + n_c = n\).
- The list of integers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) satisfies \(1 \leq x_i \leq 10^9\), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

Since the function does not accept any parameters, the return value must be inferred from the problem description. Typically, such functions return a result based on the processed data, but without seeing the actual implementation, we cannot specify what exactly the function returns.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process a series of test cases based on the provided constraints, where each test case involves values of `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and a list of integers `x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n`.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases based on given constraints involving integers `n`, `n_a`, `n_b`, `n_c`, and a list of integers `x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n`.**
