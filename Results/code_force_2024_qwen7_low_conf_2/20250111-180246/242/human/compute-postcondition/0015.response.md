The code `print(' '.join(map(str, group_c)))` prints the elements of `group_c` joined by spaces. This does not change the values of any variables, but it does affect the output of the program. The output will be the elements of `group_c` joined by spaces.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\); `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; the sums satisfy the conditions: `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c`, `sum_b + sum_c > sum_a`, and `sum_c + sum_a > sum_b`; the output is the elements of `group_c` joined by spaces.**
