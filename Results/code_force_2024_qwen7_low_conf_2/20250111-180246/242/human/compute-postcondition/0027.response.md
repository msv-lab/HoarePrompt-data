The code `sum_b = sum(group_b)` calculates the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b` and assigns this sum to the variable `sum_b`. Given that `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, the sum of its elements is already stored in `sum_b` before this line of code. This line of code does not change the value of `sum_b`, but it ensures that `sum_b` is recalculated and updated to the current sum of the elements in `group_b`.

Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `na` is an integer from the input, `nb` is an integer from the input, `nc` is an integer from the input, `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end.**
