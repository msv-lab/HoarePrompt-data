To ensure that the loop can execute for each test case, we need to consider the variable `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The loop will run `t` times, so for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments step by step:

1. **Variable `t`:**
   - The problem states that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\).
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
   
2. **List of Test Cases:**
   - Since `t` represents the number of test cases, there must be at least one test case for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, the list of test cases (or the actual data that will be processed within each loop iteration) must be prepared or initialized appropriately.

Given the above considerations, the state before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and `t` must be greater than 0.**

This ensures that the loop can execute at least once for each valid test case.
