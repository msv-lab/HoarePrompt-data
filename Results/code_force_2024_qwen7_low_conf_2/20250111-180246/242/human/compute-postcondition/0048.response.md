The code `print(' '.join(map(str, group_c)))` does not affect the values of the variables directly. Instead, it prints the elements of `group_c` separated by spaces to the console. Since the output is displayed to the console and not stored as a variable, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The only change is that `group_c` is printed.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `t` is `t - 1`; `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is unchanged; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive); `group_c` is printed to the console.**
