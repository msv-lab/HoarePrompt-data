`sum_c` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `sum_c` is not defined before, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`. The value of `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in `group_c`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\); `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`.**
