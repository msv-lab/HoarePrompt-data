Postcondition: ***`x` is sorted in descending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `na` is an integer from the input, `nb` is an integer from the input, `nc` is an integer from the input, `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end. If the condition `sum_a + sum_b > sum_c and sum_b + sum_c > sum_a and (sum_c + sum_a > sum_b)` is satisfied, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
