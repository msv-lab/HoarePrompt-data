`x` is sorted in reverse order, meaning the list is sorted from highest to lowest. Since `x` was initially a list of integers obtained from input, after sorting, the first element of `x` will be the largest integer in the original list, the second element will be the second largest, and so on. The variables `t`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.**
