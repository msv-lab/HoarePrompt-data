The code snippet `group_b = x[na:na + nb]` creates a slice of the list `x` starting from index `na` up to (but not including) index `na + nb`. Since `x` is initially sorted in reverse order, the elements in `x` are in descending order.

- `group_b` is assigned the slice of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`.
- The other variables remain unchanged: `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\), `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain integers, and `x` remains a list of integers sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\); `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`.**
