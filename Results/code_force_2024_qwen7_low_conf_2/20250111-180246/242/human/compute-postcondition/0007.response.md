The code assigns the sublist of `x` starting from index `na + nb` to `group_c`. This means `group_c` now contains the elements of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\).
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers.
- `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.
- `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`.
- `group_c` is now the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\); `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`.**
