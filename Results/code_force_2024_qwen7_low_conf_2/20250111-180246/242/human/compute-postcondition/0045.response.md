The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply prints 'YES' to the console. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `t` is `t - 1`; `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is unchanged; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive); `sum_c` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `YES` is printed to the console.**
