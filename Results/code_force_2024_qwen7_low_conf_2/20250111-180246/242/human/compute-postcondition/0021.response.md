The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `x`. This means the list `x` is now updated with new values based on the user's input, while the other variables (`na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_b`, `group_c`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`) remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `na` is an integer from the input, `nb` is an integer from the input, `nc` is an integer from the input, `x` is a list of integers updated based on user input, `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`.**
