The code snippet `print(' '.join(map(str, group_b)))` prints the elements of the list `group_b` separated by spaces. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it only prints them.

- `x` remains sorted in descending order.
- `t`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_b`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain unchanged.
- `group_c` remains the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end.
- `sum_a` is still the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`.

Since the code does not modify any variables, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `na` is an integer from the input, `nb` is an integer from the input, `nc` is an integer from the input, `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end**.
