The code prints the elements of `group_b` separated by spaces. Since the printing operation does not change any variable values, the only change is the output to the console. The output state remains the same except for the printed content.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `t` is `t - 1`; `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is unchanged; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive); `group_b` is printed to the console.**
