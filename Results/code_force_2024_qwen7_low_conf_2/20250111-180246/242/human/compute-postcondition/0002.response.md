`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means each of these variables will hold an integer value obtained from the input, separated by spaces. The variable `t` remains unchanged because it was not mentioned in the assignment.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
