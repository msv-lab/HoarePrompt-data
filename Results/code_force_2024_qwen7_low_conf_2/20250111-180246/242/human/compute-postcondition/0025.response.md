The code `group_c = x[na + nb:]` assigns the sublist of `x` starting from index `na + nb` to the variable `group_c`. This does not change the values of the other variables but updates the value of `group_c`.

- `x` is sorted in descending order.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\).
- `na` is an integer from the input.
- `nb` is an integer from the input.
- `nc` is an integer from the input.
- `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`.
- `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive).
- `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`.
- `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`.
- After executing the code, `group_c` now refers to the sublist of `x` starting from index `na + nb` to the end.
