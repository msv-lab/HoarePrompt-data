The code reads a line of input split by spaces and converts each element into an integer, storing them in a list `x`. The values of `t`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated list `x` and the unchanged values of `t`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and `t` must be greater than 0; `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
