The code `sum_a = sum(group_a)` calculates the sum of the elements in `group_a` (which is a sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`) and assigns this sum to the variable `sum_a`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `na`, `nb`, and the elements of `x`, so we can only express the final state in terms of these variables.

- `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in any operation.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain unchanged since they are not used in the code snippet.
- `x` remains unchanged as no elements of the list are modified or removed.
- `group_b` and `group_c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
- `sum_a` is assigned the sum of the elements in `group_a`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t > 0\); `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers; `x` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`.**
