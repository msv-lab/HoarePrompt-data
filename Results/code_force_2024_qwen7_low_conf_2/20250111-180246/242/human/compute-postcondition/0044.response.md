`sum_c` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`. The value of `group_c` is from index `na + nb` to the end of the list `x`. Since the list `x` is sorted in descending order, the sum of the elements in `group_c` does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `t` is `t - 1`; `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is unchanged; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive); `sum_c` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers sorted in descending order; `t` is `t - 1`; `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb - 1`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is unchanged; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer; `group_a` is the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive); `sum_c` is equal to the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end.**
