The code `n, na, nb, nc = map(int, input().split())` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. 

- The initial state was that `x` is sorted in descending order, `t` is `t - 1`, and `t` must satisfy \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\). 
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers from the input.

After running the code, the variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` will be updated with the values provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order, `t` is `t - 1`, `t` must satisfy \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `na` is an input integer, `nb` is an input integer, `nc` is an input integer, `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end, `n` is an input integer**
