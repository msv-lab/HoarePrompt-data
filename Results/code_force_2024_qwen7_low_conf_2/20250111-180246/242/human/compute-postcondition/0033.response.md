The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is sorted in descending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `na` is an integer from the input, `nb` is an integer from the input, `nc` is an integer from the input, `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`, `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`, `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`, `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`, `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end. 'NO' is printed.**
