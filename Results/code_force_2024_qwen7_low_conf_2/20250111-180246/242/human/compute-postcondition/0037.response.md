The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input and converts each integer into an integer type using the `map` function, then converts the map object into a list. This list overwrites the existing `x`. Since the exact values of the input integers are not specified, we denote them as `input_integers`.

- `x` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_b`, `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, `group_c`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers derived from the input; `t` is `t - 1`, `t` must satisfy \(1 \leq t \leq 100,000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\); `na` is an input integer; `nb` is an input integer; `nc` is an input integer; `group_b` is the sublist of `x` from index `na` to `na + nb`; `sum_a` is the sum of the elements in the sublist of `x` from index `0` to `na` (exclusive) and is equal to `sum_b`; `sum_b` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_b`; `sum_c` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `group_c`; `group_c` is the sublist of `x` from index `na + nb` to the end; `n` is an input integer**
