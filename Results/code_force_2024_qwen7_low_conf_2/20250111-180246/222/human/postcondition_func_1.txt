The function reads a series of test cases from standard input where each test case consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent `r` values to process, followed by `t` integers `r` such that `1 <= r <= 10^5`. For each `r`, it calls `func_1(r)`, converts the result to a string, and appends it to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line, using `'\n'.join(results)`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value explicitly, but its primary output is printed to the standard output. Potential edge cases include when `t` or `r` values are outside their specified ranges, which would raise a `ValueError`. However, the code does not handle these cases explicitly.
