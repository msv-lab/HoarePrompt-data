#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 * r * r, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `r` such that 1 ≤ r ≤ 10^5. It calculates and returns the value 3 * r * r. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code. The function correctly performs the calculation and returns the result without any issues within the specified range.
