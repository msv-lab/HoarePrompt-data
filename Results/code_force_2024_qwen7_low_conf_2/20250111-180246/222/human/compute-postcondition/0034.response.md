`y_min_sq` is assigned the value of `r_squared - x_squared`. The value of `x_squared` is `x * x`, and the value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x_squared` is `x * x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged; `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x_squared`.

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged; `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x_squared`.**
