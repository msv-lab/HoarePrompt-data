Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\) or \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\); `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\) or \(4r - 1\); `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{2r - 1})\); `count` is increased by 2, 4, or `count + (math.floor(\sqrt{4r - 1}) * 2 + 1)`.***
