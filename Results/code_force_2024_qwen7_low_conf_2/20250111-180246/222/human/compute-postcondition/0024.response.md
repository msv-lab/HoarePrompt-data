Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\); `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\); `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\). If `y_min_sq > y_max_sq`, the condition remains unmodified. Since there is no else part, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.***
