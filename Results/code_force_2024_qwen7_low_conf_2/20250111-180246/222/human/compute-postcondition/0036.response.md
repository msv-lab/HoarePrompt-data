The `continue` statement in the given code does not affect any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and continues to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `x_squared`, `y_min_sq`, and `y_max_sq` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x * x`, `y_max_sq` is `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`**
