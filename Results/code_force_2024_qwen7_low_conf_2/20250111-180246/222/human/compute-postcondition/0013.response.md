According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
- `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`
- `index` is 4
- `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1])), str(func_1(r))]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `t` should be decremented by 1.

Let's update the states:
- `t` will be `t - 1`
- `r` remains unchanged
- `index` remains unchanged
- `results` remains unchanged

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `index` is 4, `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1])), str(func_1(r))]`
