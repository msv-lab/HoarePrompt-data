Postcondition: ***`x_squared` is `x * x`, `x` remains unchanged, `y_max_sq` is `r + 1` squared minus `x * x` minus 1, `y_max` is the floor of the square root of `r + 1` squared minus `x * x` minus 1, `count` is `count` plus the maximum of 0 and `y_max - y_min + 1` times 2, or `count` is updated by adding `y_max * 2 + 1` to its current value, depending on whether `x_squared` is less than `r_squared`.***
