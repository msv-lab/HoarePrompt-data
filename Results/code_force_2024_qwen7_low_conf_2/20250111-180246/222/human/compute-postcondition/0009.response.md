According to the code, the loop runs `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
- `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`
- `index` is 2
- `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1])))`

The loop will continue if `index` is less than `t`. Since `index` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `index` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, `results` should be updated based on the loop's iteration.

Since the loop body is omitted, we can't determine exactly what changes occur within the loop body. However, we know that `index` must be incremented and `results` must be updated to reflect the next iteration.

Let's assume that the loop body appends a new value to `results` each time it runs. Therefore, after the next iteration, `results` would contain one more element.

State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `index` is 3, `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1]))), ... (next element appended here)`**
