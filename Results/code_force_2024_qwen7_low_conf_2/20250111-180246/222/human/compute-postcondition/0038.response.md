The code snippet calculates the square root of `y_min_sq` and assigns the ceiling value to `y_min` if `y_min_sq` is greater than 0, otherwise assigns 0 to `y_min`. Given the precondition that `y_min_sq` is greater than `y_max_sq`, let's proceed step by step.

1. Since `y_min_sq` is greater than `y_max_sq`, the condition `y_min_sq > 0` is true.
2. Calculate the square root of `y_min_sq` using `math.sqrt(y_min_sq)` and then apply `math.ceil` to round up to the nearest integer.
3. Assign the result to `y_min`.

Therefore, the updated state includes `y_min` being set to the ceiling value of the square root of `y_min_sq`, while `x_squared`, `y_min_sq`, and `y_max_sq` remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x * x`, `y_max_sq` is `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`, `y_min` is `math.ceil(math.sqrt(r_squared - x * x))`**
