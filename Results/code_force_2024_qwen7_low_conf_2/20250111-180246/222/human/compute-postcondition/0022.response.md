The code snippet updates the value of `y_max_sq` to be `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\), which simplifies to \(r^2 + 2r + 1\).
2. `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\), which simplifies to \(r^2 - 2r + 1\).

So, `y_max_sq` becomes:
\[ r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1 = (r^2 + 2r + 1) - (r^2 - 2r + 1) - 1 \]
Simplifying this:
\[ = r^2 + 2r + 1 - r^2 + 2r - 1 - 1 \]
\[ = 4r - 1 \]

Therefore, the new value of `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\). All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\); `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\); `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\)**
