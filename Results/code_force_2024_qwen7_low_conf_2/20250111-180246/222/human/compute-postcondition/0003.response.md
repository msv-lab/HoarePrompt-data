The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `index`. The initial values of `t` and `r` remain unchanged, and `data` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= \(10^5\), and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= \(10^5\), `index` is 1**
