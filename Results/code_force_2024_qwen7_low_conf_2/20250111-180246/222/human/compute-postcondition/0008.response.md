`results` is appended with the string representation of the value returned by `func_1(r)`. The initial state indicates that `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`. Since `func_1(r)` is called and its string representation is appended to `results`, the value of `results` changes. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `r` also remains unchanged as it is passed to `func_1` but not reassigned. The value of `index` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The value of `data` is not provided in the initial state, so it cannot be further analyzed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `index` is 2, `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1])))`**
