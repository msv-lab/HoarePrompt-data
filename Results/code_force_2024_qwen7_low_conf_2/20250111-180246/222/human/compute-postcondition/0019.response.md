The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the definition `def func_2():`. Based on the provided output cases, the function likely processes some internal state or external input data related to test cases and their respective values of `r`.

However, since no specific return values or conditions are detailed, we can infer that the function might return some kind of result or collection of results based on the processing of the test cases and their corresponding `r` values.

Given the structure of the prompt, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, but processes a series of test cases with associated `r` values (where 1 <= r <= 10^5) and returns a result based on the test cases and their `r` values.**
