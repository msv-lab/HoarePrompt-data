The code assigns the value of `math.floor(math.sqrt(y_max_sq))` to `y_max`. Given the initial state:

- `x_squared` is `x * x`
- `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x * x`
- `y_max_sq` is `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`
- `y_min` is `math.ceil(math.sqrt(r_squared - x * x))`

We can deduce that `y_max_sq` is calculated as `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`. Taking the square root of `y_max_sq` and applying `math.floor` will give us the integer part of the square root of `y_max_sq`.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x * x`, `y_max_sq` is `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`, `y_min` is `math.ceil(math.sqrt(r_squared - x * x))`, `y_max` is `math.floor(math.sqrt((r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1))`**
