The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `r`. `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5. After executing the function body, the function returns `count`, which is the sum of all increments made during the loop execution based on the conditions inside the loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `r` within the specified range and return the sum of all increments made during the loop execution.
