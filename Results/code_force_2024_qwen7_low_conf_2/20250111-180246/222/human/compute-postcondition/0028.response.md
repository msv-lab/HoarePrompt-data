Let's go through the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `r` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \)
   - `count` is either \( 2 \cdot \max(0, y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1) \) if \( x^2 < r^2 \) or \( y_{\text{max}} \cdot 2 + 1 \) otherwise
   - `r_squared` is \( r \times r \)
   - `r_plus_1_squared` is \( (r + 1) \times (r + 1) \)
   - `x` is \(-r + 1\)
   - `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\)
   - `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\)
   - `y_max_sq` is \( 2r \)

2. **Code Execution:**
   ```python
   y_max_sq = r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis:**
   - The right-hand side of the equation involves the variables `r_plus_1_squared` and `x_squared`.
   - We need to substitute the values of these variables into the equation.
     - `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
     - `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\).

4. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   - Calculate `r_plus_1_squared`:
     \[
     r_plus_1_squared = (r + 1) \times (r + 1) = r^2 + 2r + 1
     \]
   - Calculate `x_squared`:
     \[
     x_squared = (r - 1)^2 = r^2 - 2r + 1
     \]
   - Substitute these into the equation for `y_max_sq`:
     \[
     y_max_sq = r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1 = (r^2 + 2r + 1) - (r^2 - 2r + 1) - 1 = r^2 + 2r + 1 - r^2 + 2r - 1 - 1 = 4r - 1
     \]

5. **Update the Values:**
   - `y_max_sq` is updated to \( 4r - 1 \).

6. **Output State:**
   - All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
   - `y_max_sq` is now \( 4r - 1 \).

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \); `count` is either \( 2 \cdot \max(0, y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1) \) if \( x^2 < r^2 \) or \( y_{\text{max}} \cdot 2 + 1 \) otherwise; `r_squared` is \( r \times r \); `r_plus_1_squared` is \( (r + 1) \times (r + 1) \); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\); `y_max_sq` is \( 4r - 1 \)**
