The code `count += y_max * 2 + 1 if y_max >= 0 else 0` updates the value of `count` based on the condition whether `y_max` is non-negative. Let's break it down:

- If `y_max` is non-negative (`y_max >= 0`), then `count` is updated by adding `y_max * 2 + 1` to its current value.
- If `y_max` is negative (`y_max < 0`), then `count` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `x_squared` is `x * x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged.
- `y_max_sq` is `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`.
- `y_max` is `math.floor(math.sqrt(r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1))`.

Since `y_max` is derived from `y_max_sq`, and `y_max` is a floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`, `y_max` will be non-negative as long as `y_max_sq` is non-negative.

Thus, the condition `if y_max >= 0` will be true, and `count` will be updated by adding `y_max * 2 + 1` to its current value.

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged; `y_max_sq` is `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`; `y_max` is `math.floor(math.sqrt(r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1)); count` is updated by adding `y_max * 2 + 1` to its current value.**
