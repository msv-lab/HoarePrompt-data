First, let's break down the initial state and the code step-by-step.

Initial State:
- `r` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \)
- `count` is either \( 2 \cdot \max(0, y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1) \) if \( x^2 < r^2 \) or \( y_{\text{max}} \cdot 2 + 1 \) otherwise
- `r_squared` is \( r \times r \)
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \( (r + 1) \times (r + 1) \)
- `x` is \(-r + 1\)
- `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\)
- `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\)
- `y_max_sq` is \( 2r \)

Code:
```
y_min_sq = r_squared - x_squared
```

Let's calculate the value of `y_min_sq` using the initial values:

1. `r_squared` is \( r \times r \).
2. `x` is \(-r + 1\), so `x_squared` is \((-r + 1)^2 = r^2 - 2r + 1\).

Thus, `y_min_sq` is calculated as:
\[ y_min_sq = r^2 - (r^2 - 2r + 1) = r^2 - r^2 + 2r - 1 = 2r - 1 \]

Now, let's update the values of the variables in the output state:

- `r_squared` remains unchanged: \( r \times r \)
- `r_plus_1_squared` remains unchanged: \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
- `x` remains unchanged: \(-r + 1\)
- `x_squared` remains unchanged: \( (r - 1)^2 \)
- `y_max` remains unchanged: \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\)
- `y_max_sq` remains unchanged: \( 2r \)
- `y_min_sq` is now \( 2r - 1 \)

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \); `r_squared` is \( r \times r \); `r_plus_1_squared` is \( (r + 1) \times (r + 1) \); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\); `y_max_sq` is \( 2r \); `y_min_sq` is \( 2r - 1 \)**
