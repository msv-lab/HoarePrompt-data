The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r`. Since `index` is 1, `r` is assigned the second element of the list `data`, which is converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list []**
