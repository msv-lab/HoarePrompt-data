The code snippet calculates the value of `y_min` based on the condition `y_min_sq > 0`. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The initial state includes the following variables:
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
   - `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
   - `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
   - `x` is \(-r + 1\)
   - `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\)
   - `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\)
   - `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\)
   - `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\)

2. The code sets `y_min` to:
   - `math.ceil(math.sqrt(y_min_sq))` if `y_min_sq > 0`
   - `0` otherwise

Since `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\) and \(r\) is at least 1, \(y_min_sq\) is also at least 1. Therefore, `y_min_sq > 0` is always true.

3. So, `y_min` is set to `math.ceil(math.sqrt(2r - 1))`.

4. The value of `y_min_sq` is updated to \(2r - 1\), and `y_min` is now the ceiling of the square root of `y_min_sq`.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\); `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\); `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\); `y_min` is `math.ceil(math.sqrt(2r - 1))`.**
