`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. Given that `index` is 3, this means `r` is now assigned the value of `int(data[3])`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `index` is 3, `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1]))), ... (next element appended here)`**
