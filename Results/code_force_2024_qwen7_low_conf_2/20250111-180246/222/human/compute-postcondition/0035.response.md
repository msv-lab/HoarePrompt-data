`y_max_sq` is assigned the value `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`. From the initial state, we know `x_squared` is `x * x` and `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x_squared`. The value of `x` remains unchanged.

Let's calculate the new value of `y_max_sq`:

- `x_squared` is `x * x`
- `r_plus_1_squared` is `(r + 1) * (r + 1)`
- Therefore, `y_max_sq` becomes `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`

So, the updated values are:
- `x_squared` is still `x * x`
- `y_min_sq` is still `r_squared - x * x`
- `y_max_sq` is now `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, `y_min_sq` is `r_squared - x * x`, `y_max_sq` is `(r + 1) * (r + 1) - x * x - 1`**
