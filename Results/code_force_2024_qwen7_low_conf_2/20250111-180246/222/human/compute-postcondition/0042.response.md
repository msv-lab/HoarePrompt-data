`y_max_sq` is defined as `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`. The code calculates `y_max` by taking the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`. This means `y_max` will be the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of `y_max_sq`.

Since the exact value of `r_plus_1_squared` is not given, let's denote it as `r_plus_1_squared`. Therefore, `y_max_sq` is `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`.

After executing the code, `y_max` will be updated to the value of the floor of the square root of `y_max_sq`.

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged; `y_max_sq` is `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`; `y_max` is `math.floor(math.sqrt(r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1))`**
