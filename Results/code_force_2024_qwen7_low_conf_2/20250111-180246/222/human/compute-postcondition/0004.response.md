The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `data`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `index` is updated to 1. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and the new list `results`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= r <= \(10^5\), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list []**
