Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
- `index` is 1
- `results` is an empty list `[]`

### Loop Code:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results.append(str(func_1(r)))
```

### Analysis of the Loop Execution:
1. **First Iteration:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as `t` is used as the upper limit of the loop.
   - `r` is set to `int(data[index])`, so `r` becomes `int(data[1])`.
   - `index` increases by 1, so `index` becomes 2.
   - `results` appends `str(func_1(int(data[1])))`.

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `r` is set to `int(data[index])`, so `r` becomes `int(data[3])`.
   - `index` increases by 1, so `index` becomes 4.
   - `results` appends `str(func_1(int(data[3])))`.

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `t` decreases by 1 because we have completed one iteration.
   - `r` is set to `int(data[index])`, so `r` becomes `int(data[4])`.
   - `index` increases by 1, so `index` becomes 5.
   - `results` appends `str(func_1(int(data[4])))`.

### General Pattern:
- Each iteration sets `r` to the next element in the `data` list (starting from `data[index]` and incrementing `index` by 1 each time).
- `results` appends the result of `func_1(r)` for each iteration.
- After each iteration, `t` decreases by 1 until `t` becomes 0.

### Final State:
- When the loop finishes, `t` will be 0 because it starts at `int(data[0])` and decreases by 1 with each iteration.
- `index` will be `1 + t * 2` because `index` starts at 1 and increases by 2 with each iteration (1 for setting `r` and 1 for the next element in the list).
- `results` will contain the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` value processed, where `r` is `int(data[i])` for `i` ranging from `1` to `1 + (t-1) * 2`.

### Conclusion:
- If the loop executes `t` times, the final state will be:
  - `t` is 0.
  - `index` is `1 + t * 2`.
  - `results` is a list containing the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` in the specified range.

### Output State:
Output State: **`t` is 0, `index` is 1 + t * 2, `results` is a list containing the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` in the range from `int(data[1])` to `int(data[1 + (t-1) * 2])`.**
