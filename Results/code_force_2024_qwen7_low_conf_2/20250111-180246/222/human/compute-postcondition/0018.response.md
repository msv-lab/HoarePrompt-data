Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `index` is calculated as `1 + t * 2`, which is `1 + 0 * 2 = 1`.
   - `results` is a list containing the string representations of `func_1(r)` for each `r` in the range from `int(data[1])` to `int(data[1 + (t-1) * 2])`. Since `t` is 0, the range is from `int(data[1])` to `int(data[1 + (0-1) * 2])`, which simplifies to `int(data[1])` to `int(data[1 - 0])` or `int(data[1])` to `int(data[1])`. This means `results` contains one element, which is `func_1(int(data[1]))`.

2. The code then prints each element of `results` separated by a newline using `'\n'.join(results)`. 

Given the initial state, `results` is `[func_1(int(data[1]))]`.

Therefore, the output will be:
```
func_1(int(data[1]))
```

Since the code only prints the elements of `results` and does not change any of the variables, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `index` is 1, `results` is ['func_1(int(data[1]))']**
