Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `r` such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\). It calculates and returns the sum of all increments made during the loop execution based on specific conditions. The function iterates over each integer `x` from \(-r\) to \(r\) and checks the following conditions to increment the `count` variable:

1. For each `x`, it calculates `x_squared`, `y_min_sq`, and `y_max_sq`.
2. If `x_squared` is less than `r_squared`, it computes `y_min` and `y_max` and updates `count` based on their difference.
3. If `x_squared` is greater than or equal to `r_squared`, it directly computes `y_max` and updates `count`.

After completing the loop, the function returns the final value of `count`. Potential edge cases include the boundary values of `r` (i.e., when `r` is 1 or \(10^5\)), and the function correctly handles these cases by iterating through all possible `x` values within the specified range.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including all relevant conditions and edge cases.
