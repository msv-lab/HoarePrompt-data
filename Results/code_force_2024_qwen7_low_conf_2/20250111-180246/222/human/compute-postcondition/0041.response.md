`y_max_sq` is assigned the value `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`. The value of `x_squared` is `x * x`, and `x` remains unchanged. The value of `r_plus_1_squared` is unknown, but the equation for `y_max_sq` is defined.

Output State: **`x_squared` is `x * x`, the value of `x` remains unchanged; `y_max_sq` is `r_plus_1_squared - x_squared - 1`**
