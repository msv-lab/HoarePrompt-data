Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all possible iterations.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `r_squared` is initialized to \(r \times r\).
   - `r_plus_1_squared` is initialized to \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` in the range \([-r, r]\).
   - For each `x`, `x_squared` is calculated as \(x \times x\).
   - The conditions inside the loop depend on the comparison between `x_squared` and `r_squared` and `r_plus_1_squared`.

3. **Key Conditions:**
   - If \(x^2 < r^2\):
     - Calculate \(y_{\text{min_sq}} = r^2 - x^2\).
     - Calculate \(y_{\text{max_sq}} = (r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).
     - Ensure \(y_{\text{min_sq}} \leq y_{\text{max_sq}}\).
     - Calculate \(y_{\text{min}} = \lceil \sqrt{y_{\text{min_sq}}} \rceil\) if \(y_{\text{min_sq}} > 0\).
     - Calculate \(y_{\text{max}} = \lfloor \sqrt{y_{\text{max_sq}}} \rfloor\).
     - Update `count` by adding \(2 \cdot \max(0, y_{\text{max}} - y_{\text{min}} + 1)\).

   - If \(x^2 \geq r^2\):
     - Calculate \(y_{\text{max_sq}} = (r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).
     - Calculate \(y_{\text{max}} = \lfloor \sqrt{y_{\text{max_sq}}} \rfloor\).
     - Update `count` by adding \(2y_{\text{max}} + 1\) if \(y_{\text{max}} \geq 0\).

### Final State After All Iterations

- The loop will iterate over all `x` from \(-r\) to \(r\).
- The final value of `count` will be the sum of all increments made during each iteration.
- Since the loop processes every `x` in the range, the final value of `count` will be the result of all calculations performed within the loop.

### Output State

Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all iterations is:

**Output State:**
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
- `count` is the sum of all increments made during the loop execution based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\).
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x` will take on each value from \(-r\) to \(r\) exactly once.
- `x_squared` will take on each value from \(0\) to \(r^2\) exactly once.
- `y_max` will be the largest integer \(y\) such that \(y^2 \leq (r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).
- `y_min` will be the smallest integer \(y\) such that \(y^2 \geq r^2 - x^2\).

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State:**
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\).
- `count` is the sum of all increments based on the conditions inside the loop.
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\).
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\).
- `x` takes on each value from \(-r\) to \(r\).
- `x_squared` takes on each value from \(0\) to \(r^2\).
- `y_max` is the largest integer such that \(y^2 \leq (r + 1)^2 - x^2 - 1\).
- `y_min` is the smallest integer such that \(y^2 \geq r^2 - x^2\).
