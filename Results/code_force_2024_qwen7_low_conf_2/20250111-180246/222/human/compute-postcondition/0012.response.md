`results` is a list that appends the string representation of the function `func_1(r)` to its end. The value of `r` is `int(data[3])`. The previous state of `results` was `[str(func_1(int(data[1]))), ... (next element appended here)`. After appending, the new state of `results` will include the additional element `str(func_1(r))`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[3])`, `index` is 4, `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1])), str(func_1(r))]**
