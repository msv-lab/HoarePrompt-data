The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged after executing this statement.

Output State: **`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(-r + 1\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\); `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\); `y_min_sq` is \(2r - 1\)**
