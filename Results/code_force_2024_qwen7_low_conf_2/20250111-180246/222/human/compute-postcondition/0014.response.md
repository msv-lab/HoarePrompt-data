`r` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. Given that `index` is 4, this means `r` is now set to `int(data[4])`. The values of `t`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0]) - 1`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[4])`, `index` is 4, `results` is `[str(func_1(int(data[1])), str(func_1(int(data[3])))]`
