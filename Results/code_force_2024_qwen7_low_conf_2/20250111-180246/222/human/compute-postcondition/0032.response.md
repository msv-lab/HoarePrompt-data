Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `x` from `-r` to `r + 1`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop condition depends on the value of `x`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
   - `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
   - `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
   - `x` is \(-r + 1\), meaning the previous value of `x` was \(-r\)
   - `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\)
   - `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\) or \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\)
   - `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\) or \(4r - 1\)
   - `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{2r - 1})\)
   - `count` is increased by 2, 4, or `count + (math.floor(\sqrt{4r - 1}) * 2 + 1)`

3. **Update the Variables for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `x` from `-r` to `r + 1`, the next value of `x` would be \(-r + 1 + 1 = 0\).
   - All other variables (`r`, `r_squared`, `r_plus_1_squared`, `x_squared`, `y_max`, `y_max_sq`, `y_min`, `count`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.

4. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `r` remains the same.
   - `r_squared` remains the same.
   - `r_plus_1_squared` remains the same.
   - `x` is now `0`.
   - `x_squared` is now \((r - 1)^2\).
   - `y_max` remains the same.
   - `y_max_sq` remains the same.
   - `y_min` remains the same.
   - `count` remains the same.

Given this information, we can construct the updated state.

**State:**
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\)
- `r_squared` is \(r \times r\)
- `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\)
- `x` is \(0\)
- `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\)
- `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\) or \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\)
- `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\) or \(4r - 1\)
- `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{2r - 1})\)
- `count` remains the same

**State:**
**`r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 10^5\); `r_squared` is \(r \times r\); `r_plus_1_squared` is \((r + 1) \times (r + 1)\); `x` is \(0\); `x_squared` is \((r - 1)^2\); `y_max` is \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{2r})\) or \(\text{math.floor}(\sqrt{4r - 1})\); `y_max_sq` is \(4r - 1\) or \(4r - 1\); `y_min` is \(\text{math.ceil}(\sqrt{2r - 1})\); `count` is increased by 2, 4, or `count + (math.floor(\sqrt{4r - 1}) * 2 + 1)`**
