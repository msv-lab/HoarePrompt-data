The code increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial value of `index` is 1, so after the increment, `index` becomes 2. The values of other variables (`t`, `r`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `r` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list []**
