The code calculates the value of `y_max` using the formula `math.floor(math.sqrt(y_max_sq))`. Given that `y_max_sq` is initially `4r - 1`, we substitute this into the formula:

1. `y_max_sq` is `4r - 1`.
2. Calculate the square root of `y_max_sq`: `math.sqrt(4r - 1)`.
3. Apply the floor function to get the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `4r - 1`.

Since `y_max` is now calculated as `math.floor(math.sqrt(4r - 1))`, the value of `y_max` is determined by the floor of the square root of `4r - 1`.

Output State: **`y_max` is `math.floor(math.sqrt(4r - 1))`, `y_max_sq` is `4r - 1`**
