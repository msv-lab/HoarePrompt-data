Reasoning: 
The given program is supposed to calculate the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to \( r \) but strictly less than \( r+1 \). However, the provided implementation of the `func_1` function simply returns \( 3 \times r \times r \), which is incorrect for this specific problem.

The correct approach to solving this problem involves understanding the geometry of the situation. For a given radius \( r \), the number of lattice points inside a circle of radius \( r+1 \) but outside a circle of radius \( r \) can be derived from the properties of Pythagorean triples. Specifically, the number of such lattice points is given by the formula \( 8 \times \lfloor r \rfloor - 4 \) when \( r \) is an integer, but it needs a more detailed analysis for non-integer values of \( r \).

However, the given function simply returns \( 3 \times r \times r \), which does not match the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
