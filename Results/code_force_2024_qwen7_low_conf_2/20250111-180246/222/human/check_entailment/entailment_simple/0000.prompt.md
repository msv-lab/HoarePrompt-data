You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Given an integer r , find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean
distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to r but strictly less than r+1 .

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. The Euclidean distance
from (0, 0) to the point (x,y) is \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer r (1 \leq r \leq
10^5 ).

The sum of r over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of lattice points
that have an Euclidean distance d from (0, 0) such that r \leq d < r+1 .

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    r = int(input())
    print(func_1(r))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5.
def func_1(r):
    return 3 * r * r
    #The program returns 3 * r * r, where r is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 10^5

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
