Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem statement.

1. **Problem Understanding**: We need to find the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that the Euclidean distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, y)\) satisfies \(r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r+1\). This means the lattice points must lie within a ring between two circles centered at \((0, 0)\) with radii \(r\) and \(r+1\).

2. **Lattice Points in the Ring**:
   - For any given radius \(r\), the number of lattice points can be approximated by the area of the annulus (ring) between the two circles minus the area that isn't fully covered by lattice points.
   - The area of the annulus is approximately \(\pi \cdot ((r+1)^2 - r^2) = \pi \cdot (2r + 1)\).
   - However, since we are counting lattice points, the actual count will be slightly less due to the discrete nature of points.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` currently returns `3 * r * r`, which is not consistent with the expected behavior.
   - Let's calculate the expected number of lattice points for a few values of \(r\):
     - For \(r = 1\): The circle radius is 1, so the annulus is between radius 1 and 2. The exact count is 8 (the points (±1, ±1), (±2, 0), (0, ±2)).
     - For \(r = 2\): The circle radius is 2, so the annulus is between radius 2 and 3. The exact count is 16 (the points (±2, ±1), (±1, ±2), (±3, 0), (0, ±3)).
     - For \(r = 3\): The circle radius is 3, so the annulus is between radius 3 and 4. The exact count is 20 (similar pattern as above but more points).

4. **Verification**:
   - The formula `3 * r * r` does not match the exact count of lattice points for any \(r\). It appears to be an overestimation.
   - A correct formula would involve more complex geometric considerations, typically involving the floor functions and the structure of the grid.

Since the provided function `func_1(r)` returns an incorrect count of lattice points for the given test cases, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
