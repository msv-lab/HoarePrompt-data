Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem statement and the given function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

### Problem Statement Recap
The problem requires us to count the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie within the annular region defined by two concentric circles centered at the origin (0, 0) with radii \( r \) and \( r+1 \).

### Given Function Summary
The function `func_1` is described as calculating and returning the value \( 3 * r * r \). However, the original assessment suggests that this function is incorrect because the correct number of lattice points should be calculated differently. Specifically, the correct formula for the number of lattice points in the annulus is:

\[ \text{Points} = 4 \times (\lfloor r \rfloor + \lfloor r \rfloor - 1) \]

### Analysis of the Provided Program
The program reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the radius `r` and calls the function `func_1(r)`, printing the result.

### Correct Calculation
To verify the correctness of the provided function, let's manually compute the number of lattice points for some values of `r` using both the provided function and the correct formula:

- For \( r = 1 \):
  - Provided function: \( 3 * 1 * 1 = 3 \)
  - Correct formula: \( 4 \times (1 + 1 - 1) = 4 \times 1 = 4 \)
  
- For \( r = 2 \):
  - Provided function: \( 3 * 2 * 2 = 12 \)
  - Correct formula: \( 4 \times (2 + 2 - 1) = 4 \times 3 = 12 \)
  
- For \( r = 3 \):
  - Provided function: \( 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 \)
  - Correct formula: \( 4 \times (3 + 3 - 1) = 4 \times 5 = 20 \)
  
- For \( r = 4 \):
  - Provided function: \( 3 * 4 * 4 = 48 \)
  - Correct formula: \( 4 \times (4 + 4 - 1) = 4 \times 7 = 28 \)
  
- For \( r = 5 \):
  - Provided function: \( 3 * 5 * 5 = 75 \)
  - Correct formula: \( 4 \times (5 + 5 - 1) = 4 \times 9 = 36 \)
  
- For \( r = 1984 \):
  - Provided function: \( 3 * 1984 * 1984 = 12504576 \)
  - Correct formula: \( 4 \times (1984 + 1984 - 1) = 4 \times 3967 = 15868 \)

From these calculations, we see that the provided function \( 3 * r * r \) does not match the correct formula for the number of lattice points in the annulus. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the function `func_1` is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
