Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and analyze the given function and its summary to determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that the Euclidean distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, y)\) satisfies \(r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r+1\).
   - The function summary states that `func_1(r)` calculates and returns the value `3 * r * r`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` returns `3 * r * r`.
   - Let's compare this with the example results:
     - For \(r = 1\), the expected number of lattice points is 8.
     - For \(r = 2\), the expected number of lattice points is 16.
     - For \(r = 3\), the expected number of lattice points is 20.
   - The function `func_1(r)` returns:
     - `func_1(1) = 3 * 1 * 1 = 3`
     - `func_1(2) = 3 * 2 * 2 = 12`
     - `func_1(3) = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27`

3. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` does not match the expected counts of lattice points for the given test cases.
   - The function summary claims that the function correctly calculates the number of lattice points, but the calculations show that it does not do so accurately.

Given the discrepancy between the function's output and the expected results, the program is not correct according to the problem statement.

Final: **False**
