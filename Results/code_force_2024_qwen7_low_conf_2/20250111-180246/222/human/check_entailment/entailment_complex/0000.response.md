Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calling a function `func_1(r)` for each test case. However, the function `func_1(r)` simply returns \(3 \times r \times r\), which does not match the required logic to count the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to \(r\) but strictly less than \(r+1\).

To determine the correct number of lattice points, we need to consider the following:
- For a given radius \(r\), the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that \(r \leq \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < r+1\) can be calculated by considering the area of the annulus between two concentric circles of radii \(r\) and \(r+1\).

However, the function `func_1(r)` does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates \(3 \times r \times r\), which is not related to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
