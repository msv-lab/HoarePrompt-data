Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the number of lattice points that have a Euclidean distance from (0, 0) greater than or equal to \( r \) but strictly less than \( r+1 \). The Euclidean distance from (0, 0) to (x, y) is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).

2. **Functionality of `func_1(r)`**:
   - The function `func_1(r)` is supposed to calculate the number of lattice points within the annulus defined by radii \( r \) and \( r+1 \).
   - The current implementation of `func_1(r)` simply returns \( 3 \times r \times r \).

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - Before calling `func_1(r)`, the variable `r` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq r \leq 10^5 \).
   - After calling `func_1(r)`, the function returns \( 3 \times r \times r \).
   - The function documentation states that it correctly performs the calculation and returns the result, which is incorrect as per the problem requirements.

4. **Correct Formula**:
   - To determine the number of lattice points within the annulus, the correct approach involves counting lattice points that lie between the circles of radii \( r \) and \( r+1 \).
   - The formula for the number of lattice points within the annulus is more complex and involves counting lattice points inside a circle of radius \( r+1 \) and subtracting those inside a circle of radius \( r \).
   - However, the provided function `func_1(r)` does not implement this formula.

5. **Verification Using Example**:
   - For \( r = 1 \):
     - Correct number of lattice points = 8 (as shown in the example).
     - Function output = \( 3 \times 1 \times 1 = 3 \).
   - This discrepancy confirms that the function does not meet the requirement.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(r)` does not correctly implement the required logic to count the lattice points in the specified range.

Final: **False**
