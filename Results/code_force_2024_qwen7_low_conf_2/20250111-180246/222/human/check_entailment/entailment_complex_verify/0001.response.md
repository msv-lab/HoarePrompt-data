### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the problem and analyze the provided code step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of lattice points \((x, y)\) such that the Euclidean distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((x, y)\) is within the range \([r, r+1)\).
- The function should return the count of such lattice points for each test case.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the value of \(r\).
   - For each \(r\), it calls the function `func_1(r)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1(r)`**:
   - The function currently returns \(3 \times r \times r\).
   - This formula is not derived from the geometric properties of the problem, as explained in the original assessment.

#### Correctness of the Function `func_1(r)`:
- As mentioned in the original assessment, the function `func_1(r)` returns \(3 \times r \times r\), which is incorrect.
- To understand why, let's consider the geometric interpretation:
  - The area of the annulus between radius \(r\) and \(r+1\) is \(\pi \cdot ((r+1)^2 - r^2) = \pi \cdot (2r + 1)\).
  - However, the number of lattice points in this region is not simply the area but a discrete count, which involves more complex geometric and combinatorial analysis.

- The exact count of lattice points in the annulus is not trivial and requires a detailed analysis. For small values of \(r\), the count can be calculated manually:
  - For \(r = 1\), the points are \((±1, ±1)\), \((±2, 0)\), \((0, ±2)\) -> 8 points.
  - For \(r = 2\), the points include additional combinations like \((±2, ±1)\), \((±1, ±2)\), \((±3, 0)\), \((0, ±3)\) -> 16 points.
  - For \(r = 3\), the points include further combinations -> 20 points.

- The formula \(3 \times r \times r\) is an overestimation and does not accurately reflect the number of lattice points.

#### Re-evaluation Based on Annotations:
- The annotations state that the function `func_1(r)` correctly returns \(3 \times r \times r\), which is incorrect based on the problem requirements.
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the function does not match the expected count of lattice points.

#### Conclusion:
- Given the problem constraints and the incorrect nature of the function `func_1(r)`, the program cannot produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
