Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses the formula `3 * r * r` to calculate the number of lattice points, which is incorrect. The correct approach involves counting lattice points within the annulus defined by the radii `r` and `r+1`. For a given radius `r`, the number of lattice points can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Points} = 4 \times (\lfloor r \rfloor + \lfloor r \rfloor - 1) \]

This accounts for the symmetry of the lattice points around the origin. The given function `3 * r * r` does not accurately reflect this calculation. For example, when `r = 1`, the correct number of lattice points is 8 (as shown in the provided example), but the program outputs 12, which is incorrect.
