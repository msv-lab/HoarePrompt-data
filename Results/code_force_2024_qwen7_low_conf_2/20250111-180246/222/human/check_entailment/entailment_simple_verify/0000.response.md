### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem statement and the given code step-by-step.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
- We need to count the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie within the annulus (ring-shaped region) defined by the radii `r` and `r+1`.
- The formula to count these points involves considering the lattice points within the circle of radius `r+1` and subtracting the points within the circle of radius `r`.

#### Given Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1(r)` returns `3 * r * r`.
- This formula does not account for the lattice points correctly. It simply scales the radius `r` cubically, which is not related to the actual number of lattice points.

#### Correct Approach:
- For a given radius `r`, the number of lattice points can be calculated as follows:
  - Count the number of lattice points inside a circle of radius `r+1`.
  - Subtract the number of lattice points inside a circle of radius `r`.
  - The number of lattice points within a circle of radius `r` can be approximated using the Gauss circle problem, but a simpler and more intuitive approach is to use the formula:
    \[
    \text{Points} = 4 \times (2 \lfloor r \rfloor - 1)
    \]
    This formula counts the lattice points in the four quadrants excluding the boundary points that lie exactly on the circle.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code confirms that `func_1(r)` returns `3 * r * r`, which is indeed incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is correct because the function `func_1(r)` does not implement the correct logic to count the lattice points in the specified annulus. The provided function returns `3 * r * r`, which is not a valid formula for this problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
