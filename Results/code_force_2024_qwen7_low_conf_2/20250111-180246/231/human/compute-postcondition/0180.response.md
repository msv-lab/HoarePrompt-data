The code `curType = 1 - curType` flips the value of `curType` between 0 and 1. Initially, `curType` is 1. Flipping it results in `curType` becoming 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]`, `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `1`, `curType` is `0`, `i` is `n + m`.**
