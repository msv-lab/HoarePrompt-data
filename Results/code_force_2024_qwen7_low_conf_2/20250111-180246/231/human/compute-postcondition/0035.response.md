The code snippet `types[i] = curType` updates the value of `types[i]` to be equal to `curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is 0. Therefore, `types[i]` will be set to 0.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is [n, m], `bad` is 2, `badType` is 1, `curType` is 0, `types[i]` is 0.**
