The code `curType = 1` assigns the value `1` to `curType`. The value of `curType` was initially `0`, and now it is updated to `1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1.**
