Postcondition: ***`res` is `[ans - a[types[2]][2], ans - a[types[2]][2]]`, `i` is 2, and `val` is updated based on the following conditions: if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is `val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`; otherwise, `val` is `val + a[types[i]][n + m]`. Additionally, `n + m` must be greater than 2.***
