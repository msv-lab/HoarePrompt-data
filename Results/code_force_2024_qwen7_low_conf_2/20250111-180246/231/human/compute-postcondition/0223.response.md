`res` is a list of length `n + m` containing the updated values of `val` for each iteration, `i` is `n + m`, `val` is the final computed value. The code appends `ans` to the list `res`. The values of `i` and `val` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m` containing the updated values of `val` for each iteration, and `ans` appended to it; `i` is `n + m`; `val` is the final computed value.**
