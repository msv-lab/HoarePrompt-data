The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state, `types[i]` is equal to `curType_opposite`, and `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1. 

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` remains 1.
- `n + m` remains greater than 0.
- `curType` is the opposite of its original value.
- `types[i]` remains `curType_opposite`.
- `ans` remains incremented by `a[types[i]][i]`.
- `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `types[i]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[i]][i]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1**
