The code `ans += a[types[i]][i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding the value of `a[types[i]][i]` to it. Given that `types[i]` is `1`, this means `ans` is updated by adding `a[1][i]`.

Since `types[i]` is `1`, the value of `ans` is updated to `ans + a[1][i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]`, `ans` is `ans + a[1][i]`, `types[i]` is `1`, `types[j]` (for all j != i) is unchanged.**
