`curType` is assigned the value 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, and the current value of `a[0][i]` is less than the current value of `a[1][i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, and the current value of `a[0][i]` is less than the current value of `a[1][i]`**
