`curType` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `curType` was previously `-1`, but now it is updated to `1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to 0, `curType` is 1.**
