The code snippet `types[i] = curType` assigns the value of `curType` to `types[i]`. Since `curType` is part of the list `cur` and initially was set to either 0 or 1 depending on the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, this assignment updates the value of `types[i]` to be either 0 or 1.

The states of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `bad` is `n + m` or `-1`; `badType` is `1` or `-1`; `cur` is `[1, 0]`; `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`; `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with `types[i]` updated to the value of `curType`; if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is updated to `0`; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.**
