Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1. If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1. Otherwise, these conditions hold.***
