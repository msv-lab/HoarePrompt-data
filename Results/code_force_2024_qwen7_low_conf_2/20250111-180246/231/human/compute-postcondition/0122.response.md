The code snippet assigns the value of `curType` to `types[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `i` is 3
- `n + m` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `types[2]` is 1 (unchanged)
- `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]` (unchanged)
- `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2` (unchanged)
- `bad` is 3 (unchanged)
- `badType` is 1 (unchanged)
- `curType` is 0 (unchanged)

After executing the line `types[i] = curType`, we know:
- `types[3]` is now `curType` (which is 0).

Therefore, the updated variables are:
- `types[3]` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `types[2]` is 1, `types[3]` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3, `badType` is 1, `curType` is 0.
