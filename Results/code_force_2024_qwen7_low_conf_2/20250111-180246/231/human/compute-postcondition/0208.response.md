Postcondition: ***`i` is in the range `[0, n + m - 1]`, `val` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`.
- Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.***
