`curType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Given that `curType` is either 0 or 1, flipping `curType` from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0 will result in the opposite value. The other variables (`i`, `n + m`, `cur[curType]`, `bounds[curType]`, and the comparison between `a[0][i]` and `a[1][i]`) remain unaffected.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value (either 0 or 1), and the current value of `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`**
