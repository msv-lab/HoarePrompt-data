`val` is assigned the value `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. The value of `ans` and `a[types[i]][i]` is not specified, so `val` will be the difference between `ans` and `a[types[i]][i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `- `i` is in the range `[1, n + m - 1]`; - `val` is updated based on the given conditions; - `res` is a list containing the updated `val`.

Output State: **`i` is in the range `[1, n + m - 1]`; `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`; `res` is a list containing the updated `val`.**
