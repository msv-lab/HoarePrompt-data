In the initial state, the variables are:
- `cur` is `[1, 0]`
- `i` is `2`
- `types[i]` is `0`

The code snippet is: `cur[types[i]] += 1`.

Let's analyze the impact of this code:
- `types[i]` is `0`, so the code becomes `cur[0] += 1`.
- The value of `cur[0]` is currently `1`, so after incrementing by `1`, `cur[0]` becomes `2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cur` is [2, 0], `i` is 2, `types[i]` is 0.**
