The code snippet `print(*res)` prints the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. However, the values of the elements in `res` themselves are not changed by this operation. The other variables remain in their previous states since they are not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`res` is a list of `n + m` elements with `ans` appended to it, `t` is greater than 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + m`, `a` is a list of lists with some structure, `b` is a list of `n + m + 1` integers, `n` and `m` are the final values after the loop, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` and `badType` are the final values after the loop, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `ans` is the final value after the loop, `types` is the final list after the loop, and `curType` is the final value after the loop; `res` elements are printed.**
