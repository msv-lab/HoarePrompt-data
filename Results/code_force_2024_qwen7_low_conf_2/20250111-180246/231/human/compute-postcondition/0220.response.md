Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + m`, `val` is updated based on the conditions: if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is `val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`. Otherwise, `val` is `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`. `res` is a list containing the previous values of `val` and the new value of `val` appended to it.***
