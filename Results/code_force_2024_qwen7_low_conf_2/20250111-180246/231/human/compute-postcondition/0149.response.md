The `print(*res)` statement prints the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces, but it does not change the elements of `res` itself. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, where each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions; the last element of `res` is `ans`.**
