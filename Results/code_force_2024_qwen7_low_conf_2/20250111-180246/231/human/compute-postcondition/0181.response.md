The code `bad = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bad`. From the initial state, `i` is equal to `n + m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `bad` being assigned the value of `i`.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `bad` is `n + m`; `badType` is `-1`; `cur` is `[1, 0]`; `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`; `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `1`; `curType` is `0`; `i` is `n + m`.**
