Postcondition: **`total` must be greater than 0, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `i` must be within the range [0, n + m - 1], `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `badType` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `ans` is the sum of `a[types[i]][i]` for all `i` in range `n + m`, `types` is a list of length \(n + m + 1\) with each element being either 0 or 1 based on the comparison inside the loop, `curType` is determined based on the conditions inside the loop, and `res` is an empty list, `val` is not `ans - a[types[i]][i]` (since `i` is not within the specified range or `bad == -1` or `types[i] != badType`).**
