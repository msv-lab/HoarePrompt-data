The code snippet sets `types[i]` to `curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is `0`. So, `types[i]` will be set to `0`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

- `types[i]` is now `0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is `0`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `0`, `curType` is `0`.**
