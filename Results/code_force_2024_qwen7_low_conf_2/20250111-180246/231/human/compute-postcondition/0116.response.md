Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1. If `a[0][3] < a[1][3]`, `curType` is updated to 1. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
