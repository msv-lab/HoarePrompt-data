The code initializes the `bounds` list with the values of `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`.**
