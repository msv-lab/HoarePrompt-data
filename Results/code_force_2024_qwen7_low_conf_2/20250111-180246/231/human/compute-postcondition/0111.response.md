Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is incremented by `a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is incremented by 1, if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise these conditions hold; `ans` is further incremented by `a[types[i]][i]` which translates to `a[1][2]`.**
