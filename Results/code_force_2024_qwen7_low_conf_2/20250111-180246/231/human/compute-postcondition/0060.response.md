Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is now `[val]`, where `val` is defined based on the conditions provided but its specific value is unknown.
   - The other variables maintain their initial states.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n + m):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than the current limit because Python loops run until `i < n + m`.

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since the loop is about to enter its next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n + m`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `res` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The other variables maintain their initial states.
   - `i` will be `previous_i + 1`, and this new value of `i` must still be less than `n + m`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`res` is now `[val]`, where `val` is defined based on the conditions provided but its specific value is unknown, `i` is `previous_i + 1`, and `i` must be less than `n + m`**.
