The code `badType = 1 - curType` assigns the value of `1 - curType` to `badType`. Given that `curType` is initially 0, `badType` will be `1 - 0`, which is 1. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3, `badType` is 1**
