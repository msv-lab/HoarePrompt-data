Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n + m` is greater than 0
   - `curType` is 1
   - `types[2]` is 1
   - `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`
   - `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`
   - If `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise these conditions hold.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n + m):
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is based on the variable `i`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + m`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes Again:**
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it needs to be incremented to 3 for the loop to continue.
   - The condition `n + m > 0` must still hold true.
   - `curType` remains unchanged.
   - `types[2]` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged.
   - `cur[1]` remains unchanged.
   - `bad` and `badType` remain unchanged unless `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, but since we are only concerned with the start of the next iteration, we don't need to consider this condition explicitly here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` should be 3.
- `n + m` must still be greater than 0.
- All other states (`curType`, `types[2]`, `ans`, `cur[1]`, `bad`, `badType`) remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1, otherwise these conditions hold.**
