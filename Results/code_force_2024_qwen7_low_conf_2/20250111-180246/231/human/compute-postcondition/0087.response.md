The variable `curType` is assigned the value `0`. The values of `i` and `n + m` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0; `curType` is 0.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0; `curType` is 0**
