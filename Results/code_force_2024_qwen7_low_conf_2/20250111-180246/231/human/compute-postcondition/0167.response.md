`curType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is initially equal to `1`. Therefore, `curType` will be updated to `0` (since `1 - 1` equals `0`). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to 0, `curType` is 0**
