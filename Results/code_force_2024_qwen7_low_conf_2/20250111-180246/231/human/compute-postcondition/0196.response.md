Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `n + m` or `-1`, `badType` is `1` or `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]`, `ans` is `ans + delta`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with `types[i]` updated to `1` if `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`; otherwise, `types[i]` remains unchanged as `0`. If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `bad` is `-1`, the function continues with the given state; otherwise, `bad` is updated to `n + m` or `-1` and `badType` is updated to `1` or `-1`.***
