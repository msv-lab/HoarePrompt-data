Let's analyze the given loop step-by-step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations.

### Initial State
- `res` is an empty list.
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`.
- `bad` is either `-1` or `n + m`.
- `badType` is either `-1` or `1`.
- `cur` is `[n, m]` (if `n` and `m` are the maximum possible values).
- `ans` is the sum of the selected elements from `a` based on the conditions.
- `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` where each element `types[i]` is either `0` or `1` depending on which list (`a[0]` or `a[1]`) was chosen more frequently.
- `curType` is determined based on the conditions inside the loop.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(n + m):
    val = ans - a[types[i]][i]
    if bad != -1 and i < bad and types[i] == badType:
        val = val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]
    else:
        val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]
    res.append(val)
```

### Analysis
1. **Initialization**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n + m - 1`.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `val`: Initially set to `ans - a[types[i]][i]`.
   - `res`: A list that accumulates the updated values of `val` for each iteration.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, an additional adjustment is made to `val`.
   - Otherwise, `val` is adjusted by adding `a[types[i]][n + m]`.

4. **Appending to `res`**:
   - Each updated `val` is appended to `res`.

### Final State After All Iterations
After the loop has executed for all `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`, the following will be true:
- `res` will contain `n + m` values, each representing the updated `val` for each iteration of the loop.
- `i` will be in the range `[n + m]` since the loop iterates `n + m` times.
- `val` will be the last computed value in the loop.

### Conclusion
Given that the loop runs exactly `n + m` times and updates `val` based on the conditions specified, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all iterations is:

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m` containing the updated values of `val` for each iteration, `i` is `n + m`, `val` is the final computed value, and all other variables retain their initial or final values determined by the loop conditions.**
