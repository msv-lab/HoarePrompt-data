The line `curType = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `curType`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]`, `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `0`, `curType` is `0`, `i` is `n + m`**
