`cur` is assigned the value `[0, 0]`. This initializes a new list `cur` with two elements both set to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`**
