The code updates the `cur` list by incrementing the element at the index `types[i]` by 1. Since `i` is 3, `types[i]` is the fourth element in the `types` list (which is indexed from 0), and its value is 0. Therefore, `cur[0]` will be incremented by 1.

- Initial State: `cur` is [2, 0], `i` is 3, `types` is [_, _, _, 0], `ans` is `a[types[i]][i]`

- After the code runs, `cur[0]` will be updated to `cur[0] + 1`, which means `cur[0]` will become `0 + 1` or `1`.

Output State: **`cur` is [2, 1], `i` is 3, `types` is [_, _, _, 0], `ans` is `a[types[i]][i]`**
