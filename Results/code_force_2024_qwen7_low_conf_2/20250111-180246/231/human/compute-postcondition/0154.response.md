`a` is appended with a list obtained from converting the input split into integers. The `input()` function reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, and `map(int, ...)` converts each element in the input to an integer. The resulting list is then appended to `a`. The states of `res`, `bounds`, and `n`, `m` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is a list containing one list of integers (the result of converting the input split by spaces to integers), `res` is a list of length `n + m`, each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions, the last element of `res` is `ans`; `bounds` is `[n, m]`;**
