The code `cur[types[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cur[types[i]]` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, and `types[3]` is 0. Therefore, the code updates `cur[0]` by 1.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Initial values:
   - `i` is 3
   - `types[2]` is 1
   - `types[3]` is 0
   - `ans` is equal to `ans + a[0][3]` (this part does not affect `cur`)
   - `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2` (this part does not affect `cur[0]`)
   - `bad` is 3
   - `badType` is 1
   - `curType` is 0

2. After executing `cur[types[i]] += 1`:
   - `i` remains 3
   - `types[2]` remains 1
   - `types[3]` remains 0
   - `ans` remains as it was initially (since no specific value for `ans` was given, we keep it as is)
   - `cur[1]` remains as it was initially (since no specific value for `cur[1]` was given, we keep it as is)
   - `bad` remains 3
   - `badType` remains 1
   - `curType` remains 0
   - `cur[0]` is incremented by 1

Therefore, the updated value for `cur[0]` is 1 (assuming it was 0 before the increment).

Output State: **`i` is 3, `types[2]` is 1, `types[3]` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[0][3]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3, `badType` is 1, `curType` is 0, `cur[0]` is 1**
