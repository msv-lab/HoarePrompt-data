The code sets `badType` to `1 - curType`. Given that `curType` is initially 0, `badType` will be `1 - 0`, which is 1. The other variables (`i`, `n + m`, `types[2]`, `ans`, `cur[curType_opposite]`, and `bad`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1, `bad` is 2, `badType` is 1**
