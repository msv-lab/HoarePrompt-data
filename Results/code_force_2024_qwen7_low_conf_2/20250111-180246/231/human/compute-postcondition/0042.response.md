The code `curType = 1 - curType` changes the value of `curType`. Initially, `curType` is 1 if `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`. Since the condition for `curType` is not specified in the initial state and we are only updating `curType`, we will assume the initial value of `curType` based on the given condition. If `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`, then `curType` is 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `cur` is `[2, 0]`
- `i` is 3
- `curType` is 1 (since `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`)

After executing the line `curType = 1 - curType`, `curType` will become `1 - 1`, which is `0`.

Output State: **`cur` is [2, 0], `i` is 3, `curType` is 0**
