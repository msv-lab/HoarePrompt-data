`cur[types[i]]` is incremented by 1. Since `types[i]` is `1`, the first element of `cur` (which is `cur[0]`) is increased by 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[cur[0] + 1, 0]`, `ans` is `ans + a[1][i]`, `types[i]` is `1`, `types[j]` (for all j != i) is unchanged.**
