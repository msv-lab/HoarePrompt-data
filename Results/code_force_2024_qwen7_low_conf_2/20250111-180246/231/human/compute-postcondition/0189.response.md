The code `curType = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `curType`. This affects the variable `curType` directly, setting it to `0`. All other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `n + m` or `-1`, `badType` is `1` or `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]` with one of its elements updated by `+1`, `ans` is `ans + delta`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with `types[i]` updated to the value of `curType`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is updated to `0`; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `curType` is `0`**
