First, let's understand the initial state and the code snippet:
- Initial State: 
  - `i` is 3
  - `n + m` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
  - `types[2]` is 1 (unchanged)
  - `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]` (unchanged)
  - `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2` (unchanged)
  - `bad` is 3 (unchanged)
  - `badType` is 1 (unchanged)
  - `curType` is 0 (unchanged)
- Code Snippet: `types[i] = curType`

After executing `types[i] = curType`:
- `types[3]` is now `curType` which is 0.

Next, let's consider the code snippet `ans += a[types[i]][i]`:
- `i` is 3
- `types[i]` is now `types[3]` which is 0
- So, `a[types[i]][i]` is `a[0][3]`

Since `ans` was initially equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, the new value of `ans` will be `ans + a[0][3]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `types[2]` is 1, `types[3]` is 0, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[0][3]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3, `badType` is 1, `curType` is 0**
