Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1` (set to `i` if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is `0`), `badType` is `-1` (set to `1` if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` and `curType` is `0`), `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is `0`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0`, `curType` is `0`. If `bad` is not `-1` after the condition, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is set to `i`. Similarly, if `badType` is not `-1` after the condition, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is set to `1`.***
