Postcondition: ***`cur` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is [n, m], `bad` is 2, `badType` is 1, `curType` is 0. If the condition `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]` is true, `bad` is set to -1 and `badType` is set to -1. Otherwise, `bad` and `badType` remain unchanged.***
