`a` is appended with the list of integers inputted by the user, converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial value of `a` is an empty list, and the input is split into multiple integers. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing the integers inputted by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`.**
