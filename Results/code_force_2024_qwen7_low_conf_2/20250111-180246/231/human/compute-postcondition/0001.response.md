`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which converts the input into two integers. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged according to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\); `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\); `n` is the first integer input; `m` is the second integer input.
