The code `badType = 1 - curType` assigns the value of `1 - curType` to the variable `badType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, meaning if `curType` was originally 0, it is now 1, and vice versa. The value of `badType` is therefore the opposite of `curType`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, `bad` is 0, `badType` is 1 - `curType`**
