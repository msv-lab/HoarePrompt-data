Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of length `n + m`; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `bad` is `n + m` or `-1`; `badType` is `1` or `-1`; `cur` is `[1, 0]`; `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`; `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `1`; if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is updated to `0`; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
