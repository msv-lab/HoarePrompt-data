`ans` is incremented by the value of `a[types[i]][i]`. Given that `types[i]` is `curType_opposite` and `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `types[i]` remains `curType_opposite`. However, since `curType` and `curType_opposite` are just different representations of each other, the value of `types[i]` does not provide new information about the actual value used in the calculation. The exact value of `ans` depends on the values stored in `a[types[i]][i]`, but without knowing these values, we cannot specify a concrete value for `ans`. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `types[i]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[i]][i]`**
