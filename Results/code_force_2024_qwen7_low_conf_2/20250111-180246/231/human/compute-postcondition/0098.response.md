`types[i]` is assigned the value of `curType`. The value of `i` remains 0 because no operation changes it. The condition `n + m > 0` is still valid. The value of `curType` is updated to the opposite of its original value, but its specific value is not given, so we will denote it as `curType_opposite`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value, `types[i]` is `curType_opposite`**
