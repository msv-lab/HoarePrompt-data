The code updates the value of `val` by adding `a[types[i]][n + m]` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `res` is `[ans - a[types[i]][i], ans - a[types[i]][i]]`
- `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`

After executing the code, `val` becomes `val + a[types[i]][n + m]`. Since `val` was initially `ans - a[types[i]][i]`, the new value of `val` will be:

\[ \text{new\_val} = (ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m] \]

The variable `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`res` is `[ans - a[types[i]][i], ans - a[types[i]][i]]`, `val` is `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`**
