To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Current Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n + m - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

2. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is defined as follows:
   - `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 2]][previous_i + 2] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`. Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

Given these points, let's break it down step by step:

- **Incrementing `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over `i` in the range `0` to `n + m - 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- **Updating `res`**: The value of `res` at the start of the next iteration will depend on the new value of `i` (which is `previous_i + 1`). We need to check the condition to see if the new value of `i` fits the criteria to update `val` accordingly.

Let's denote `previous_i` as the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. Then, at the start of the next iteration, `i` becomes `previous_i + 1`.

The updated value of `res` at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 3]][previous_i + 3] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `bad != -1` and `previous_i + 1 < bad` and `types[previous_i + 1] == badType`. Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 1]][previous_i + 1] + a[types[previous_i + 1]][n + m]`.

Since the initial values of `res` are given as `[val, val]` where `val` is based on the conditions mentioned above, the state at the start of the next iteration will remain similar but with the updated `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`res` is now `[val, val]`, where `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 3]][previous_i + 3] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `bad != -1` and `previous_i + 1 < bad` and `types[previous_i + 1] == badType`. Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 1]][previous_i + 1] + a[types[previous_i + 1]][n + m]`.**
