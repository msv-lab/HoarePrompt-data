The code assigns the value of `i` to `bad`. Since `i` is initially 2, `bad` will be 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1, `bad` is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1, `bad` is 2**
