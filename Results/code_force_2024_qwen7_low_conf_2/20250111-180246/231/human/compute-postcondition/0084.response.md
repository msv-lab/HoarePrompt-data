The line `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + m`, `a` is a list containing an additional list of integers (based on the input), `b` is a list of `n + m + 1` integers, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is `0`, `types` is the final list after the loop, `curType` is the final value after the loop, `res` is elements printed, `badType` is `-1`**
