The variable `bad` is assigned the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `bad` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cur` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is [n, m], `bad` is 2, `badType` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `curType` is 0.**
