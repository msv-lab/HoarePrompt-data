The line of code `curType = 1` changes the value of `curType` from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`cur` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is [n, m], `bad` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `badType` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `curType` is 1**
