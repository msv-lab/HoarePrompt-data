Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(0 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(2 \leq n + m + 1 \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\).

2. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each test case, meaning it will run exactly `t` times.
   - For each test case, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are provided.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - Since the loop runs for each test case, the loop will execute as long as there are test cases (`t > 0`).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - The lists `a` and `b` should have the correct lengths and constraints as defined (each list has \(n + m + 1\) elements, and each element is within the specified range).

Given these points, we can conclude the necessary states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- The lists `a` and `b` must have the correct length \(n + m + 1\) and their elements must satisfy the given constraints.

Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\)**
