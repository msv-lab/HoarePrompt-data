The line `badType = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `badType`. The initial state values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, `bounds`, and `bad` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the additional information that `badType` is now `-1`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1**.
