Output State: **`res` is a list of `n + m` elements where each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions, `t` is the final value after all iterations, `n` and `m` are the final values after all iterations, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` and `badType` are the final values after all iterations, `cur` is `[n, m]`, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, `types` is the final list after all iterations, and `curType` is the final value after all iterations.**
