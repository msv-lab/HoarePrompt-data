Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3, `badType` is 1.***

Explanation: Since the if condition `bad == -1` is not satisfied (as `bad` is initially set to 3 in the if part), the else part does not apply. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the postcondition of the if part.
