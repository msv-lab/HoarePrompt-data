Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value. If `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, then `curType` becomes the opposite of its original value and `bad` is -1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n + m`, and `curType` remain as described in the precondition.**
