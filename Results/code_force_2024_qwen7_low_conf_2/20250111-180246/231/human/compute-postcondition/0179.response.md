Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `-1`, `badType` is `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]`, `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `1`, `curType` is `1`, `i` is `n + m`. If `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`, then `curType` is updated to `1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
