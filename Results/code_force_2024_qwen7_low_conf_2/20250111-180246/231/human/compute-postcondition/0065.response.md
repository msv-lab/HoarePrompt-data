The code snippet `res.append(val)` appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. The value of `val` is defined based on certain conditions. Since the value of `val` is not specified in the initial state, we will assume that `val` is calculated according to the given formula.

The impact of this code on the program is that it adds the current value of `val` to the list `res`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:

- `res` is now `[val]`, where `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 2]][previous_i + 2] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`. Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

After executing the code `res.append(val)`, the list `res` will have one more element, which is the value of `val` appended to the existing list.

Output State: **`res` is now `[val, val]`, where `val` is `ans - a[types[previous_i + 2]][previous_i + 2] + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]` if `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`. Otherwise, `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i] + a[types[i]][n + m]`.**
