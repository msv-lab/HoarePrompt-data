The code changes the value of `curType` to 1. The initial state of `curType` being 0 is replaced with the new value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 1, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1**
