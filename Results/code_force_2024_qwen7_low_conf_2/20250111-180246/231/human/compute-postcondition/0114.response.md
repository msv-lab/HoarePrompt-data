`curType` is assigned the value 0. The value of `i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` was initially 1, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` was equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` was `cur[1] + 2`, and if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1. After assigning `curType` to 0, the other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1.**
