The given code snippet attempts to assign a value to `val`, but there are several issues:
1. `ans` is not defined in the provided code.
2. `a` is not defined in the provided code.
3. `types` is not defined in the provided code.

Since the variables `ans`, `a`, and `types` are not defined, the code cannot be executed, and no value can be assigned to `val`. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
