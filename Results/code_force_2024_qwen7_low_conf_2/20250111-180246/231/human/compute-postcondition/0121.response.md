Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3, `badType` is 1, `curType` is 0. If `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, the conditions update `curType` to 0. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.***
