`curType` is assigned the value `0`. This changes the value of `curType` from its original value (which was the opposite of its original value) to `0`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1**
