The code sets `curType` to `1`. This directly updates the value of `curType`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

- `res` is a list of length `n + m`.
- `bounds` is `[n, m]`.
- `bad` is `n + m` or `-1`.
- `badType` is `1` or `-1`.
- `cur` is `[1, 0]` with one of its elements updated by `+1`.
- `ans` is `ans + delta`.
- `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with `types[i]` updated to the value of `curType`, if `cur[curType] == bounds[curType]`, then `curType` is updated to `0`; otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`, `curType` is `0`.
- `curType` is now `1`.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `n + m` or `-1`, `badType` is `1` or `-1`, `cur` is `[1, 0]` with one of its elements updated by `+1`, `ans` is `ans + delta`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with `types[i]` updated to `1`, if `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `curType` is `0`; otherwise, `curType` is `1`, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`. `curType` is `1`.**
