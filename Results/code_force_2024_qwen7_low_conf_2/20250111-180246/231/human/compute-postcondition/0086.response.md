To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will run. The loop runs for each value of `i` from `0` to `n + m - 1`. Here are the key points to verify:

1. **Variable `i`:** The variable `i` should start from `0` and go up to `n + m - 1`. Given that `i` is initially set to `n + m`, it needs to be adjusted to `0`.

2. **Variable `n + m`:** Since the loop iterates based on `n + m`, we need to confirm that `n + m` is indeed greater than `0`, which is already given as part of the initial state.

3. **Initial Value of `i`:** We need to adjust `i` to `0` to begin the loop.

Based on these considerations, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `n + m` should remain as it is since it is already stated as greater than `0`.

The state after adjustment should include:
- `i` is `0`.
- `n + m` is greater than `0`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0**
