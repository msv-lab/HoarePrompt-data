According to the given code snippet and the current state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `cur` is `[2, 0]`
- `i` is `2`
- `types[i]` is `0`

The for loop statement is:
```
for i in range(n + m):
```

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to check the condition for the loop to continue executing:
- The loop continues as long as `i < n + m`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `2`
- Therefore, for the loop to continue, `2` must be less than `n + m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1` (since it starts from `2` and increments by `1` each iteration), making `i` equal to `3`.

Thus, the updated condition for the next iteration is:
- `i` must be `3`
- Since `i` is now `3`, `n + m` must still allow the loop to continue, meaning `3 <= n + m`.

However, since we are only focusing on the state modification due to the loop increment, we can conclude that `i` will be `3` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that the values of `cur` and `types[i]` do not change inside the loop (they only change during the loop execution based on the loop index `i`), we do not need to modify those values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`cur` is [2, 0], `i` is 3, `types[i]` is 0.**
