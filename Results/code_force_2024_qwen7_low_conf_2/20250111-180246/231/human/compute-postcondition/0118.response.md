The code `bad = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the variable `bad`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` remains 3
- `n + m` is still greater than 0
- `curType` is still 0
- `types[2]` is still 1
- `ans` is still equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`
- `cur[1]` is still `cur[1] + 2`
- If `cur[1] == bounds[1]`, then `bad` is set to 2 and `badType` is set to 1. This condition is not evaluated in this step.
- If `a[0][3] < a[1][3]`, `curType` is updated to 1. This condition is not evaluated in this step.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `ans + a[1][2] + a[1][2]`, `cur[1]` is `cur[1] + 2`, `bad` is 3**
