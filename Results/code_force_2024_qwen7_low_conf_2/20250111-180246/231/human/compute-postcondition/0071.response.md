The code snippet `res.append(val)` appends the current value of `val` to the list `res`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the variables and list.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` is a list containing two elements, both equal to `ans - a[types[i]][i]`.
   - If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val` is updated to `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]`.
   - Otherwise, `val` is updated to `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

2. **Impact of Code**:
   - The value of `val` is appended to the list `res`.
   - The list `res` will now contain three elements instead of two.
   - The first two elements of `res` remain unchanged from the initial state.
   - The third element of `res` is the current value of `val`.

3. **Updated Values**:
   - The first two elements of `res` remain `ans - a[types[i]][i]`.
   - The third element of `res` is `val`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`res` is a list containing three elements, the first two are `ans - a[types[i]][i]` and the third one is `val`**.
