The code snippet appends the value of `ans` to the list `res`. This means that the last element of `res` is now `ans`, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged based on the given conditions.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. The list `res` is initially defined with elements based on the conditions provided.
2. The line `res.append(ans)` appends the value of `ans` to the end of `res`.

Since the exact values of `ans` and the elements of `res` before appending `ans` are not specified, we can only say that the last element of `res` is now `ans`. The rest of the elements remain as they were initially defined based on the conditions.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, where each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions; the last element of `res` is `ans`.**
