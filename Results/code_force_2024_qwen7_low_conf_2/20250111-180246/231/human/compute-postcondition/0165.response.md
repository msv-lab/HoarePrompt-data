Postcondition: ***`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to 0, `curType` is 1. If `a[0][i] < a[1][i]`, then `curType` is updated to 1. There is no change in the other variables since there is no else part provided in the code.***
