The code `print(*res)` prints the elements of the list `res` using the unpacking operator. However, this operation does not change the state of the variables `res`, `i`, or `val`. The list `res` is printed but not modified in place.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m` containing the updated values of `val` for each iteration, and `ans` appended to it; `i` is `n + m`; `val` is the final computed value**
