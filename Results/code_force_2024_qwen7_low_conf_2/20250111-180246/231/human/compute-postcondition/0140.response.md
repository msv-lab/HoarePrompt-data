The code `res.append(val)` appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. The value of `val` depends on the conditions given. Since the conditions involve variables like `bad`, `i`, `types`, `ans`, `a`, and `n`, `m`, we need to consider those to determine the value of `val`.

Given the initial state:
- `res` is `[val]`
- `i` is either 1 or 2

Let's analyze the two possible cases for `i`:

1. **Case 1: `i` is 1**
   - We need to check the condition: `if bad != -1 and i < bad and types[i] == badType`
     - For `i = 1`, the condition simplifies to: `if bad != -1 and 1 < bad and types[1] == badType`
     - This condition can only be true if `bad > 1` and `types[1] == badType`.
     - If the condition is true, then `val` is `(ans - a[2][1]) + a[0][1] - a[1][1] + a[1][5]`.
     - If the condition is false, then `val` is `ans - a[types[1]][1] + a[types[2]][n + m]`.

2. **Case 2: `i` is 2**
   - Similarly, we need to check the condition: `if bad != -1 and i < bad and types[i] == badType`
     - For `i = 2`, the condition simplifies to: `if bad != -1 and 2 < bad and types[2] == badType`
     - This condition can only be true if `bad > 2` and `types[2] == badType`.
     - If the condition is true, then `val` is `(ans - a[2][1]) + a[0][1] - a[1][1] + a[1][5]`.
     - If the condition is false, then `val` is `ans - a[types[1]][1] + a[types[2]][n + m]`.

Since the exact values of `bad`, `types`, `ans`, `a`, and `n`, `m` are not specified, we can only express `val` in terms of these variables. However, `res` will contain `val` after the append operation.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `res` becomes `[val, val]` (where `val` is one of the expressions depending on the conditions)
- `i` remains either 1 or 2

Output State: **`res` is `[val, val]`, `i` is either 1 or 2**
