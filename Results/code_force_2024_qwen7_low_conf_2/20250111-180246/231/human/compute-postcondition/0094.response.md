The code `bad = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bad`. Given that the initial state is `i` is 0, the value of `bad` is updated to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is the opposite of its original value (either 0 or 1), the current value of `cur[curType]` equals `bounds[curType]`, and `bad` is 0.**
