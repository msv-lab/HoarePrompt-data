The code changes the value of `badType` to `1 - curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is 0. Therefore, `badType` will be updated to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is `i`, `badType` is 1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to 0, `curType` is 0**
