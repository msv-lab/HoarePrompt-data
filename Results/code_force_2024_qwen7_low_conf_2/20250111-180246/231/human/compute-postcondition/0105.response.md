`curType` is assigned the value `1 - curType`. Given that the initial value of `curType` is 1, `1 - curType` will be `1 - 1`, which equals 0. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n + m` is greater than 0, `curType` is 0, `types[2]` is `curType_opposite`, `ans` is incremented by `a[types[2]][2]`, `cur[curType_opposite]` is incremented by 1.**
