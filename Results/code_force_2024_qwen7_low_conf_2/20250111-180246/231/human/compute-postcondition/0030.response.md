`curType` is updated to `1 - curType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is 1 if `a[0][i] < a[1][i]` is true, otherwise `curType` is 0. Since `curType` starts as 1 (because `a[0][i] < a[1][i]` is true initially), updating it to `1 - curType` will make it 0. 

Output State: **`cur` is [1, 0], `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is [n, m], `bad` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `badType` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `curType` is 0.**
