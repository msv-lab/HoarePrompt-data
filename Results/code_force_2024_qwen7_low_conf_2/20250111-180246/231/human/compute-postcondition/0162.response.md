`curType` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `curType` was previously undefined, but now it is explicitly set to `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is -1, `badType` is -1, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is 0, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to 0, and `curType` is 0.**
