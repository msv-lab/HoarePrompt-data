Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `n + m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing its original elements plus one more list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`, `bad` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `badType` is either 1 or -1 depending on the condition `bad == -1` in the if statement, `cur` is `[0, 0]`, `ans` is `0`, `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0`, `curType` is `0`, and `a[0][i]` is less than `a[1][i]`.***
