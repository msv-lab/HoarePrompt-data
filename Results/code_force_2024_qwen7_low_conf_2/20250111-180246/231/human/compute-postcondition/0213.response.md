`val` is updated by adding `a[types[i]][n + m]` to its current value. Since the initial state of `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`, the new value of `val` becomes `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `a`, `types`, `n`, `m`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is in the range `[1, n + m - 1]`; `val` is `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`; `res` is a list containing the updated `val`.**
