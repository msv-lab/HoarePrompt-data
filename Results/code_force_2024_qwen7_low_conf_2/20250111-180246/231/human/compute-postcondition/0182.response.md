The line of code `badType = 1 - curType` changes the value of `badType`. Given the initial state, `curType` is `0`, so `badType` will be `1 - 0`, which is `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`; `bounds` is `[n, m]`; `bad` is `n + m`; `badType` is `1`; `cur` is `[1, 0]`; `ans` is `ans + a[types[i]][i]`; `types` is a list of length `n + m + 1` with all elements set to `0` except `types[i]` which is `1`; `curType` is `0`; `i` is `n + m`.**
