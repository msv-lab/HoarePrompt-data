`val` is updated by adding `a[types[i]][n + m]` to its current value. The initial state of `val` is `ans - a[types[i]][i]`. Therefore, the new value of `val` becomes `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + m`, `val` is `(ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`, `res` is a list containing the previous values of `val` and the new value `ans - a[types[i]][i]` appended to it.**
