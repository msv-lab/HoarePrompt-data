The code appends the value of `val` to the list `res`. Based on the given conditions, `val` is defined as follows:
- If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `val = ans - a[types[i]][i]`.
- Otherwise, `val = sum(a[types[i]][n + m] for i in range(n + m))`.

However, since the code snippet does not include the actual values of `val` based on these conditions, and we don't have the specific values of `ans`, `a`, `types`, `bad`, `badType`, and `n + m`, we cannot determine the exact value of `val` without these details.

Therefore, the only change in the state is the addition of `val` to the list `res`. Since we do not know the specific value of `val`, we can only say that `res` now contains `val`.

Output State: **`res` is now `[val]`, where `val` is defined based on the conditions provided but its specific value is unknown. The other variables maintain their initial states.**
