Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n + m`, where each element `res[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions. Specifically, for each `i` in the range `0` to `n + m - 1`, `res[i]` is computed as follows:
- If `bad != -1` and `i < bad` and `types[i] == badType`, then `res[i] = (ans - a[types[i]][i]) + (a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad]) + a[1 - badType][n + m]`.
- Otherwise, `res[i] = (ans - a[types[i]][i]) + a[types[i]][n + m]`.**

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n + m` is 0), then:
- `res` remains an empty list.
- `i` remains 0, though `i` will not change since the loop does not execute.
