The line `a = []` initializes an empty list for `a`. This operation changes the value of `a` from a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers to an empty list. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `bounds`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a list of \(n + m + 1\) integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\) and \(b_i \neq a_i\), `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `bounds` is `[n, m]`.**
