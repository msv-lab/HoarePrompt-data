You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Program:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
Example Answer 1:
Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Program:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Example Answer 2:
Correctness: **False**.

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a function to perform binary search of a number in an list
Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    if arr[left] == target:
        return left
    return -1
```
Example answer 3:
Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Monocarp is opening his own IT company. He wants to hire n programmers and m
testers.

There are n+m+1 candidates, numbered from 1 to n+m+1 in chronological order of
their arriving time. The i -th candidate has programming skill a_i and testing
skill b_i (a person's programming skill is different from their testing
skill). The skill of the team is the sum of the programming skills of all
candidates hired as programmers, and the sum of the testing skills of all
candidates hired as testers.

When a candidate arrives to interview, Monocarp tries to assign them to the
most suitable position for them (if their programming skill is higher, then he
hires them as a programmer, otherwise as a tester). If all slots for that
position are filled, Monocarp assigns them to the other position.

Your task is, for each candidate, calculate the skill of the team if everyone
except them comes to interview. Note that it means that exactly n+m candidates
will arrive, so all n+m positions in the company will be filled.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and m (0 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; 2 \le n + m + 1 \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of programmers and the number of testers Monocarp wants to hire, respectively; 
  * the second line contains n + m + 1 integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n+m+1} (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the programming skill of the i -th candidate; 
  * the third line contains n + m + 1 integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{n+m+1} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ; b_i \ne a_i ), where b_i is the testing skill of the i -th candidate. 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of (n + m + 1) over all test cases
doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n + m + 1 integers, where the i -th integer should
be equal to the skill of the team if everyone except the i -th candidate comes
to interview.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    0 2
    
    4 5 5
    
    5 4 1
    
    1 2
    
    2 1 5 4
    
    5 2 3 1
    
    3 1
    
    4 3 3 4 1
    
    5 5 4 5 2

Output

    1 2 
    5 6 9 
    8 11 11 12 
    13 13 13 12 15 
    
Note

Let's consider the third test case of the example:

  * if the 1 -st candidate does not arrive, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 ; 
  * if the 2 -nd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 ; 
  * if the 3 -rd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 ; 
  * if the 4 -th candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 .
Program:
```
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        bounds = [n, m]
        a = []
        a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        a.append(list(map(int, input().split())))
        bad = -1
        badType = -1
        cur = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        types = [0 for i in range(n + m + 1)]
        for i in range(n + m):
            curType = 0
            if a[0][i] < a[1][i]:
                curType = 1
            if cur[curType] == bounds[curType]:
                curType = 1 - curType
                if bad == -1:
                    bad = i
                    badType = 1 - curType
            types[i] = curType
            ans += a[types[i]][i]
            cur[types[i]] += 1
        res = []
        for i in range(n + m):
            val = ans - a[types[i]][i]
            if bad != -1 and i < bad and (types[i] == badType):
                val = val + a[badType][bad] - a[1 - badType][bad] + a[1 - badType][n + m]
            else:
                val = val + a[types[i]][n + m]
            res.append(val)
        res.append(ans)
        print(*res)


```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
