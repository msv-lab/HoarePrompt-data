You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is opening his own IT company. He wants to hire n programmers and m
testers.

There are n+m+1 candidates, numbered from 1 to n+m+1 in chronological order of
their arriving time. The i -th candidate has programming skill a_i and testing
skill b_i (a person's programming skill is different from their testing
skill). The skill of the team is the sum of the programming skills of all
candidates hired as programmers, and the sum of the testing skills of all
candidates hired as testers.

When a candidate arrives to interview, Monocarp tries to assign them to the
most suitable position for them (if their programming skill is higher, then he
hires them as a programmer, otherwise as a tester). If all slots for that
position are filled, Monocarp assigns them to the other position.

Your task is, for each candidate, calculate the skill of the team if everyone
except them comes to interview. Note that it means that exactly n+m candidates
will arrive, so all n+m positions in the company will be filled.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and m (0 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; 2 \le n + m + 1 \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of programmers and the number of testers Monocarp wants to hire, respectively; 
  * the second line contains n + m + 1 integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_{n+m+1} (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the programming skill of the i -th candidate; 
  * the third line contains n + m + 1 integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_{n+m+1} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ; b_i \ne a_i ), where b_i is the testing skill of the i -th candidate. 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of (n + m + 1) over all test cases
doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n + m + 1 integers, where the i -th integer should
be equal to the skill of the team if everyone except the i -th candidate comes
to interview.

Note

Let's consider the third test case of the example:

  * if the 1 -st candidate does not arrive, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 ; 
  * if the 2 -nd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a tester. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 5 + 1 = 11 ; 
  * if the 3 -rd candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 4 -th candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 ; 
  * if the 4 -th candidate does not arrive, the 1 -st candidate gets hired as a tester, the 2 -nd candidate gets hired as a tester, the 3 -rd candidate gets hired as a programmer. The total skill of the team will be 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads in two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n + m + 1 \). It then calculates a list of \( n + m \) values based on specific conditions involving the elements of \( a \) and \( b \). The function identifies the largest values in both lists, determines a type (either 0 or 1) for each position based on the comparison of corresponding elements in \( a \) and \( b \), and adjusts the final result if a particular condition is met. The function outputs the calculated list along with the final value of the sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, followed by the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and the programming and testing skills of each candidate.
   
2. **Candidate Assignment Logic**:
   - The program initializes variables to track the current count of programmers and testers (`cur`).
   - It iterates through each candidate and decides whether to assign them as a programmer or a tester based on their skills. This decision is stored in `types`.
   - If a slot in either category is full and there's no candidate to replace a previously assigned candidate, it marks the first such candidate (`bad`) and the type of replacement needed (`badType`).

3. **Skill Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial team skill by summing up the appropriate skills based on the assignments.
   - For each candidate, it recalculates the team skill by subtracting the candidate's skill from the initial team skill and adding the hypothetical skill of the replacement candidate.
   - If the candidate being removed was a replacement, the program adds the skill of the next available candidate for the required position instead.

4. **Output**:
   - The program constructs a list of team skills for each scenario where one candidate is omitted and prints these values in the required format.

The program's approach aligns with the problem description and handles the logic for assigning candidates and recalculating team skills accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code that would cause incorrect results based on the given constraints and examples.
