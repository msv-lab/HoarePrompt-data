Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, followed by the values of \(n\) and \(m\), and the programming and testing skills of each candidate.
   
2. **Candidate Assignment Logic**:
   - The program initializes variables to track the current count of programmers and testers (`cur`).
   - It iterates through each candidate and decides whether to assign them as a programmer or a tester based on their skills. This decision is stored in `types`.
   - If a slot in either category is full and there's no candidate to replace a previously assigned candidate, it marks the first such candidate (`bad`) and the type of replacement needed (`badType`).

3. **Skill Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial team skill by summing up the appropriate skills based on the assignments.
   - For each candidate, it recalculates the team skill by subtracting the candidate's skill from the initial team skill and adding the hypothetical skill of the replacement candidate.
   - If the candidate being removed was a replacement, the program adds the skill of the next available candidate for the required position instead.

4. **Output**:
   - The program constructs a list of team skills for each scenario where one candidate is omitted and prints these values in the required format.

The program's approach aligns with the problem description and handles the logic for assigning candidates and recalculating team skills accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code that would cause incorrect results based on the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
