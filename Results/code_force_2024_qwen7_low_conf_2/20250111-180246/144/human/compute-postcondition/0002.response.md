The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0. After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged because no input was given for `t` in the code snippet. Therefore, `t` is still within its initial range.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer**
