The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n`, but does not affect the values of the other variables. The initial conditions of `t`, `a`, `z`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\); `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`; `z` is 1 if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` for any \(0 \leq i < n\), otherwise `z` remains 0; `i` is `n`.**
