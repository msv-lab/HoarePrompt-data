To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variable `t` and its constraints. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraints provided, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute as long as `t > 0`.

Since `t` is defined as an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), the only constraint we need to ensure for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0. This condition is inherently satisfied given the problem constraints.

Thus, no further adjustments are needed beyond ensuring `t` is within the specified range, but since it's guaranteed to be between 1 and 5000, we can simply confirm that `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` must be greater than 0**
