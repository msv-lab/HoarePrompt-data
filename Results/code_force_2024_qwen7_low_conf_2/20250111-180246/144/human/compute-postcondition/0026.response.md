The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers, assigning this list to the variable `a`. The previous value of `a` (which was a list derived from conditions involving `z` and `i`) is replaced by the new list obtained from the input.

Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for the input integers, we can denote the elements of the new list `a` as generic integers. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\); `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input; `z` is 1 if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` for any \(0 \leq i < n\), otherwise `z` remains 0; `i` is `n`.**
