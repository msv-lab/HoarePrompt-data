Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`; `z` remains 0; `i` is `previous_i + 1`. If `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `z` remains 0.***
