Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 1 if the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` holds for any `i` in the range `[0, n)`, otherwise `z` is 0, `i` is 0, and either the number 2 or 3 is printed to the console based on the value of `z`.***
