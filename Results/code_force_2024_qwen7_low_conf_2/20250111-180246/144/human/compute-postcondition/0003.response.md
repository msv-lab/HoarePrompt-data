The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each string in the input to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variable `n` remains unchanged from its initial state.

Since the exact input values are not provided, the output state will include the updated list `a` with the integers from the input and the unchanged `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`**
