Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
