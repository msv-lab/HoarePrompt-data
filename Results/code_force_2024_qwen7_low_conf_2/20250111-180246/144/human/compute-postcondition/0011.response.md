The given code sets the variable `z` to 1 without changing any other variables. According to the precondition, `z` is set to 1 if `a[a[previous_i + 1] - 1] == previous_i + 2` is true, otherwise `z` remains 0. Since the code simply assigns `z` to 1, this condition must have been met previously.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`; `z` is 1; `i` is `previous_i + 1`.**
