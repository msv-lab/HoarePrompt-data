Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `z` is 1 if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, otherwise `z` remains 0.

2. **For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - For each iteration, the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `z` is set to 1; otherwise, it remains 0.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is still within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and is greater than 0.
   - `n` remains the same as the input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers obtained from converting the input string.
   - `z` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` from the previous iteration.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `i` was previously incremented (let's assume it was `i = previous_i`), the next value of `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.
- `z` remains the same unless the condition `a[a[previous_i + 1] - 1] == previous_i + 2` evaluates to true.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
- `z` is 1 if `a[a[previous_i + 1] - 1] == previous_i + 2` is true, otherwise `z` remains 0.
- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.

So, the final state for the next iteration is:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `z` is 1 if `a[a[previous_i + 1] - 1] == previous_i + 2` is true, otherwise `z` remains 0, `i` is `previous_i + 1`**.
