The `break` statement does not modify any variables and simply exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement it is in. Since there is no loop or if statement in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the program will exit this specific block of code. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
