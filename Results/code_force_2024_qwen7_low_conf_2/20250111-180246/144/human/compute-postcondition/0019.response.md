Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t\) is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`; `z` is 0 since the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` was never met for any \(0 \leq i < n\); `i` is `n`.***
