The code `z = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `z`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`; `z` is 0**
