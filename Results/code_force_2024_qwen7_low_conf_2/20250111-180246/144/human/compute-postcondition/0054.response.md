The code `break` does not affect the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no loop or if statement in the provided code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `a` is equal to `i + 1`.**
