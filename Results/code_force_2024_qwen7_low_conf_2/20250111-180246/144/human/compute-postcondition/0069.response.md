Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is either 0 or 1 depending on the condition of the if statement, `i` is `n-1` (or less), and for all `i` in the range of `n`, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `a` is equal to `i + 1`. If `z` is 0, the function prints 3; if `z` is 1, the function prints 2.***
