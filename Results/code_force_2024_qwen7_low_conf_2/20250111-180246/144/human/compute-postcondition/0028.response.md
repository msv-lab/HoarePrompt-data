Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\).
   - `n` is the input integer that must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `i` is `n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The for loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already given).

3. **Required Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n`, the loop will start with `i = n` and decrement `i` in each iteration until `i` becomes less than 0. Therefore, the initial value of `i` must be set correctly to ensure the loop starts with the correct condition.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Summary of Required Adjustments:**
   - Ensure `n` is greater than 0.
   - Ensure `i` is set to `n`.

Given these points, the required state adjustments are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 0, `i` is `n`**
