Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `z` is 1, and `i` is 2. If the condition `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no change occurs in the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `z`, and `i`.***
