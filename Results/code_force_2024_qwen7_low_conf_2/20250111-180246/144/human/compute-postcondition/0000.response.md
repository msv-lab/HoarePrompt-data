`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The values of `n` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `p` is a list of n integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct; `t` is the integer input from the user**
