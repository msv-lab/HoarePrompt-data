The code `z = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `z`. Since the initial value of `z` was 1, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is 0**
