The variable `z` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment sets `z` to `0` regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 0, `i` is 0**
