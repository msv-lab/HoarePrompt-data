Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t\) is greater than 0; `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 50 inclusive; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each element \(a_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and all elements are distinct; `z` is 1 if there exists an index \(i\) such that \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\), otherwise `z` is 0; `i` is `n`; either `2` or `3` is printed to the console based on the value of `z`.**
