The code snippet `print(2)` prints the integer `2` to the console. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `z`, or `i`). Therefore, the only change is that the value `2` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t\) is greater than 0; `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`; `z` is 1 if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` for any \(0 \leq i < n\), otherwise `z` remains 0; `i` is the integer `n`; `2` is printed to the console.**
