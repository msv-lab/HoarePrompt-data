Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `z` is 0, and for the index `i`, the value of `a[a[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`***
