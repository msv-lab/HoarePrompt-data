Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the input string to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `z` is 1 if `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, otherwise `z` remains 0.**
