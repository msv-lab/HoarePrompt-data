Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t - 1 > 0\), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers obtained from the input, `z` is 1, `i` is 0. If `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as is when the if condition fails.**
