The function processes multiple test cases (up to 5000). For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) (between 2 and 50) and a list \(a\) of \(n\) integers, where each element \(a_i\) is an integer between 1 and \(n\) (inclusive), and \(a_i \neq i\). It then checks if there exists an index \(i\) such that \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\). If such an index exists, the function prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function ensures that all inputs meet the specified constraints. If the inputs do not meet these constraints, the function will not execute properly due to the lack of error handling for invalid inputs.
