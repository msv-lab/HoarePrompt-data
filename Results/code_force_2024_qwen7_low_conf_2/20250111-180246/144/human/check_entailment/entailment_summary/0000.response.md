Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Monocarp needs to invite friends such that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend \(i\) comes if both \(i\) and their best friend \(p_i\) receive invitations.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed.

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program checks if there exists an index \(i\) such that \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\).
     - This condition means that \(i\) and \(p_i\) form a cycle of length 2, where both are each other's best friend.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2`, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints `3`, suggesting 3 or more invitations are needed.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic assumes that finding a pair \(i\) and \(p_i\) such that \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\) means only 2 invitations are needed. However, this is not always true. Consider the following example:
     - Input: `n = 4` and `a = [2, 1, 4, 3]`
     - Here, no single pair satisfies \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\), but we can invite friends 1 and 3, which would make friends 1 and 3 come to the party.
     - The correct output should be `2`, but the program incorrectly prints `3`.

4. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - The solution needs to identify all cycles in the graph represented by the array `a`.
   - For each cycle, if the cycle length is 2, only 2 invitations are needed.
   - If the cycle length is greater than 2, all friends in that cycle need to be invited.
   - The minimum number of invitations required can be calculated by ensuring at least one friend from each cycle is invited.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as it fails to handle certain cases where fewer than 3 invitations are needed.

Correctness: **False**
