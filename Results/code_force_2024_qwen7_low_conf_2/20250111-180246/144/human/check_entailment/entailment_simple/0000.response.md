Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The program needs to calculate the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the current implementation only checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair exists, otherwise it prints `3`. This is not sufficient to meet the problem requirements.

2. **Logic Error**: The current logic does not account for scenarios where multiple pairs of friends who are each other’s best friends exist. It also does not handle cases where no such pairs exist and requires sending invitations to more than 2 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come.

To illustrate with an example, consider the input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

- For the first test case, the output should be `2` because Monocarp can invite friends 4 and 5, who are each other’s best friends.
- For the second test case, the output should be `3` because no single pair of friends are each other’s best friends, and inviting just 2 friends will not guarantee that at least 2 friends come.
- For the third test case, the output should be `2` because Monocarp can invite friends 1 and 2, who are each other’s best friends.

However, the current program incorrectly prints `2` for the first and third test cases and `3` for the second test case, which does not match the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
