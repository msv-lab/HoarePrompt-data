Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair exists, and `3` otherwise. However, this logic does not always yield the minimum number of invitations required.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

- Expected Output:
```
3
2
```

- Program Output:
```
2
2
```

In the first subcase of the example input, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `3`. The correct minimum number of invitations needed is `3`, because if Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3, both friends 1 and 2 will come to the party. Inviting just two friends is not sufficient because the output requires at least 2 friends to come, and inviting only 2 friends does not guarantee that both pairs will have their best friends invited.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it fails to handle this specific case.
