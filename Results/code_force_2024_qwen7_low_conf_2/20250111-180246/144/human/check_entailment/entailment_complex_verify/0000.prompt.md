You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

        if z == 0:

            print(2)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) and \(t\) is greater than 0; `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 50 inclusive; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, where each element \(a_i\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and all elements are distinct; `z` is 1 if there exists an index \(i\) such that \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\), otherwise `z` is 0; `i` is `n`; either `2` or `3` is printed to the console based on the value of `z`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases (up to 5000). For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) (between 2 and 50) and a list \(a\) of \(n\) integers, where each element \(a_i\) is an integer between 1 and \(n\) (inclusive), and \(a_i \neq i\). It then checks if there exists an index \(i\) such that \(a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1\). If such an index exists, the function prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function ensures that all inputs meet the specified constraints. If the inputs do not meet these constraints, the function will not execute properly due to the lack of error handling for invalid inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair exists, and `3` otherwise. However, this logic does not always yield the minimum number of invitations required.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

- Expected Output:
```
3
2
```

- Program Output:
```
2
2
```

In the first subcase of the example input, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `3`. The correct minimum number of invitations needed is `3`, because if Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3, both friends 1 and 2 will come to the party. Inviting just two friends is not sufficient because the output requires at least 2 friends to come, and inviting only 2 friends does not guarantee that both pairs will have their best friends invited.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it fails to handle this specific case.
