Reasoning:

1. The provided solution iterates through each test case and each friend to check if there is any pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `a[a[i] - 1] == i + 1`).
2. If such a pair exists (`z = 1`), it means that inviting either of these two friends would ensure that both come to the party, requiring only 2 invitations.
3. If no such pair exists, it prints 3, which is stated as a condition where it is impossible to invite fewer than 3 friends such that at least 2 come.

However, upon closer inspection, this logic does not fully satisfy the requirement of minimizing the number of invitations. Here's why:

- The logic correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, but it does not handle the scenario where the friends form a cycle or multiple cycles.
- The solution assumes that finding even one such pair is sufficient to require only 2 invitations, but this might not be the case if the structure of best friends forms more complex relationships (like multiple disjoint cycles).

To properly solve this, we need to consider the structure of the graph formed by friends and their best friends. Specifically, we need to:
- Identify all cycles.
- Ensure that the smallest set of friends to invite covers at least 2 friends from each cycle.

The current solution does not address these complexities. Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly minimize the number of invitations in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
