The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`half` is a list with at least `n` elements, `res1` contains all elements from `half` whose count in `cnts` was 1, plus an additional `ai` for each `ai` where `cnt` was 2, `hs` is the number of unique elements in `half2` with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `wp` equals `wanted_singles`, `hp` equals `wp`, `res2` contains all `ai` from `cnts2` where `cnt == 2`, each `ai` appearing twice, and `cnts2` is a dictionary with the same key-value pairs as the original, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.
