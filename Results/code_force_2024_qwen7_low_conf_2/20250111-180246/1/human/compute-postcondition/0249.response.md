Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
- `t` is greater than `n + 2`.
- `k` is twice the input integer `n`, i.e., `k = 2 * n`.
- `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`.
- `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`.
- `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.
- `v` is equal to `2 * len(g2)` if `len(g2) > 0` and `v` is `0` otherwise.
- `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list.

### For Loop:
```
for x in g1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The for loop iterates over elements in the list `g1`.
- For the loop to execute, `g1` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that there is at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` such that `occ[i] == 1`.

### Required Adjustments:
- We need to ensure that `g1` is not empty. This means there must be at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` such that `occ[i] == 1`.

### Final State:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
- `t` is greater than `n + 2`.
- `k` is twice the input integer `n`, i.e., `k = 2 * n`.
- `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`.
- `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`. **`g1` must not be empty.**
- `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.
- `v` is equal to `2 * len(g2)` if `len(g2) > 0` and `v` is `0` otherwise.
- `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list.

### Answer:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1` and `g1` must not be empty, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is equal to `2 * len(g2)` if `len(g2) > 0` and `v` is `0` otherwise, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list.**
