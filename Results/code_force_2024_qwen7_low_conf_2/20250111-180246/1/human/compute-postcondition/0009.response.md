`occ[x]` is incremented by 1, meaning that the value at index `x` in the list `occ` is increased by 1. All other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `x` is 1 more than its original value and all other elements are 0.**
