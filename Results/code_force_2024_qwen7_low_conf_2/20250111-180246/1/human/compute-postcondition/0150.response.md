Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'` repeated `v/2` times, `v` is `2 * len(g2)` if the loop executed, otherwise `0`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to process elements in `g2` until `v` (which starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time an element is processed) reaches `k`.
- Each iteration of the loop appends the string `f'{x} {x}'` to `output` and increments `v` by 2.
- Once `v` reaches `k`, no further iterations occur.
- `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, so if there are no such elements (`g2` is empty), the loop does not execute.
- `output` will contain the string `f'{x} {x}'` repeated `v/2` times, where `v` is the total number of elements processed, which is `2 * len(g2)` if the loop executed.
- If the loop did not execute, `v` remains 0, and `output` remains an empty list.
