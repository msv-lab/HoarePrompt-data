Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing strings `'x x'` for each `x` in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `total` is 0.
  - `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
  - `n` is an integer from the input.
  - `k` is \(2 \times n\).
  - `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
  - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0.
  - `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
  - `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
  - `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`.
  - `i` is \(n + 1\).
  - `output` is an empty list.

- **Loop Code**:
  - The loop iterates over the elements in `g0`.
  - For each `x` in `g0`, if `v < k`, `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` and `v += 2`.

- **Final State**:
  - After all iterations of the loop, `g0` will become an empty list because the loop will process each `x` in `g0` until `g0` is empty.
  - Since `v` starts at 0 and increments by 2 for each valid `x` in `g0` as long as `v < k`, eventually `v` will reach `k` and the loop will terminate.
  - When `g0` is empty, `v` will be at least `k` (since each valid `x` was processed and `v` was incremented by 2 for each `x`).
  - Therefore, `g0` will be an empty list, `g1` will be an empty list (since all `occ[i]` were 0 initially and none became 1 during the loop), and `g2` will be a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`.
  - The value of `output` will be a list of strings `'x x'` for each `x` in `g0` if `v < k` before processing all `x` in `g0`. Once `v` reaches `k`, no more elements are appended to `output`.

Thus, the final state of the variables is as described above.
