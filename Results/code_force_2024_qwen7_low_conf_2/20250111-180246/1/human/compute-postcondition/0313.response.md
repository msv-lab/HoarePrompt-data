According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `cnts`. The loop continues as long as `cnts` contains at least one key-value pair.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair.
- `cnt` is either 1 or not 1.
- If `cnt` is 1, then `singles` is 1 more than its initial value.
- If `cnt` is not 1, then `pairs` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `cnts` must still contain at least one key-value pair.
- `num` and `cnt` from the current iteration will be used, but we don't know their specific values yet.
- Depending on the value of `cnt`:
  - If `cnt` is 1, `singles` will be incremented by 1.
  - If `cnt` is not 1, `pairs` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `cnts` must still contain at least one key-value pair.
- `cnt` is either 1 or not 1.
- If `cnt` is 1, `singles` will be incremented by 1.
- If `cnt` is not 1, `pairs` will be incremented by 1.

State: **`cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is either 1 or not 1. If `cnt` is 1, then `singles` is 1 more than its current value. If `cnt` is not 1, then `pairs` is increased by 1.**
