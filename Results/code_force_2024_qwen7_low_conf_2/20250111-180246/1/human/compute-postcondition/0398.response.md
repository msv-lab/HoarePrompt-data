`hp` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `wp + 1`. The other variables (`cnts`, `wp`, `cnt`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` equals `wp + 1`, `wp` equals `hp`, `cnt` equals 2.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` equals `wp + 1`, `wp` equals `hp`, `cnt` equals 2**
