Postcondition: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (excluding the current key-value pair `(ai, cnt)`), `hp` is 1, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, and `res2` is updated based on the condition `if cnt == 2: res2.append(ai * 2)`. Since `hp == wp`, the condition is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
