`g1` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `occ[i]` is equal to 1 and no other operations are performed on `occ`, `total`, `t`, `a`, `g0`, `g2`, `output`, or `v`, these variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g2` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is \(n + 1\), `g1` contains the value `i`, and `occ[i]` is equal to 1.
