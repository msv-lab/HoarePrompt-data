`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. This means that the value at the index `x` in the list `occ` will be updated. Initially, the element at index `x` was 1 more than its original value (which was 0), so it is now 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `x` is 2 and all other elements are 0, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**
