`res2` is appended with the value of `ai`. The value of `ai` is not specified, so let's denote it as `ai_value`. Since `res2` originally contained `ai` appended to it, now it will contain `ai` twice. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 1, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, `cnt` equals 2; `res2` contains `ai` appended to it twice.**
