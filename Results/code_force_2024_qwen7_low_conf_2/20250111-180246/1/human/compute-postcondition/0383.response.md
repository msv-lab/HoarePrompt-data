Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `res2` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `hs` is `1` (if `cnts[ai] == 1`) or increased by 1, and the loop continues if `hs < ws`. If `cnts[ai] == 1`, then `res1` and `res2` contain `ai`, and `hs` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `res1` and `res2` remain unchanged and `hs` is incremented by 1.***
