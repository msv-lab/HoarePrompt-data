According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `k` is twice the integer from the input.
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is 1 and all other elements are 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `a` must still contain at least one element. After processing the current element `x` in the loop, the list `a` will lose that element.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- `a` will have one less element, but it must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is 1 and all other elements are 0**
