To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and identify what is needed for the loop to start:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute for each element `x` in `g1`.
2. **Initial States**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `k` is \(2 \times n\).
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
   - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0.
   - `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
   - `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
   - `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k` and `v` is `2 \times |g2|` if all elements in `g2` were processed, otherwise `v` is less than `k`.

The key part of the loop is iterating over `g1`. For the loop to execute, `g1` must contain at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- The loop will iterate over `g1`.
- `g1` contains all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute, there must be at least one index `i` for which `occ[i] == 1`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `g1` is non-empty, meaning there must be at least one index `i` for which `occ[i] == 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k` and `v` is `2 \times |g2|` if all elements in `g2` were processed, otherwise `v` is less than `k` and `output` contains those processed pairs.**
