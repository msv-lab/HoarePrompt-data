The code snippet `print(' '.join(output))` does not change the values of any variables. Instead, it prints the contents of the `output` list in a formatted string. Since no new operations are performed on the variables, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'i i' such that each pair consists of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k`, `g1` must be empty if the loop does not execute or must contain elements otherwise; for each iteration, `v` is increased by 1 if `v < k`. The code simply prints the contents of `output` in a space-separated string format.**
