The code snippet appends a formatted string containing the value of `x` to the list `output`. Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `x` is part of a pair `(x x)` that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `g0` is empty
- `output` contains pairs of integers `(x x)` such that each pair consists of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k`, and `g1` must contain at least one element

The code snippet only appends a formatted string of `x` to `output`. This means that the pairs in `output` will now include an additional entry with just the integer `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can only state that the formatted string of `x` is appended to `output`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' plus an additional entry 'x', and `g1` must contain at least one element**
