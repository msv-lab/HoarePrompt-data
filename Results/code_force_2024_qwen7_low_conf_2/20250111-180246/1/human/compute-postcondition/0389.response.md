The code snippet `res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. Since no specific value for `ai` is given, we will keep it as `ai`. Other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. The output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai`, `res2` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai`, `hs` is `hs + 1`, `res2` is updated by appending `ai`**
