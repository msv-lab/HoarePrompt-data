`pairs` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnts` remains unchanged, and `cnt` remains not equal to 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is not equal to 1, and `pairs` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is not equal to 1, and `pairs` is increased by 1**
