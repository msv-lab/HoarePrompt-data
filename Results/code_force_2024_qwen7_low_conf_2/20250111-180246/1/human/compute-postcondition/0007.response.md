The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value at index `x` in the list `occ` by 1. Since `occ` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, the value at index `x` (where `x` is an element of `a`) will become 1.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where the element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is 1 and all other elements are 0**
