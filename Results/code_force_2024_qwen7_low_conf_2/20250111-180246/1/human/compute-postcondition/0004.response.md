The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation. The value of `k` remains unchanged because it was defined before the code snippet and its calculation does not depend on the input provided here.

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
