The code `occ[x] += 1` increments the value of `occ[x]` by 1. Given the initial state where `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, the value of `x` is an integer from the input, and since `occ[x]` was initially 0, after this operation, `occ[x]` will be 1.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(4 \times n\), `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) decreased by 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` must have at least one element, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0 except `occ[x]` which is 1, `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`, `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged, `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times, `occ` is now `[0, 0, ..., 0]` with the exception of `occ[x]` which is 1.**
