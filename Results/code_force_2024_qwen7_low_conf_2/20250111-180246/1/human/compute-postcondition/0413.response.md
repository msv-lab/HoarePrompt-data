`res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. This operation modifies the list `res1` by adding `ai` to it, but it does not change the values of `cnts`, `hp`, or `wp`. The value of `hp` remains as `cnts[ai] + 1`, and `wp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least four items; `hp` is `cnts[ai]` + 1; `wp` equals `wp`; `res1` is a list with `ai` appended to it.**
