Postcondition: ***`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (at least one key-value pair remaining), `hp` is 2, `wp` is 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, and `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it, if `cnt == 2` for the current iteration. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged since there is no operation in the else part.***
