Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is not equal to 0.***

This postcondition covers both cases: when `occ[i] == 1` and when `occ[i] != 1`, summarizing the final state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.
