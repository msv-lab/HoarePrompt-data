To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements of the `for` loop statement and analyze the given initial states.

### Given States:
- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is twice the input integer `n` (so `k = 2 * n`)
- `t` must be greater than `n + 2`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `0`

### For Loop:
```
for x in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop can execute if the list `a` is non-empty.

2. **Initial State Check**:
   - `i` is `n + 2`: This variable is not directly related to the loop execution, so no adjustment is needed for this.
   - `n` is an input integer: This is a necessary part of the state but does not affect the loop directly.
   - `k` is `2 * n`: This is derived from `n` and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `t` must be greater than `n + 2`: This condition is independent of the loop execution but may be relevant for other parts of the program.
   - `a` is a list of integers: For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.
   - `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `0`: This list does not affect the loop's ability to iterate over `a`.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that the list `a` must contain at least one element.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers**
