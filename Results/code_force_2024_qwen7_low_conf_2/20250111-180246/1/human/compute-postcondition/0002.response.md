The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts those parts into integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the initial state of `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, the value of `t` remains unchanged in this operation. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**
