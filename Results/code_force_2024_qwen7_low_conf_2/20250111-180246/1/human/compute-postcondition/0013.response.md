The code initializes three empty lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `occ`. Therefore, the output state will include these variables unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list.**
