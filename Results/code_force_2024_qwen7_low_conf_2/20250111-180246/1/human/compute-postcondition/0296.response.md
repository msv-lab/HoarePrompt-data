The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in the given function signature but presumably works with global variables or takes in parameters through other means not shown here. However, based on the provided constraints and expected behavior:

- There is a variable `t` which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- For each test case, there are two integers `n` and `k` where \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \times 10^4\) and \(1 \leq k \leq \lfloor n/2 \rfloor\).
- There is an array `a` which is a list of \(2n\) integers where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice.

The function likely processes these inputs and returns some output based on the given conditions. Since the exact return type or value is not specified in the output part, we can infer that the function might return some form of result based on the processing of the array `a`.

Given the information, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters implicitly through global variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, and returns a result based on the processing of the array `a` according to the given constraints.**
