Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0, `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`, `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged, `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `g1`. Each time the loop runs, it checks if `v < k` and appends `x` (an element from `g1`) to `output` if this condition is met. After appending, `v` is incremented by 1.
- Since `g1` is a non-empty list initially and the loop continues until `g1` becomes empty, the loop will run `len(g1)` times.
- After all iterations of the loop, `g1` will be empty because all its elements have been processed.
- The variable `v` will be equal to `len(g1) + 1` which is `n + 1` if the loop executed `n` times.
- The variable `output` will contain the string representations of all elements in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Since `g1` becomes empty after all iterations, the loop stops, and `v` reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, the final state of the variables is as described above.
