To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop body will run. The loop will execute if there are elements in `g2`, which contains elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1.

Let's break down the requirements:

1. **State of `g2`:**
   - For the loop to execute, `g2` must contain at least one element. This means there must be at least one element in `a` whose occurrence is greater than 1.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - The values of `total`, `t`, `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `output`, `v`, and `i` do not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute. However, they should remain consistent with their current states unless specifically required for the loop body logic.

Given this analysis, the critical adjustment needed is ensuring that `g2` is non-empty.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element, `g2` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is an empty list, `v` is 0, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list**.
