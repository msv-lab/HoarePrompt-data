`g1` is a list that appends the current value of `i` to itself. Given that `i` is updated to `i_prev + 1` before this line, `i` will be the next integer after `i_prev`. The exact value of `i` is not specified, but it follows that `g1` now includes this new value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing the value of `i` if `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1` plus the newly appended value of `i`, `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.**
