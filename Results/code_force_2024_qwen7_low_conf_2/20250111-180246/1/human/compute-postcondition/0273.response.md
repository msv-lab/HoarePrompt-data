The value of `v` is incremented by 2, making `v` at least `k + 4` (since it was not less than `k + 2` and has now increased by 2). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g0` is not empty, there exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the state of `v` is `k + 4`; `output` contains a string 'x x'.**
