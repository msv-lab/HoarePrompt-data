The code snippet `output.append(f'{x}')` does not affect the variables `v` and `k`. It appends a formatted string containing the value of `x` to the list `output`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `x`, it remains unspecified. The output state after executing the code will include the updated `output` list.

Output State: **`v` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and `v` is less than `k`; `output` is a list with one element being the string representation of `x`**
