`res1` appends the value of `ai` to itself. The value of `ai` is the key of the third item in the dictionary `cnts`. Other variables are not directly affected by this operation, but the value of `res1` changes.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least three items, where `ai` is the key of the third item in the dictionary, and `cnt` is the value of the third item in the dictionary; `hp` is increased by 1; `res1` contains the key `ai` and an additional element `ai`.**
