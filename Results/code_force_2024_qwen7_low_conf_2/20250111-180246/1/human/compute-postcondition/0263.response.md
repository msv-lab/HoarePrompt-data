The code snippet `print(' '.join(output))` does not change the values of any variables. It simply joins the elements of the `output` list into a single string separated by spaces and prints that string. Therefore, the only change is the print statement itself.

Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are being modified within the provided code snippet, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the print statement which will execute and print the contents of the `output` list.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is `len(g2) + 1` if `v < k` and `1` if `v >= k`, `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` is an empty list, and the string `' '.join(output)` is printed.**
