`g2` is appended with the value `i`. The value of `i` is the same as the indices in the list `occ` which are not equal to 0 and at least one of these indices is not equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list appended with `i`, `n` is a positive integer, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is not equal to 0, and there exists at least one index `i` in `occ` such that `occ[i]` is not equal to 1**
