According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `total` is 0
- `t` is unchanged
- `a` is an empty list
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros
- `g0` and `g1` are all empty lists
- `output` is empty
- `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body
- `i` is an index such that `occ[i] == 0`. If `occ[i]` equals 0, then `g0` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `g1` or `g2` contains the value `i` based on whether `occ[i]` is 1 or more than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Since `i` was an index such that `occ[i] == 0` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to check if `occ[i + 1] == 0` for the next iteration. If `occ[i + 1]` equals 0, then `g0` will contain the value of `i + 1`. Otherwise, `g1` or `g2` will contain the value `i + 1` based on whether `occ[i + 1]` is 1 or more than 1.

The other states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is an index such that `occ[i + 1] == 0`. If `occ[i + 1]` equals 0, then `g0` contains the value of `i + 1`. Otherwise, `g1` or `g2` contains the value `i + 1` based on whether `occ[i + 1]` is 1 or more than 1.**
