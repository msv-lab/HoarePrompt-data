`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. This means that the value of `occ[x]` increases by 1. The value of `a` remains unchanged because the code does not affect the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers minus one element, `occ[x]` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `occ[x]` is the original value of `occ[x]` plus 1)**
