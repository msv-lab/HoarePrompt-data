Postcondition: ***`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 1, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`. If `cnt` equals 2, `res2` contains `ai` appended to it twice. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged from the precondition.***
