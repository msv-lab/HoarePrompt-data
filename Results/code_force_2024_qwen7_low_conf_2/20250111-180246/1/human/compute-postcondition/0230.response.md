Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `occ[2]` retains its previous value. If `occ[i]` equals 1, `g1` is a list containing 3. Otherwise, `i` is now part of `g2` and `g2` is `[3]`.***
