The code initializes `output` as an empty list. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `output` and retain the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is an empty list, `v` is 0, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**
