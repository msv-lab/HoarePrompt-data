The code snippet appends the string representation of `x` (which is the next element in `g1`) to the list `output`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x`, we will consider the general case.

- `total` is 0 (unchanged).
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) (unchanged).
- `n` is an integer from the input (unchanged).
- `k` is \(2 \times n\) (unchanged).
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input (unchanged).
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0 (unchanged).
- `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k` (unchanged).
- `g1` is a non-empty list (unchanged).
- `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0` (unchanged).
- `output` is a list containing strings `'x x'` for each `x` in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged (the code only adds one more element to this list).
- `x` is the next element in `g1` (changes).

The output state after executing the code is:
- `total` is 0.
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `k` is \(2 \times n\).
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0.
- `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k`.
- `g1` is a non-empty list.
- `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`.
- `output` is a list containing strings `'x x'` for each `x` in `g0` if `v < k`, plus the string representation of `x` (the next element in `g1`).
- `x` is the next element in `g1`.
