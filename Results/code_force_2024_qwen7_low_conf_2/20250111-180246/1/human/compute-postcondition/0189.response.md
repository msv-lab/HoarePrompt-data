The value of `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'`. The code snippet `v += 1` increments the value of `v` by 1. Since `v` was not defined in the initial state, it means `v` is being initialized or incremented here. The output state should reflect this change.

Output State: **`output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'`, `v` is incremented by 1**
