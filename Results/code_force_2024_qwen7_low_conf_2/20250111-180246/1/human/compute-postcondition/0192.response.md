The code `output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` to the list `output`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `v`, `k`, and `x`, we will consider the conditions given in the initial state.

- `v` is incremented by 1.
- If `v < k` still holds, then `output` contains the string `f'{x}'`.
- If `v >= k`, then `output` and `v` remain unchanged.

Since the code `output.append(f'{x}')` is executed, `x` is appended to `output`, regardless of whether `v < k` or `v >= k`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `v` is incremented by 1.
- `output` contains the string `f'{x}'`.

Output State: **`v` is incremented by 1; `output` contains the string `f'{x}'`**
