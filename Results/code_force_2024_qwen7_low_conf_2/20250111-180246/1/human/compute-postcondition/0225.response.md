Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`. If `occ[2]` is 0, then `g0` is `[2]`, `g1` is either [1] or an empty list, and `g2` is either an empty list or [1]. If `occ[2]` is 1, then `g1` is either [1] or an empty list plus 2, and `g2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `g2` is set to `[2]` and `g1` remains unchanged.***
