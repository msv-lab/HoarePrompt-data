The code provided does not actually modify any of the variables listed in the initial state. It simply prints the contents of the `output` list using `' '.join(output)`. Since no modifications are made to `output` or any other variable within the provided code snippet, the state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0, `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`, `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged, `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times.**
