The code initializes the list `occ` with \(n + 1\) zeros. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is 0; `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) decreased by 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is \(4 \times n\); `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\) decreased by 1; `n` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0; `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k`; `g1` is an empty list; `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`; `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged; `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times; `occ` is now `[0, 0, ..., 0]` (with \(n + 1\) zeros).**
