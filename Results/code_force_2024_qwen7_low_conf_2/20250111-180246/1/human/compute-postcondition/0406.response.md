`res1` is appended with the key `ai` from the dictionary `cnts`. The value of `ai` is the key of the third item in the dictionary `cnts`. The value of `hp` is increased by 1, but the exact value of `hp` is not given, so we keep it as `hp` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least three items, where `ai` is the key of the third item in the dictionary, and `cnt` is the value of the third item in the dictionary; `hp` is increased by 1; `res1` contains the key `ai`.**
