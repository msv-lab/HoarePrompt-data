The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a string formatted as `'x x'` to the list `output`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the provided initial state, and no value is assigned to `x` within the given code snippet. Therefore, the exact content of the appended string cannot be determined without knowing the value of `x`.

Given the initial state, the only affected variable is `output`, which is appended with a string. Since the value of `x` is not specified, we can only state that a string `'x x'` is added to the `output` list.

Output State: **`g0` is not empty, there exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the state of `v` either remains unchanged or is not less than `k + 2`; `output` contains a string 'x x'.**
