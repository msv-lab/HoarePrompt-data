The code `g1.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. In the initial state, `g1` is an empty list. After executing this line of code, `i` is appended to `g1`.

Since the value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact numerical value, but we know it is an integer that meets the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is now `[i]`, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is not equal to 0. The condition `occ[i] == 1` is true for some index `i`.**
