The code initializes a list `occ` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. The list `occ` is now created and initialized, but its contents are not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
