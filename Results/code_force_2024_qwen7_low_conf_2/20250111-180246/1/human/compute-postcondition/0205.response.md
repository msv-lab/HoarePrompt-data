`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. This means that the value of `occ[x]` increases by 1 from its previous value. The list `a` remains unchanged, as the code only affects `occ[x]`. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1 (specifically, `occ[x]` is now `occ[x] + 1`)**
