Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- For each `i` in this range:
  - If `occ[i] == 0`, `i` is appended to `g0`.
  - If `occ[i] == 1`, `i` is appended to `g1`.
  - If `occ[i] >= 2`, `i` is appended to `g2`.

After the loop completes all iterations, all integers `i` from 1 to `n` will be categorized into `g0`, `g1`, or `g2` based on their occurrence count in the list `occ`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), then `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` will remain as empty lists since no integers from 1 to `n` exist in this case.
