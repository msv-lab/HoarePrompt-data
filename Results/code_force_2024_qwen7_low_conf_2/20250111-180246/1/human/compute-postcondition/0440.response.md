Postcondition: ***`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 3, `wp` is 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, and `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it.***

Explanation: Since the else part does not perform any operations, the state of the program remains unchanged if `cnt != 2`. However, if `cnt == 2`, then `hp` changes to 3, and `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it. In both cases, the overall postcondition includes the changes made when `cnt == 2` because this is the only scenario that affects the state of the program.
