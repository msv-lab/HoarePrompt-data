`singles` is incremented by 1, regardless of the value of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` and the relationship between `singles` and `pairs` based on the value of `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, if `cnt` is 1, `singles` was originally 3 more than `singles` is now, and `pairs` was increased by 1. If `cnt` is not 1, `singles` was originally 2 more than `singles` is now, and `pairs` was increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is either 1 or not 1, `singles` is 2 more than its original value, and `pairs` is increased by 1.**
