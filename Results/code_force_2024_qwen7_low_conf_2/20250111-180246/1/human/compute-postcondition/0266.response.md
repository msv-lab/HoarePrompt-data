To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the elements in the list `g0`. For the loop to execute, `g0` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `g0` should not be empty.

2. **State Before the Loop Starts**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
   - `t` is greater than `n + 2`.
   - `k` is twice the input integer `n`.
   - `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`.
   - `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`.
   - `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.
   - `v` is 0.
   - `output` is an empty list.
   - The string `' '.join(output)` is printed.

3. **Identifying Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `g0` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that there exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` such that `occ[i] == 0`.

4. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `g0` must not be empty, which means there must be at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`.

Therefore, the state to adjust for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`g0` is not empty (i.e., there exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`)**
