`g0.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Given that `i` is an index from the list `a`, and considering the initial state, `i` is one of the elements present in the list `a`. Since no specific value of `i` is provided, `i` remains as an index from the list `a`.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged except for `g0`, which now includes the value of `i` appended to it.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing the value of `i`, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, and for the index `i` in `occ`, the current value of `occ[i]` is 0**.
