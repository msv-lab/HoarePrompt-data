Postcondition: ***`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' such that each pair consists of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k`, and `g1` must contain at least one element; `v` is increased by 1 if `v` was less than `k`.***
