Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai`, `res2` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai`, `hs` is `hs + 1`, and `res2` is updated by appending `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`. If `hs` equals `ws`, the loop breaks and the function proceeds with the updated values of `cnts`, `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, `wp`, `k`, `res1`, `res2`, and `hs`. If `hs` does not equal `ws`, the values remain unchanged.***
