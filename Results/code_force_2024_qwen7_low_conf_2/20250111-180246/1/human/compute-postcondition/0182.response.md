Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over elements in `g1`. Therefore, the state needs to specify that `g1` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `t` is unchanged (no specific value given).
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros.
   - `g0` is an empty list.
   - `g1` is an empty list.
   - `g2` is a list containing all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1.
   - `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` repeated for each element in `g0` until all elements in `g0` have been processed.
   - `v` is `k`.
   - `i` is the length of `occ` (which is \(n + 1\)).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `g1` must contain at least one element. If `g1` is empty, the loop will not run.

4. **Other Variables**: Since the loop only depends on `g1` and does not directly interact with the other variables mentioned (`total`, `t`, `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g2`, `output`, `v`, `i`), we don't need to adjust their states for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the necessary state adjustment is:

State: **`g1` must contain at least one element**.
