The code initializes three empty lists `g0`, `g1`, and `g2`. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list.**
