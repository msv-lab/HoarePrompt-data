The code snippet `res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `ai`, so we will keep it as `ai` in the output state.

The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is in `res2`, which now includes the new element `ai`.

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (at least one key-value pair remaining), `hp` is 3, `wp` is 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it**
