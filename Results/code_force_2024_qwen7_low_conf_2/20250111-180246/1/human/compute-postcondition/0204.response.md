According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `a` is a non-empty list. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a non-empty list, and `occ[x]` is incremented by 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The list `a` must still be a non-empty list.
2. The variable `x` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.
3. `occ[x]` will be incremented by 1 again in the next iteration.

Since the list `a` is non-empty, it will still be non-empty at the start of the next iteration unless all elements have been processed. However, without additional information about the specific elements in the list, we can only confirm that `a` remains non-empty.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
