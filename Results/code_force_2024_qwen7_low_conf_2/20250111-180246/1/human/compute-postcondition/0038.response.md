The given code initializes an empty list `output`. No operations are performed on the existing variables, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the addition of the empty list `output`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `v` is 0, `output` is an empty list**.
