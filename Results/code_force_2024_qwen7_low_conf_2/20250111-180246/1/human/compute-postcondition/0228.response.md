The code appends the value of `i` to the list `g1`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the list `g1` will now contain this value. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `occ[2]` retains its previous value, `g1` is a list containing 3.**
