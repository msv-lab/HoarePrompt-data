Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n + 1`, `output` is a list with an additional string `f'{v} {v}'` appended to it if `v < k`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `v` is incremented by 2 if `v < k`.***
