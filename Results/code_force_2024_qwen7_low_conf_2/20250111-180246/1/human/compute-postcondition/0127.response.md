Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body. If `occ[i + 1]` equals 0, `g0` contains the value of `i + 1`. If `occ[i + 1]` equals 1, `g1` contains the value `i + 1`. Otherwise, `g2` contains the value `i + 1`.***
