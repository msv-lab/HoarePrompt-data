The value of `v` is incremented by 2. Since the exact initial value of `v` is not specified, we only know that `v` was greater than `n + 2` initially and now it is increased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is `v + 2`, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list.**
