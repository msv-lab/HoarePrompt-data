`v` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `v` is equal to `v + 1` if `v < k`. Since `v` is incremented by 1, this condition will still hold true if `v` was less than `k` before the increment. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' plus an additional entry 'x' if `v < k`, `g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is equal to `v + 1` if `v < k`.

Output State: **`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' plus an additional entry 'x' if `v < k`, `g1` must contain at least one element, `v` is equal to `v + 1` if `v < k`**
