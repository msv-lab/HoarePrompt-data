Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `total` is 0.
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `k` is \(2 \times n\).
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0.
- `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
- `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
- `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`.
- `i` is \(n + 1\).
- `output` is an empty list.

### Loop Statement:
```
for x in g0:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `x`:**
   - The loop iterates over elements in the list `g0`.
   - For the loop to execute, `g0` must contain at least one element.

2. **List `g0`:**
   - `g0` contains indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
   - Therefore, for `g0` to be non-empty, there must be at least one index `i` in the range `[0, n]` such that `occ[i] == 0`.

3. **List `occ`:**
   - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements.
   - Each element `occ[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`.
   - For `g0` to be non-empty, there must be at least one `i` in the range `[0, n]` for which `occ[i] == 0`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `total`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `g1`, `g2`, `i`, and `output` do not directly affect whether the loop `for x in g0:` can execute. They are either constants or initialized based on the input, but they don't influence the condition of `g0` being non-empty.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop `for x in g0:` can execute, we need to ensure that `g0` is non-empty, meaning there must be at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0, `g0` is a non-empty list, `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is an empty list.**
