The code `k = 2 * k` doubles the value of `k`. The original value of `k` was an input integer. After executing this line of code, `k` is now twice its original value. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` must be greater than `n + 2` is still valid.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the input integer `k`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`**
