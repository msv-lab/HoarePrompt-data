The code initializes a list `occ` with `n + 1` zeros. This means `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `0`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is `0`**
