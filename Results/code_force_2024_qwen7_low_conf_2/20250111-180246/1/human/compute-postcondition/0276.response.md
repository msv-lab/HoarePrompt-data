`output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a string containing `x` repeated twice to the list `output`. Since `g0` is not empty, it remains unchanged. The value of `x` is used in the string formatting but its specific value is not provided, so it will remain as `x` in the updated state.

Output State: **`g0` is not empty, `output` contains the string `'x x'` and `x` is unchanged**
