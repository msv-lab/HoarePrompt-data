Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1` and `g1` must have at least two elements, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is 1, and `output` is an empty list if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` contains the strings `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2` plus one additional string `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`.***
