The variable `v` is incremented by 2, changing its value from less than `k` to `v + 2`. The other variables (`g0`, `occ`, `i`, `output`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only modifies `v`.

Output State: **`g0` is not empty, there exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, the current value of `v` is less than `k` + 2, `output` contains the string `'x x'`**
