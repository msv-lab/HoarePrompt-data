The code appends a formatted string to the `output` list. Specifically, it adds the string `'x x'` to the `output` list. However, the code does not define the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`, we can denote `x` as a placeholder for an unspecified value.

The other variables (`g0`, `occ`, `v`, `k`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their initial states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g0` is not empty, there exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, the current value of `v` is less than `k`, `output` contains the string `'x x'`**
