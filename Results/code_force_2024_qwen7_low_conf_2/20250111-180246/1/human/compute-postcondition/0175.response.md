The value of `v` is incremented by 2. The initial state shows that `v` is less than `k` and equals `v + 2`. After executing `v += 2`, `v` will be equal to `v + 2 + 2` which simplifies to `v + 4`. Since `v` was less than `k` before, it remains less than `k` after the increment.

All other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` must contain at least two elements, `g1` is irrelevant, `g2` is irrelevant, `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` and `f'{x} {x}'`, `v` is less than `k` and equals `v + 4`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list**
