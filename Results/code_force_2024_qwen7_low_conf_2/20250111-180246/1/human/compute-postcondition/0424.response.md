`res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. However, the value of `ai` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains unknown. The only change made by the code is appending `ai` to `res2`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 1, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, and `cnt` equals 2; `res2` contains `ai` appended to it.**
