Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is an index such that `occ[i] == 0`. If `occ[i]` equals 0, then `g0` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `g1` or `g2` contains the value `i` based on whether `occ[i]` is 1 or more than 1.***
