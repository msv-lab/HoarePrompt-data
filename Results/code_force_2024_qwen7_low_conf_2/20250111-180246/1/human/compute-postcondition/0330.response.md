The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the `continue` statement does not modify any variables or the state of the program. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `False`, `ws` is `0`, `wp` is `0`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and the difference `(k - wanted_singles)` is odd.**
