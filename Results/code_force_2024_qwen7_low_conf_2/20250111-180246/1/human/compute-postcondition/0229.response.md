The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3. Therefore, `g2` will now contain the value 3.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state: `n` is at least 3, `i` is now part of `g2`, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, and `occ[2]` retains its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3 and is now part of `g2`, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `occ[2]` retains its previous value, `g2` is `[3]`**
