The code `g0.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `g0`. Given the precondition, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `g0` is a list containing the previously stored value of `i` plus the current value of `i`. Therefore, the new value of `g0` will be the list containing the previous value of `i` plus the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1`).

The output state will be:
- `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `k` is twice the integer from the input.
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`.
- `g0` is a list containing the previously stored value of `i` plus the current value of `i` (which is `i_prev + 1`).
- `g1` is a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1` with possibly the newly appended value of `i`.
- `g2` is a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1` with possibly the updated value of `i`.
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- For all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1. If `occ[i] == 0`, `g0` will include the current `i`. If `occ[i] == 1`, `g1` will include the current `i`. Otherwise, `g2` will include the current `i`.
