The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the provided code snippet is within a loop and no loop structure (like `for` or `while`) was explicitly given, we assume it is inside a loop. The `continue` statement itself does not change the values of any variables; it merely moves to the next iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `continue` statement does not modify any variables:

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles + 1`, `wp` is equal to `(k - ((wanted_singles + 1) + 1)) >> 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the difference `(k - ((wanted_singles + 1) + 1))` remains odd, and `wanted_pairs` is `(k - ((wanted_singles + 1) + 1)) >> 1`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
