The variable `v` is assigned the value `0`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `v` and retains the values of all other variables from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is 0.**
