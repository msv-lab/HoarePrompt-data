Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `g0` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` remains unchanged, `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times, otherwise `v` is updated based on the condition inside the loop, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**
