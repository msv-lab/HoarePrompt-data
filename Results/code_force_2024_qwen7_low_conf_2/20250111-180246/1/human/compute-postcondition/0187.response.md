Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `g1` contains at least one element.
   - `output` is a list including an additional element which is a string formatted to include the value of `x`. This happens if and only if `v` is less than `k` + 1. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in g1:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g1`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `v` is less than `k` + 1.
   - If `v < k + 1`, it appends a string formatted to include the value of `x` to `output`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `g1` contains at least one element.
   - `output` includes an additional element which is a string formatted to include the value of `x`, if `v < k + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one element left in `g1`.
   - Since `g1` initially contained at least one element, after removing one element during the current iteration (if applicable), it still needs to contain at least one element for the next iteration.

6. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - If `v < k + 1`, then `output` will include an additional element.
   - For the loop to continue, `g1` should still have at least one element, and the condition `v < k + 1` must be true for the next element in `g1`.

7. **Updated States:**
   - `g1` must still contain at least one element.
   - `output` will include an additional element if `v < k + 1` for the next element in `g1`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `g1` must contain at least one element.
- `output` will include an additional element if `v < k + 1` for the next element in `g1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`g1` must contain at least one element, `output` is a list including an additional element which is a string formatted to include the value of `x` if `v` is less than `k` + 1**.
