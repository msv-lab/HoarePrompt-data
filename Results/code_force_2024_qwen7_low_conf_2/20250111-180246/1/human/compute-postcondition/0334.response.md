The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not specify which loop this statement is part of, and none of the variables are modified within the `continue` statement itself. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `False`, `ws` is `0`, `wp` is `0`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the difference `(k - wanted_singles)` remains odd, and `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) >> 1`. Additionally, the value of `wanted_pairs` is greater than the current value of `pairs`.**
