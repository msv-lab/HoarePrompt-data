`g0` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their original values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing the value 1, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list, the current value of `occ[i]` is 0.
