`singles` is incremented by 1. If `cnt` was 1, then `singles` was already 1 more than its current value before this line, so now it is 2 more than its original value. If `cnt` was not 1, then `pairs` was increased by 1. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair still holds.

Output State: **`cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is either 1 or not 1, `singles` is 2 more than its original value, `pairs` is increased by 1 if `cnt` was not 1.**
