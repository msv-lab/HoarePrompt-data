`pairs` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` is either 1 or not 1, which impacts the values of `singles` and `pairs`. If `cnt` is 1, `singles` is 3 more than its original value, and `pairs` is increased by 1 (already done). If `cnt` is not 1, `singles` is 2 more than its original value, and `pairs` is increased by 1 (already done). Therefore, the only change is in `pairs`.

Output State: **`cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is either 1 or not 1, `singles` is either `singles` + 2 or `singles` + 3, `pairs` is `pairs` + 1**
