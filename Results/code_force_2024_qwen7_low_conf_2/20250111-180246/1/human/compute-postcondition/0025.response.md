The code appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Since `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`, and `i_prev` was not updated before this line, we need to use the previous value of `i`. From the initial state, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, so appending `i` means `g0` will now contain the current value of `i`.

The other variables remain unchanged: `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `occ`, `g1`, `g2`, `i_prev`, and `occ` with its specific conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing the previously stored value of `i` plus the current value of `i`, `g1` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.**
