`occ[x]` is incremented by 1. The value of `occ[x]` was previously 0, so now it becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` has lost one element, `occ[x]` is 1, `g0` is unchanged, `g1` is unchanged, `g2` is unchanged, `output` is unchanged, `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times, otherwise `v` is updated based on the condition inside the loop.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` has lost one element, `occ[x]` is 1, `g0` is unchanged, `g1` is unchanged, `g2` is unchanged, `output` is unchanged, `v` is `n + 1` if the loop did not execute any times, otherwise `v` is updated based on the condition inside the loop.**
