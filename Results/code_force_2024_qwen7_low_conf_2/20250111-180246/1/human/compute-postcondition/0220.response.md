Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - \( n \) is at least 1.
   - \( i \) is 1.
   - \( a \) is a list of integers.
   - \( occ \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in \( a \) that lies in the range from 0 to \( n \).
   - \( t \) is greater than \( n + 2 \).
   - \( k \) is twice the input integer \( n \).
   - \( g0 \) is an empty list.
   - \( g1 \) is either [1] or an empty list.
   - \( g2 \) is either an empty list or [1].
   - \( occ[i] \) is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise \( occ[i] \) is 1 if it was 1 in the if part, otherwise \( occ[i] \) remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, \( i \) is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, \( i \) needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, \( i \) will be 2.
   - Since the loop depends on \( i \) being within the range of 1 to \( n \), \( n \) must remain at least 1.

Given these points, we can summarize the new states:

- \( n \) remains at least 1.
- \( i \) is now 2.
- \( a \) remains as a list of integers.
- \( occ \) remains a list of length \( n + 1 \) with counts updated based on the loop body (but we don't know the exact updates without seeing the loop body).
- \( t \) remains greater than \( n + 2 \).
- \( k \) remains twice the input integer \( n \).
- \( g0 \) remains an empty list.
- \( g1 \) remains either [1] or an empty list.
- \( g2 \) remains either an empty list or [1].
- \( occ[i] \) is adjusted according to the loop body logic.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is either [1] or an empty list, `g2` is either an empty list or [1], and `occ[2]` is adjusted based on the loop body logic.**
