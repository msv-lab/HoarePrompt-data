Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`. For each iteration, based on the condition inside the loop, `i` is appended to either `g0`, `g1`, or `g2`.
- After the loop completes all iterations (i.e., when `i` becomes `n + 1`), `g0` contains all the indices `i` for which `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` contains all the indices `i` for which `occ[i] == 1`, and `g2` contains all the indices `i` for which `occ[i] != 1`.
- Since the loop increments `i` until `i` reaches `n + 1`, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

Thus, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is as described above.
