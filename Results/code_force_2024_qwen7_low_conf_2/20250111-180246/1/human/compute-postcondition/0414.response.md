`res1` appends `ai` to itself, which means `res1` now contains `ai` twice. The values of other variables (`cnts`, `hp`, `wp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least four items; `hp` is `cnts[ai]` + 1; `wp` equals `wp`; `res1` is a list with `ai` appended to it twice.**
