The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop but does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Since no changes are made to any variables, the values remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles + 1`, `wp` is equal to `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) >> 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the difference `(k - (wanted_singles + 1))` remains odd, and `wanted_pairs` is `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) >> 1`.**
