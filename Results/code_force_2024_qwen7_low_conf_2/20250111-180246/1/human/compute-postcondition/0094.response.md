The code appends the string representation of `x` (which is the next element in `g1`) to the `output` list. Given that `g1` is a non-empty list with one less element, `x` is the first element of `g1`. The other variables are not affected.

Let's assume `g1` is `[1, 2, 3]` for the sake of this example. After the code runs, `x` will be `1`, and it will be appended to the `output` list. So, the `output` list will now contain `['x']`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0, `g0` is a list that may contain an element if `v < k`, `g1` is a non-empty list with one less element, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 0`, `output` is a list containing the string `'x 1'`, `x` is the next element in `g1`.
