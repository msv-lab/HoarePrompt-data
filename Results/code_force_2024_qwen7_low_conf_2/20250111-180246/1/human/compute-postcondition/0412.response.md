`hp` is incremented by 1. The value of `wp` remains unchanged, and no conditions are met to affect `cnts`. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least four items; the value of `hp` is `cnts`[ai] + 1; `wp` equals `wp`.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least four items; the value of `hp` is `cnts[ai]` + 1; `wp` equals `wp`**
