The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `g2`. Since `g2` was initially an empty list, after appending `i`, `g2` will contain `[2]`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `n` is at least 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
- `t` is greater than `n + 2`.
- `k` is twice the input integer `n`.
- `g0` is an empty list.
- `g1` is either [1] or an empty list.
- `g2` is now `[2]` after the append operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1; `i` is 2; `a` is a list of integers; `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`; `t` is greater than `n + 2`; `k` is twice the input integer `n`; `g0` is an empty list; `g1` is either [1] or an empty list; `g2` is `[2]`.**
