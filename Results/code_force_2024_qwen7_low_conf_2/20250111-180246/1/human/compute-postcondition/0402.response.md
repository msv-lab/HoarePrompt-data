Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `cnts` is a non-empty dictionary.
   - `hp` equals `wp + 1`.
   - `wp` equals `hp`.
   - `cnt` equals 2.
   - `res1` contains `ai` twice.

2. **For Loop Structure**:
   ```python
   for (ai, cnt) in cnts.items():
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - The loop iterates over the items in the dictionary `cnts`.
   - Each item in the dictionary is a tuple `(ai, cnt)` where `ai` is the key and `cnt` is the value.
   - For the loop to execute again, there must be another item in the dictionary `cnts`.

4. **Current State**:
   - Since `cnt` equals 2, it means we have already processed two items from the dictionary `cnts`.
   - To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if there are more items in the dictionary.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - After processing two items, the dictionary `cnts` must have at least three items for the loop to execute again.
   - `ai` and `cnt` will be updated to the next key-value pair in the dictionary.
   - `cnts` should now contain at least one additional item.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `cnts` must be a non-empty dictionary with at least three items.
   - `ai` will be the key of the third item in the dictionary.
   - `cnt` will be the value of the third item in the dictionary.

Therefore, the updated states for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least three items, `ai` is the key of the third item in the dictionary, `cnt` is the value of the third item in the dictionary.**
