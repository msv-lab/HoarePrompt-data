The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a string containing `x` twice to the list `output`. However, the variable `x` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no prior assignment or calculation involving `x` provided. Thus, `x` remains undefined, and the append operation does not modify the existing state of `output`.

Since `x` is not defined, the exact content of the `output` list cannot be specified. However, we know that the length of `output` increases by 1 because an element is appended to it.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0, `g0` is a non-empty list (one less element than before), `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list with one additional element, and `x` is undefined.**
