To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `g0` is not empty.
  - There exists at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`.
  - If `v < k`, then `v` is set to `k + 4` and `output` contains a string 'x x'.
  - Otherwise, the state of `v` remains unchanged or is not less than `k + 2`.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for x in g0:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g0`. Therefore, as long as `g0` is not empty, the loop will continue to execute.

2. **Effect of the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that it involves some operations based on the conditions provided.
   - Specifically, if `v < k`, then `v` is set to `k + 4` and `output` contains a string 'x x'. Otherwise, `v` remains unchanged or is not less than `k + 2`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed:**
   - `g0` is not empty, so the loop can still execute.
   - For the loop to execute again, `g0` should still contain at least one element.
   - The presence of `i` such that `occ[i] == 0` does not directly affect the loop condition but could impact the internal logic within the loop.
   - Since the loop body is not specified, we focus on the general state that must remain true for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
Since `g0` is not empty, and the loop body will continue to check and possibly modify the values of `v` and `output`, the only explicit state that needs to be maintained for the loop to execute again is the non-emptiness of `g0`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`g0` is not empty**
