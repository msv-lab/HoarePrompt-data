`res1` is a list that appends `ai` to itself. Since the value of `ai` is not specified, let's denote it as `ai`. The previous value of `res1` was a list containing elements that meet the condition `cnts[ai] == 1`. After appending `ai` to `res1`, the new value of `res1` will be the previous elements plus `ai`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai`, `res2` is a list containing `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `hs` is `1` (if `cnts[ai] == 1`) or increased by 1, and the loop continues if `hs < ws`.
