To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- The loop variable is `x`.
- The loop iterates over `g1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `v` is incremented by 1.
  - `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` if and only if `v < k`.
  - Otherwise, the state of `v` and `output` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `v < k`.

2. **State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `v` is incremented by 1.
   - If `v < k`:
     - `output` contains the string `f'{x}'`.
   - Otherwise:
     - `v` and `output` remain unchanged.

3. **Determining the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `v` must still be less than `k`.
   - Therefore, `v` must be incremented (which means it was previously less than `k`).

4. **Updating States:**
   - `v` will be incremented again (so if `v` was `v-1` before, now it will be `v-1 + 1 = v`).
   - If `v < k` still holds true, then `output` will contain the string `f'{x}'` again.
   - If `v >= k`, then `output` and `v` will remain unchanged.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `v < k` must hold true. Therefore, `v` will be incremented by 1, and `output` will be updated to contain the string `f'{x}'` if `v < k` still holds.

**Final State:**
- `v` is incremented by 1.
- If `v < k` still holds, then `output` contains the string `f'{x}'`.
- If `v >= k`, then `output` and `v` remain unchanged.

State: **`v` is incremented by 1 and output is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` if and only if `v < k`; otherwise, `v` and `output` remain unchanged.**
