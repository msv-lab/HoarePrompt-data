Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `False`, `ws` is `0`, `wp` is `0`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0. If `wanted_singles` is greater than `singles`, then the values of `singles`, `pairs`, `found`, `ws`, and `wp` remain unchanged.***
