Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0, `g0` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] > 1`, `v` is the final value of `v` after all iterations, `output` is a list of string representations of integers and pairs of integers as described in the loop logic, `i` is the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it processes the inputs `n` and `k`, constructs the list `a`, and updates the `occ` list.
- After processing all inputs, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` will contain all the relevant indices based on their occurrence counts in `a`.
- The `output` list will contain the required string representations based on the conditions in the loop, and `v` will be updated accordingly.
- Since the loop runs `t` times and processes each input independently, the final state of the variables will be determined by the last iteration's state, given that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.
