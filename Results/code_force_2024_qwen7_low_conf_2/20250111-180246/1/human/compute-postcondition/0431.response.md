The code snippet `res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. This means that `res2` will now contain all elements previously in `res2` plus the new element `ai`.

- `cnts2` remains unchanged as the code does not affect this dictionary.
- `hp` remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `wp` remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `res1` remains unchanged as the code does not affect this list.
- `hs` remains unchanged as the code does not affect this variable.
- `res2` is updated by appending `ai` to it.

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (excluding the current key-value pair `(ai, cnt)`), `hp` is 2, `wp` is equal to 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it.**
