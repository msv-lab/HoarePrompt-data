Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `k` is twice the integer from the input (`k = 2 * n`).
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
   - `g0` is a list containing the value of `i` if `occ[i] == 0`.
   - `g1` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1`.
   - `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - For all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the next iteration starts.

Given the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `n`.
- After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `i_prev` such that `1 <= i_prev < n`.
- For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

Since the loop condition does not depend on `t`, `k`, `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, and these values remain unchanged during the loop execution, we only need to update the value of `i`.

### Updated States:
- `t` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
- `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
- `k` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
- `a` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
- `occ` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
- `g0`, `g1`, `g2` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop variable `i`.

Thus, the state just before the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing the value of `i` if `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.**

In summary, the key change is in the value of `i`:

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing the value of `i` if `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.**
