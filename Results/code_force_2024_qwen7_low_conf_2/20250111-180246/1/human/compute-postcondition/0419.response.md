Postcondition: ***`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 0, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`. The current value of `hp` is 0 and the current value of `wp` is 0 since the if condition `hp == wp` is true.***
