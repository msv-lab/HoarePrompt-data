Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1` and `g1` must not be empty, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is equal to `2 * len(g2)` if `len(g2) > 0` and `v` is `0` otherwise, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list, and the condition `v < k` is satisfied**.
