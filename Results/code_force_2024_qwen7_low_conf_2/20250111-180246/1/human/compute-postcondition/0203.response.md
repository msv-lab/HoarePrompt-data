`occ` is being updated by incrementing the count of the value `x` by 1. However, the exact value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, and there is no initial value given for `occ`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `occ[x]` after the operation. The only thing we know is that the count of `x` in the `occ` dictionary has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
