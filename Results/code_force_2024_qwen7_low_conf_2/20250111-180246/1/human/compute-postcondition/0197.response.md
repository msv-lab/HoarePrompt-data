Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is specified by `range(t)`, which means the loop will run `t` times. The variable `i` is mentioned as being equal to the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`).

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `g1` is a list of elements whose occurrences in `a` are greater than 1.
   - `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` for each element `x` in `g1` such that `v < k` holds, where `v` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `g1`.
   - `i` is the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`).
   - The program prints the content of `output`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - The initial value of `i` is `n + 1`, so after the first iteration, `i` becomes `n + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to `t`.

Given this, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is incremented and the loop continues as long as it is less than `t`.

**Adjusted State**:
- `g1` remains unchanged since the loop body does not modify `g1`.
- `output` remains unchanged since the loop body does not modify `output`.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if initially `i` was `n + 1`, after the first iteration, `i` becomes `n + 2`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i <= t`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`g1` is a list of elements whose occurrences in `a` are greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` for each element `x` in `g1` such that `v < k` holds, where `v` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `g1`, `i` is `n + 2`, and the program prints the content of `output`.**

However, since `i` is the length of `occ` and `occ` is not modified within the loop, we can simplify the state to focus on `i` and `t`:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`**
