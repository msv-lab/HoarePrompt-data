Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a` and all other elements are 0.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: We start with `t` being a positive integer within the specified range, `n` being an integer from the input, `k` being twice `n`, `a` being a non-empty list of integers from the input, and `occ` being a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a` and increments the corresponding index in the list `occ` by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `a`.
- **Final State**: After the loop completes, the `occ` list will contain the count of each integer from the list `a`. Specifically, the element at index `x` in `occ` will be the number of times `x` appears in `a`.

Thus, the final state of the program after the loop completes is as described above.
