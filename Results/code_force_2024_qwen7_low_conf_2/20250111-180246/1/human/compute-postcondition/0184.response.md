The code snippet appends a formatted string containing the value of `x` to the list `output`. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Since the initial state does not provide a specific value for `x`, we cannot determine its exact value after the code is executed. We know that `output` is a list, and now it will contain one additional element, which is a string formatted to include the value of `x`.

Given the lack of a specific value for `x`, the output state can be described as follows:

- `g1` contains at least one element (unchanged).
- The value of `v` is less than `k` (unchanged).
- `output` is a list that now includes one more element, which is a string formatted to include the value of `x`.

Output State: **`g1` contains at least one element; the value of `v` is less than `k`; `output` is a list including an additional element which is a string formatted to include the value of `x`.**
