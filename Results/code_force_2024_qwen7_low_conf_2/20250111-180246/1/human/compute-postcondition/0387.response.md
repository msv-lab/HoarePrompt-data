The variable `hs` is incremented by 1. The initial state is that `hs` is either `1` (if `cnts[ai] == 1`) or a value less than `ws` (since the loop continues if `hs < ws`). After incrementing `hs` by 1, the new value of `hs` is the original value of `hs` plus 1.

Since `hs` was initially `1` (if `cnts[ai] == 1`), it now becomes `2`. If `hs` was already less than `ws`, it is now one more than its previous value, which is still less than `ws` unless the previous value was `ws-1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `res2` is a list containing the previous elements plus `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `hs` is `hs + 1`**.
