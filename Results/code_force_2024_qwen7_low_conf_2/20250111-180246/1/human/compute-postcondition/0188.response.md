The code `output.append(f'{x}')` appends a formatted string of `x` to the list `output`. However, the initial value of `x` is not specified in the given initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `x` is appended as a formatted string to the list `output`.

Output State: **`output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'`**
