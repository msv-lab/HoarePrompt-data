`v` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `v` is not specified in the initial state. The values of `g0`, `output`, and `g1` remain unchanged as there is no code that affects them.

Output State: **`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' plus an additional entry 'x', and `g1` must contain at least one element; `v` is increased by 1**
