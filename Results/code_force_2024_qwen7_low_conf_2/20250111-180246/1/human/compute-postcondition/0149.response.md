Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element (with elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1), `output` contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` four times, `v` is 6, `i` is the index of the next unprocessed element in `occ`, and `x` is the next element in `g2` that hasn't been processed yet.***

Explanation: Since the else part is empty, the postcondition of the if statement directly becomes the overall postcondition of the if-else block. The if condition ensures that `v` becomes 6, leading to the specified output and `v` value.
