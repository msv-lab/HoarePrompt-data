The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. This changes the value of `res2` but does not affect the values of `cnts2`, `hp`, `wp`, `res1`, `hs`, or `ai`. 

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 3, `wp` is 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it**
