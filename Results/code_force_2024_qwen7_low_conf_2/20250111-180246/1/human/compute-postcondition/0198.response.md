The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means the previous value of `i` (which is `n + 2`) and the condition that `t` must be greater than `n + 2` remain unchanged. However, `i` is no longer updated because it is recalculated based on the new value of `n`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `n` and `k`, along with the unchanged values of `i` and the condition on `t`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, t must be greater than `n + 2`**
