The provided Python code initializes an empty list named `output`. No changes are made to any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the state of all variables remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is 0, `output` is an empty list.**
