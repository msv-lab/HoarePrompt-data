Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k` and `v` is `2 \times |g2|`, `v` is `2 \times |g2|` if all elements in `g2` were processed, otherwise `v` is less than `k` and `output` contains those processed pairs.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: This is the input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- **`n`**: This is an integer from the input.
- **`k`**: This is twice the integer from the input, i.e., \(k = 2 \times n\).
- **`a`**: This is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- **`occ`**: This is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
- **`g0`**: This is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
- **`g1`**: This is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
- **`g2`**: This is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`.
- **`i`**: This is `n + 1`.
- **`v`**: This starts at 0 and increments by 2 each time an element from `g2` is processed until `v` reaches or exceeds `k`.
- **`output`**: This is a list that will contain all the pairs `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` as long as `v < k`.

### Loop Execution Analysis:
- The loop iterates over elements in `g2` and appends `f'{x} {x}'` to `output` while `v < k`.
- Each iteration increments `v` by 2.
- Once `v` reaches `k`, the loop stops, and no further elements from `g2` are added to `output`.

Thus, the final state of the variables is as described above.
