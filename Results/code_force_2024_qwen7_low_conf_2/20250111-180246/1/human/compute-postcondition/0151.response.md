Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total` is 0
   - `t` is unchanged (we don't need to adjust this as it's not used in the loop)
   - `a` is an empty list
   - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros
   - `g0` contains elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0
   - `g1` contains elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1
   - `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1
   - `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'` repeated `v/2` times, where `v` is `2 * len(g2)` if the loop executed, otherwise `0`
   - `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over elements in `g1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `g1` must contain at least one element.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `g1` is not empty. If `g1` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `total` remains 0.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros.
   - `g0` contains elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0.
   - `g1` contains at least one element (to ensure the loop executes).
   - `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1.
   - `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'` repeated `v/2` times, where `v` is `2 * len(g2)` if the loop executed, otherwise `0`.
   - `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.

Based on this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute.

**State:**
- **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` must contain at least one element, `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'` repeated `v/2` times, where `v` is `2 * len(g2)` if the loop executed, otherwise `0`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**
