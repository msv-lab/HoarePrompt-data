`i` is appended to `g1`. The value of `i` is `current_i + 1`, so `g1` will have its last value as `current_i + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are both empty lists, `output` is an empty list, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is `current_i + 1` and `g1` is `[current_i + 1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are both empty lists, `output` is an empty list, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is `current_i + 1`, `g1` is `[current_i + 1]`.**
