Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element (with elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1), `output` contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` twice, `v` is 4 if it was initially 2 or greater than `k` if it was initially less than 2, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list, and `x` is the first element in `g2` that hasn't been processed yet.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we only consider the if part. According to the if part's postcondition, all the variables remain unchanged as specified, and the value of `v` is adjusted based on its initial value relative to `k`. Therefore, the overall postcondition retains the same state as described in the if part's postcondition.
