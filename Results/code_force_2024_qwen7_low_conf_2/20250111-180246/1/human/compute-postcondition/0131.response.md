`g2.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `g2`. Since `i` is equal to `current_i + 1`, `g2` will now contain this new value.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are both empty lists, `output` is an empty list, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is `current_i + 1`, `g2` is `[current_i + 1]`**
