Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `occ[x]` is incremented by 1, meaning `occ[x]` now holds the count of how many times `x` appears in the list `a`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for x in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - Each time the loop runs, `x` is taken from the list `a`, and `occ[x]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine what changes occur when moving from one iteration to the next.
   - Since `x` is taken from the list `a` in each iteration, the list `a` gets shorter with each iteration.
   - Therefore, the next value of `x` to be processed will be the next element in the list `a`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - The list `a` loses one element (the current `x`) as it progresses through the loop.
   - The variable `occ` remains unchanged between iterations unless the same `x` value reappears, but we only need to consider the general state for the next iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- The list `a` loses one element, so it becomes a non-empty list of integers minus one element.
- The variable `occ[x]` remains unchanged as no new increment occurs for `occ` during the transition to the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers minus one element, `occ[x]` is incremented by 1**
