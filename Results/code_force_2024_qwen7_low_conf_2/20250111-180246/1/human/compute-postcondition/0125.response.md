The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. From the initial state, we know that `i` is an index such that `occ[i + 1] == 0`, and `g2` is initially an empty list. After executing this line of code, `g2` will contain the value of `i`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is an index such that `occ[i + 1] == 0`, `g2` contains the value `i`.**
