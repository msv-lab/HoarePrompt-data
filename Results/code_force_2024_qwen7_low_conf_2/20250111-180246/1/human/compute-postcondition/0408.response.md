Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary with at least three items, where `ai` is the key of the third item in the dictionary, and `cnt` is the value of the third item in the dictionary. If `cnt == 2`, then `hp` is increased by 1 and `res1` contains the key `ai` and an additional element `ai`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
