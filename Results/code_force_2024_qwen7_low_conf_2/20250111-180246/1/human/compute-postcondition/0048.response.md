To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the conditions for the loop to continue.

### Given Information:
- `total` is 0
- `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `k` is twice the integer from the input, so \(k = 2 \times n\)
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index \(x\) (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0
- `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`
- `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`
- `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 2`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- If `v < k`, then `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'` and `v` is `v + 2`. Otherwise, `output` remains unchanged and `v` remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `x` in `g2`.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `g2` must contain at least one element. This means that there must be at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 2`.
- The value of `i` does not change within the loop; it is fixed at `n + 1`.

### States to Adjust:
- `total` remains 0.
- `t` remains as an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` remains the same integer from the input.
- `k` remains \(2 \times n\).
- `a` remains the same non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` remains the same list where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
- `g0` remains the list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
- `g1` remains the list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
- `g2` must now contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `i` remains `n + 1`.
- `v` remains unchanged because the condition `v < k` does not specify how `v` changes in this context, only the output and `v` itself if the condition is met.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n + 1`.**
