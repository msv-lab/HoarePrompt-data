`v` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `v` is less than `k`, so after incrementing `v` by 1, `v` is still less than `k`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`g1` contains at least one element; the value of `v` is less than `k` + 1; `output` is a list including an additional element which is a string formatted to include the value of `x`.**
