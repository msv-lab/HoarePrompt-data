The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1. Therefore, `g2` will now contain the value 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is [1], `occ[i]` is not equal to 1**
