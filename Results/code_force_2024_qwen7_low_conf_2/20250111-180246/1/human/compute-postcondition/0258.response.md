To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can continue:

1. The loop iterates over elements in `g1`, which contains all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`.
2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that there must be at least one more element in `g1`.

Let's break down the relevant states and their modifications:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
- `t` is greater than `n + 2`.
- `k` is twice the input integer `n`.
- `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`.
- `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1` and must have at least two elements.
- `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.
- `v` is 1.
- `output` is an empty list since `v < k`.

Given that `v` is 1 and `k` is `2n`, `output` will be empty, and it won't contain any strings unless `v < k` changes.

At the end of the previous iteration, `g1` had at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still have at least one element left.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `g1`, which must now have at least one element.

**Adjusted States:**
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `occ` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `k` remains unchanged.
- `g0` remains unchanged.
- `g1` must have at least one element.
- `g2` remains unchanged.
- `v` remains 1.
- `output` remains an empty list.
