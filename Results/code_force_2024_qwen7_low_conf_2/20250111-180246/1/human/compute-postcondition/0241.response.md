In the given code snippet, the loop body is now included, and it appends a formatted string to the `output` list for each element in `g2`. Let's analyze the step-by-step impact of this code:

1. **Initial State**:
   - \( n \) is a non-negative integer.
   - \( a \) is a list of integers.
   - \( occ \) is a list of length \( n + 1 \) where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in \( a \) that lies in the range from 0 to \( n \).
   - \( t \) is greater than \( n + 2 \).
   - \( k \) is twice the input integer \( n \).
   - \( g0 \) is a list containing all integers \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive) where \( occ[i] == 0 \).
   - \( g1 \) is a list containing all integers \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive) where \( occ[i] == 1 \).
   - \( g2 \) is a list containing at least one integer \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive) where \( occ[i] \geq 2 \).
   - \( v \) is incremented by 2.
   - \( output \) is an empty list if \( v < k \).

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element \( x \) in the list \( g2 \).
   - For each \( x \), the line `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a string to the `output` list in the form of `f'{x} {x}'`, which is equivalent to appending `str(x) + ' ' + str(x)` to the list.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - \( output \) is updated by appending the string `f'{x} {x}'` for each \( x \) in \( g2 \).
   - All other variables remain unchanged.

4. **Updated State**:
   - \( output \) now contains the appended strings for each \( x \) in \( g2 \).

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is incremented by 2, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each \( x \) in \( g2 \).**
