Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is either [1] or an empty list, `g2` is either an empty list or [1], and `occ[i]` is 0 if the if condition is met, otherwise `occ[i]` is 1 if `occ[i]` was 1 in the if part, otherwise `occ[i]` remains unchanged.***
