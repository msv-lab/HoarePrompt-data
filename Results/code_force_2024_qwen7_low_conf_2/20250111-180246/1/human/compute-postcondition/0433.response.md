Postcondition: ***`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (excluding the current key-value pair `(ai, cnt)`), `hp` is 2, `wp` is equal to 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, and `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it, if `cnt == 2`. Otherwise, `cnts2`, `hp`, `wp`, `res1`, `hs`, and `res2` remain unchanged.***
