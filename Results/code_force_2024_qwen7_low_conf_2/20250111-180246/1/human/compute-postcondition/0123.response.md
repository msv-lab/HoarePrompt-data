`g0` is appended with the value of `i`. Since `occ[i + 1] == 0`, `g0` now contains the value of `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the value of `i + 1`, `g1` and `g2` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is an index such that `occ[i + 1] == 0`.**
