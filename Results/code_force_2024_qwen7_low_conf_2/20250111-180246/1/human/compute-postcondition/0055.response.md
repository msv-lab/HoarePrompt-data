The code snippet `output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string representation of `x` (where `x` is an element from `g2`) to the `output` list. Given the initial state, the `output` list is initially empty, and `x` is an element from `g2`.

The output state will include the updated `output` list with the appended string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k` and `v` is \(2 \times |g2|\) if all elements in `g2` were processed, otherwise `v` is less than `k` and `output` contains those processed pairs, and the value of `v` is less than `k`, `output` is appended with `f'{x}'`.**
