According to the given for loop statement and the current state at the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine how the states will change for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `g0`.
2. **Initial State**:
   - `total` is 0.
   - `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `k` is \(2 \times n\).
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input.
   - `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0.
   - `g0` is a non-empty list.
   - `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
   - `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`.
   - `i` is \(n + 1\).
   - `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'` if `v < 2 \times n`; otherwise, `output` remains unchanged.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - The loop is currently iterating over the first element of `g0`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - After the current iteration, `x` will be set to the next element in the list `g0`.
   - Since `g0` is a non-empty list, there will always be at least one more element left to iterate over.

### Adjusted States:
- `total` remains 0.
- `t` remains the same (an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)).
- `n` remains the same (an integer from the input).
- `k` remains \(2 \times n\).
- `a` remains the same (a non-empty list of integers from the input).
- `occ` remains the same (a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0).
- `g0` will now contain the remaining elements after the current element `x` is removed.
- `g1` remains the same (a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`).
- `g2` remains the same (a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`).
- `i` remains \(n + 1\).
- `output` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it based on the value of `v`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0, `g0` is a non-empty list (excluding the current element `x`), `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'` if `v < 2 \times n`; otherwise, `output` remains unchanged.**
