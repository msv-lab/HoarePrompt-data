To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze the conditions for the loop to continue.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 0
- `t` is unchanged
- `a` is an empty list
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros
- `g0` and `g1` are both empty lists
- `output` is an empty list
- `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body
- If `occ[i + 1]` equals 0, `g0` contains the value of `i + 1`.
- If `occ[i + 1]` equals 1, `g1` contains the value `i + 1`.
- Otherwise, `g2` contains the value `i + 1`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
2. **State Transition**: At the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop needs to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States:
- Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 at each iteration, the condition for the loop to continue is `i < n + 1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the current value of `i` (let's call it `current_i`).
- For the loop to execute one more time, `current_i` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state and the loop condition, we need to update the state such that the loop can continue:

### Updated States:
- `total` remains 0.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains an empty list.
- `occ` remains a list of \(n + 1\) zeros.
- `g0` and `g1` remain empty lists.
- `output` remains an empty list.
- `v` remains \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, but since the loop hasn't run yet, it remains as \(n + 1\).

Since the only state that changes with each iteration is `i`, and `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the loop to continue, we adjust `i` to `current_i + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are both empty lists, `output` is an empty list, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is `current_i + 1`.**

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `current_i`, then `i` at the start of the next iteration should be `current_i + 1`.

For clarity:
State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` and `g1` are both empty lists, `output` is an empty list, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is `current_i + 1`.**
