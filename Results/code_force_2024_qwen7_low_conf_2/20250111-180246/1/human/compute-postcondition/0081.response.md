The code `v += 2` increments the value of `v` by 2. Since `v` was not defined in the initial state, it is implied that `v` is being initialized to 0 before this operation. After the operation, `v` will be 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0, `g0` is a non-empty list (one less element than before), `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list with one additional element, and `v` is 2.**
