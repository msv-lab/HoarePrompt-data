`singles` is assigned the value `singles + 1`. Since the initial state of `singles` is not explicitly given, we assume it is an integer. The initial value of `cnt` is 1, which is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `singles` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`cnt` is 1; `singles` is an integer that is 1 more than its initial value**
