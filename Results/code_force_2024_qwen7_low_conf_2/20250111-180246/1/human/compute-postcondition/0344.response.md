Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `True`, `ws` is equal to `wanted_singles + 1`, `wp` is equal to `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) >> 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the difference `(k - (wanted_singles + 1))` remains odd, and `wanted_pairs` is `(k - (wanted_singles + 1)) >> 1`. If `wanted_singles > singles`, the program does not change these values. Since the `continue` statement is used within the if part and no changes occur, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
