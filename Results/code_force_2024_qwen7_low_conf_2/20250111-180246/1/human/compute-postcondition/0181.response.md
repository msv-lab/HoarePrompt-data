Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is a list containing all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` repeated for each element in `g0` until all elements in `g0` have been processed, `v` is `k`, `i` is the length of `occ` (which is \(n + 1\)).**

Explanation:
- Initially, `g0` contains elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0. After processing all such elements, `g0` becomes empty.
- Since `g0` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, and the loop appends the string `f'{x} {x}'` to `output` and increments `v` by 2 each time it runs, eventually `g0` will be exhausted.
- Once `g0` is empty, the loop condition fails, and the loop stops executing.
- At this point, `output` will contain the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each element that was in `g0`.
- `v` will be incremented by 2 for each iteration, so it will eventually reach `k` and the loop will stop.
- `i` will be the last index processed in `occ`, which is the length of `occ`, i.e., \(n + 1\).
- `g1` and `g2` remain unchanged because no elements were added to them during the loop iterations.
