Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is `False`, `ws` is `0`, `wp` is `0`, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the difference `(k - wanted_singles)` remains odd, and `wanted_pairs` is `(k - wanted_singles) >> 1`. If `wanted_pairs` is greater than `pairs`, then the value of `wanted_pairs` is reduced to match the current value of `pairs`. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
