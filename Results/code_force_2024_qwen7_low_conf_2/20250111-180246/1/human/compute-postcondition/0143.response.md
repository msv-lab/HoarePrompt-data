`output` is appended with the value `f'{x} {x}'`. Since `output` was initially either an empty list or a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'`, appending `f'{x} {x}'` to it means that `output` now contains `f'{x} {x}'` twice. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element (with elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1), `output` contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` twice, `v` is either 2 or less than `k`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list, and `x` is the first element in `g2` that hasn't been processed yet.**
