`res1.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res1`. The value of `res1` initially contains `ai`, so after appending `ai` again, `res1` will contain `ai` twice. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` equals `wp + 1`, `wp` equals `hp`, `cnt` equals 2, `res1` contains `ai` twice**
