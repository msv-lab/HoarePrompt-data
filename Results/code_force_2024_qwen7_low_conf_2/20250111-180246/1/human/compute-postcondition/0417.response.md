`hp` is initially set to the number of pairs (elements with count > 1) found in `cnts`. After executing the line `hp = 0`, the value of `hp` is explicitly set to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a non-empty dictionary, `hp` is 0, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, `hp` is 0**
