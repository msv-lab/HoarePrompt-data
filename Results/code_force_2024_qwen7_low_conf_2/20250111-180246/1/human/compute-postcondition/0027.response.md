The code `g2.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `g2`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1. Since the condition `occ[i] != 1` is met (because `occ[i]` is not 1), `i` is appended to `g2`.

Therefore, the output state includes updating `g2` to include `i`, which is `i_prev + 1`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, `g0` is a list containing the value of `i` if `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is either an empty list or a list containing the index `i` where `occ[i] != 1` with `i` now being `i_prev + 1`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and for all indices `i` in `occ`, `occ[i]` is either 0, 1, or more than 1.**
