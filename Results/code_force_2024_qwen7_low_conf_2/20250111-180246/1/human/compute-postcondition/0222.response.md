`g1` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is either [1] or an empty list plus 2, `g2` is either an empty list or [1], and `occ[2]` is adjusted based on the loop body logic.**
