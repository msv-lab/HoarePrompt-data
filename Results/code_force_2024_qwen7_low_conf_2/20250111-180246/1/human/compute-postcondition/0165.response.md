The code `print(' '.join(output))` does not modify any variables; it only prints the contents of the `output` list. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string representations of the first `k` elements from `g1` if `len(g1) >= k`, otherwise it remains `[f'{x} {x}']`, `v` is `k` if the loop executed, otherwise `0`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**
