The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string consisting of `x` repeated twice to the `output` list. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Since no value is provided for `x`, it remains undefined. The only affected variable is `output`, which is initially an empty list and now contains the string `f'{x} {x}'`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element, `g2` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'`, `v` is 0, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list, and the value of `v` is less than `k`.**
