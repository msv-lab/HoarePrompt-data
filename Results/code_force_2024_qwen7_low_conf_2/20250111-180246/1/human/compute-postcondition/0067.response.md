The code prints the concatenated strings from the `output` list, which contains pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v = 2 * |g2|`. However, the actual values of the variables and their relationships remain unchanged except for the creation of the `output` list.

- `total` remains 0.
- `t` remains an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` remains the integer from the input.
- `k` remains \(2 \times n\).
- `a` remains a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` remains a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0.
- `g0` remains a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`.
- `g1` remains a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`.
- `g2` remains a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`.
- `i` remains \(n + 1\).
- `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v = 2 * |g2|`.

Since the code does not modify the values of `total`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, `g2`, `i`, and `output`, only the `output` list is created and printed.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v = 2 * |g2|`, the value of `v` is `2 * |g2|`.**
