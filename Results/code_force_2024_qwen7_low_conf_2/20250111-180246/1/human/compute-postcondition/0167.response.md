The code `output = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `output`. This means that `output` is now an empty list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` contains all elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is an empty list, `v` is 0, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**
