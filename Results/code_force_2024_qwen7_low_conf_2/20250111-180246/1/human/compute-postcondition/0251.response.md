The code `output.append(f'{x}')` appends the string `f'{x}'` to the list `output`. Since the condition `v < k` is satisfied and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2`, appending `f'{x}'` to `output` will not change the fact that `output` contains these strings.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `output` now contains one more instance of the string `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1` and `g1` must not be empty, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is equal to `2 * len(g2)` if `len(g2) > 0` and `v` is `0` otherwise, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2` plus one additional string `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2`.**
