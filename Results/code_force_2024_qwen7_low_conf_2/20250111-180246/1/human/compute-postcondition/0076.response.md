The code snippet appends a string in the format `'x x'` to the `output` list. Given that `x` is already defined, the value of `x` is appended twice as a string. Since `x` is not redefined within the snippet, its value remains unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `output.append(f'{x} {x}')`: This line appends the formatted string `'x x'` to the `output` list, where `x` is the last value assigned to `x`.

Since the initial state includes `x` being an integer from the input, and no new value is assigned to `x` within the given code snippet, `x` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0, `g0` is a non-empty list (excluding the current element `x`), `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'`.**
