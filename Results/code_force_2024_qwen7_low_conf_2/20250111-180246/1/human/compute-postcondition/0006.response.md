Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable and Its Initial Value:**
   - The loop variable is `x`, and it iterates over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider the Given States:**
   - `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000.
   - `n` is an integer from the input.
   - `k` is twice the integer from the input, i.e., `k = 2 * n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input.
   - `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

4. **Adjust the States for Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop depends on the list `a` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

- `t` remains as given (greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000).
- `n` remains as given (an integer from the input).
- `k` remains as given (twice the integer from the input, i.e., `k = 2 * n`).
- `a` must be a non-empty list of integers from the input.
- `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros (this does not affect the loop execution).

Putting it all together:

**State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` must be a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**.
