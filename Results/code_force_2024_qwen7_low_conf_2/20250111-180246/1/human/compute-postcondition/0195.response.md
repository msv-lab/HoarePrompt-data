Output State: **`g1` is a list of elements whose occurrences in `a` are greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` for each element `x` in `g1` such that `v < k` holds, `v` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `g1`, `i` is the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g1`, which contains elements from `a` that occur more than once.
- For each iteration, if `v < k` holds, the string `f'{x}'` is appended to `output` and `v` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues until either all elements in `g1` have been processed or `v` reaches `k`.
- After all iterations, `output` will contain the string `f'{x}'` for each element `x` in `g1` such that the condition `v < k` was satisfied during the loop.
- The value of `v` will be the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `g1` because the loop stops when `v` reaches `k` or all elements in `g1` have been processed.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is equal to the length of `occ`, which is `n + 1`.
