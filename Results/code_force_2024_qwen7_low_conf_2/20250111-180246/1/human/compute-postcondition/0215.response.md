The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `g1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is [1], `g2` is an empty list, `occ[1]` is equal to 1**
