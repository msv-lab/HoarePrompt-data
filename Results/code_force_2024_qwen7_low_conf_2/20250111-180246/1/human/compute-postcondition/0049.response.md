The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string to the `output` list. The string is composed of the value of `x` repeated twice. However, the value of `x` is not defined in the given context. Since the value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. But we know that `x` is derived from the input or list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` must contain at least one element, `i` is `n + 1`, `output` is a list with an additional string `f'{x} {x}'` appended to it.**
