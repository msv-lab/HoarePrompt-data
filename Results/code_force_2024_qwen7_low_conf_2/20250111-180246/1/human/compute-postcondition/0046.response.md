The code `v += 2` increments the value of `v` by 2. Since `v` was previously an unchanged variable, its new value is `v + 2`. All other variables remain in their original states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is twice the integer from the input, `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of `n + 1` elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` must not be empty, `i` is `n + 1`, `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'`, and `v` is `v + 2`.**
