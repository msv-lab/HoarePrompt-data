The code snippet appends the string `f'{x} {x}'` to the `output` list. Since `output` initially contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` three times, after appending another instance of `f'{x} {x}'`, it will now contain four instances of `f'{x} {x}'`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element (with elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1), `output` contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` four times, `v` is 4 if it was initially 2 or greater than `k` if it was initially less than 2, `i` is the index of the next unprocessed element in `occ`, and `x` is the next element in `g2` that hasn't been processed yet.**
