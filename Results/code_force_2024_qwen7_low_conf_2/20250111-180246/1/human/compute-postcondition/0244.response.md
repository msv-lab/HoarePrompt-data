Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the initial states:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
   - `t` is greater than `n + 2`.
   - `k` is twice the input integer `n`.
   - `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`.
   - `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`.
   - `g2` is a list containing at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.
   - `v` is incremented by 2.
   - `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list.

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `x` in `g2`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `g2` must contain at least one element. This means that there must be at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` such that `occ[i] >= 2`.
   - `v` is incremented by 2 during each iteration, but it does not affect the presence of elements in `g2`.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since the loop continues as long as `g2` is not empty, we need to ensure that `g2` still contains at least one element.
   - The other states remain unchanged because they do not directly influence the loop condition based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing at least one integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is incremented by 2, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`. Otherwise, `output` remains an empty list.**
