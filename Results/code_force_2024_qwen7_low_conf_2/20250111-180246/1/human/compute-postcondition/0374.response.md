The code appends the element `ai` to the list `res1`. Since `ai` is an element from `half2` such that `cnts[ai]` is equal to 1, this value is now added to `res1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing `ai`, `res2` is an empty list, `hs` is `1`, `ai` is an element from `half2` such that `cnts[ai]` is equal to 1, and the program has entered the if condition where `cnts[ai]` is equal to 1**
