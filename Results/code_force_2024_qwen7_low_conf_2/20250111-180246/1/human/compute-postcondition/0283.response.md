`v` is incremented by 1. The value of `v` was previously less than `k`, so after incrementing, the condition `v < k` might no longer be true. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' such that each pair consists of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the current value of `v` is less than `k`, and `g1` must contain at least one element; `v` is increased by 1.**
