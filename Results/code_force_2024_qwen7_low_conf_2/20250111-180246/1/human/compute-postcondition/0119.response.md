`g2` appends the value of `i` to itself. Since `i` is part of the condition that `occ[i]` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1, the value of `i` remains unchanged, and `g2` now contains this specific value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is `n + 1`, `g2` is `[i]`**
