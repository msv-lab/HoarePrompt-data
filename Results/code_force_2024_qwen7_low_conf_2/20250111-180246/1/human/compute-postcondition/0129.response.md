The code appends the value of `i` to the list `g0`. Given the initial state, `i` is `current_i + 1`. After appending `i` to `g0`, the list `g0` will contain this new value.

The output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` is `[current_i + 1]`, `g1` is an empty list, `output` is an empty list, `v` is \(n + 1\) or updated based on the loop body, `i` is `current_i + 1`.**
