`hp` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`wp`, `res1`, `hs`, `res2`, `cnts2`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (excluding the current key-value pair `(ai, cnt)`), `hp` is 2, `wp` is equal to `hp`, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, and `res2` is updated based on the condition `if cnt == 2: res2.append(ai * 2)`.**
