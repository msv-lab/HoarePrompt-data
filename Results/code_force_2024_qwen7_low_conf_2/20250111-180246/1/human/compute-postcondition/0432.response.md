The code `res2.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `res2`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`cnts2` is a non-empty dictionary (excluding the current key-value pair `(ai, cnt)`), `hp` is 2, `wp` is equal to 2, `res1` is a list containing all elements from `half2` that appear exactly twice in `cnts`, `hs` is equal to the length of `res1`, `res2` is updated with `ai` appended to it.**
