Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The for loop iterates over `range(1, n + 1)`, which means `i` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive.

2. **Check the initial state of `n`**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute even once.

3. **Check the initial state of `i`**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1`. Since the loop increments `i` in each iteration and `i` will be in the range from 1 to `n`, the starting value of `i` should be 1 for the loop to start.

4. **Other relevant states**:
   - The lists `a`, `occ`, `g0`, `g1`, and `g2` do not directly affect whether the loop executes. They are only used within the loop body, and their initial values are given but don't impact the loop condition.
   - The variable `t` being greater than `n + 2` and `k` being twice `n` are conditions outside the loop that do not affect the loop itself.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n`).

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is an empty list, `g1` is an empty list, `g2` is an empty list**.
