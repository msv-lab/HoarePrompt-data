The value of `v` is incremented by 2. The previous value of `v` is less than `k`, so the new value of `v` is `v + 2`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` must contain at least one element, `g1` is irrelevant, `g2` is irrelevant, `output` is a list containing the string f'{x} {x}', `v` is less than `k` and equals `v + 2`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list.**
