The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings using the space delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. 

- The value of `i` was initially set as `n + 2`, where `n` is an input integer. This value does not change.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `k` is twice the input integer `n`, so `k = 2 * n`.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than `n + 2` remains valid.

After executing the code, the list `a` will contain integers obtained from the input. However, without knowing the exact input, we cannot specify the exact values in the list. But we know the list is formed from integers split from the input.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `t` must be greater than `n + 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
