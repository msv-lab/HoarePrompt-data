`pairs` is incremented by 1. If `cnt` was 1, then `singles` is 1 more than its current value; otherwise, `pairs` is increased by 1. Since `cnt` is either 1 or not 1, the only variable that is definitively updated is `pairs`.

Output State: **`cnts` must contain at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is either 1 or not 1, `singles` is 1 more than its current value if `cnt` is 1, `pairs` is increased by 1, and `pairs` is 1 more than its previous value.**
