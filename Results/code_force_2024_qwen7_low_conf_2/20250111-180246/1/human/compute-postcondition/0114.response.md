`g0` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is such that `occ[i] == 0`, and no other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the value of `i` (where `occ[i] == 0`), `g1` and `g2` are all empty lists, `output` is empty, `v` is `n + 1` or updated based on the loop body, `i` is an index such that `occ[i] == 0`.
