Postcondition: ***`v` is an integer that is either 1 more than its initial value and still less than `k`, or remains less than `k` as initially. `k` is an integer, and `output` is a list with two elements: the string representation of `x` (where `x` is part of `g1`) and the initial string representation of `x`.***
