Postcondition: ***`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `res2` is a list containing `ai` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, `hs` is `1` if `cnts[ai] == 1`, otherwise `hs` remains unchanged, where `ai` is the next element in `half` such that `cnts[ai]` is equal to 1, and the loop breaks if `hs == ws`.***
