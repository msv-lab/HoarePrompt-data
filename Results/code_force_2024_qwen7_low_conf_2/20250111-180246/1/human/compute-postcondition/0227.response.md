`g0` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 3. The value of `i` is updated to 4 (since it is incremented implicitly by appending it to `g0`), while other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, and `occ[2]` retains its previous value.
