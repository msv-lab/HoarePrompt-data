Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `g0` is empty.
   - `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' such that each pair consists of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `g1` must contain at least one element.
   - The current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k`.
   - `v` is increased by 1 if `v` was less than `k`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in g1:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `g1` must still contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `g1`, and `g1` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `g1` still meets this requirement.
   - The other states (`g0`, `output`, and `v`) do not directly affect the condition for the loop to continue as long as `g1` has at least one element.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `g0` is empty (unchanged).
   - `output` remains the same (unchanged).
   - `g1` must still contain at least one element.
   - `v` could either be unchanged (if it was already `k`) or incremented by 1 (if it was less than `k`).

Given these points, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`g0` is empty, `output` contains pairs of integers 'x x' such that each pair consists of integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `k`, and `g1` must contain at least one element**
