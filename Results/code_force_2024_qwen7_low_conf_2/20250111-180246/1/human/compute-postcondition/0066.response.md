Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Initial State:
- `total` is 0
- `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `n` is an integer from the input
- `k` is \(2 \times n\)
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input
- `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0
- `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`
- `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`
- `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`
- `i` is \(n + 1\)
- `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v < k` and `v` is \(2 \times |g2|\) if all elements in `g2` were processed, otherwise `v` is less than `k` and `output` contains those processed pairs
- `v` is initially 0

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over each element `x` in `g1`. For each iteration, it checks if `v < k` and if so, appends `f'{x}'` to `output` and increments `v` by 1.

### Key Observations:
1. **`g1`**: Contains at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`. This means there is at least one element in `a` that occurs exactly once.
2. **`g2`**: Contains all indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`. These are elements in `a` that occur more than once or not at all.
3. **`v`**: Starts at 0 and increments by 1 for each valid append operation to `output`.

### Final State Analysis:
- After the loop completes, `v` will be equal to `2 * |g2|` because each element in `g2` is processed exactly once and `v` is incremented by 1 for each valid append.
- Since `g1` contains at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, the loop will execute at least once, appending `f'{x}'` to `output` for each `x` in `g2` until `v` reaches `2 * |g2|`.
- If `g1` contains more than one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, the loop will execute multiple times, but the total number of iterations will be limited by the condition `v < k`.

### Output State:
Given the above analysis, the final state of the variables after the loop completes will be:
- `total` remains 0
- `t` remains unchanged
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` remains unchanged
- `a` remains unchanged
- `occ` remains unchanged
- `g0` remains unchanged
- `g1` may or may not change based on the elements in `a` that occur exactly once
- `g2` remains unchanged
- `i` remains unchanged
- `output` contains all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v` is equal to `2 * |g2|`
- `v` is equal to `2 * |g2|`

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where each element at index `x` (from the list `a`) is incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `a`, all other elements are 0, `g0` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing all pairs of strings `f'{x} {x}'` for each `x` in `g2` such that `v = 2 * |g2|`, `v` is equal to `2 * |g2|`.**
