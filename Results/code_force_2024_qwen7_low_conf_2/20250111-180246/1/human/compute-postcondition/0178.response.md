The code snippet `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a new string to the `output` list. Since the initial state of `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'` and `f'{x} {x}'`, appending another string `f'{x} {x}'` to it will result in a list with three identical strings.

The states of the other variables (`total`, `t`, `a`, `occ`, `g1`, `g2`, `v`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g1` is irrelevant, `g2` is irrelevant, `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x} {x}'`, `f'{x} {x}'`, and `f'{x} {x}'`, `v` is less than `k` and equals `v + 4`, `i` is `i + 1` (the next index in the `occ` list).**
