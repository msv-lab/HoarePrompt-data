`v` is incremented by 2. The initial value of `v` can be either 2 or less than `k`. Since `v` is incremented by 2, it becomes 4 if it was initially 2, or it becomes greater than `k` if it was initially less than `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element (with elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1), `output` contains the string `f'{x} {x}'` twice, `v` is 4 if it was initially 2 or greater than `k` if it was initially less than 2, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list, and `x` is the first element in `g2` that hasn't been processed yet.**
