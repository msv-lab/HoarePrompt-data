Output State: **`cnts` is a dictionary containing the counts of elements in `half2`, `singles` is the total number of elements with a count of 1 in `cnts2`, `pairs` is the total number of elements with a count greater than 1 in `cnts2`, `found` is either `True` or `False`, `ws` is either the value of `wanted_singles` when the loop breaks or `0`, `wp` is either the corresponding value of `wanted_pairs` when the loop breaks or `0`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `res1` is a list containing all elements `ai` from `half2` such that `cnts[ai] == 1`, `res2` is a list containing all elements `ai` from `half2` such that `cnts[ai] == 1`, `hs` is equal to the number of elements in `res1` (which is also the number of elements in `res2`).** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `ai` in `half2`.
- For each iteration, if `hs` equals `ws`, the loop breaks.
- If `cnts[ai] == 1`, the element `ai` is appended to both `res1` and `res2`, and `hs` is incremented by 1.
- The loop continues until `hs` equals `ws`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `ws` is `0`), the values of `res1` and `res2` remain as empty lists, and `hs` remains `0`.
