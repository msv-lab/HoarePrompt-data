`v` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 0, `g1` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is 1, `g2` must contain at least one element, `g2` contains the elements whose occurrence in `a` is greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x} {x}'`, `v` is 2, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list, and the value of `v` is less than `k`.**
