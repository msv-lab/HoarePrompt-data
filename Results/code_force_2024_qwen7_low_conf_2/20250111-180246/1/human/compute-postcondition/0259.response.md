The code snippet `output.append(f'{x}')` appends a formatted string representation of the variable `x` to the list `output`. However, since no specific value for `x` is given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact content of `output` after this operation. The only thing we can infer is that `output` is now a list containing one element which is the string representation of `x`.

Output State: **`output` is a list containing one element, the string representation of `x`.**
