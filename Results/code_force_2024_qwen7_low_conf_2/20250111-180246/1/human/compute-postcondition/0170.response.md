The code `output.append(f'{x} {x}')` appends a formatted string containing `x` twice to the `output` list. However, the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. Since the exact value of `x` is not given, we cannot determine the exact string that will be appended. But we know that the `output` list will gain a new entry.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is unchanged, `a` is an empty list, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) zeros, `g0` must contain at least one element, `g1` is irrelevant, `g2` is irrelevant, `output` is a list containing the string f'{x} {x}', `v` is less than `k`, `i` is the last processed index in the `occ` list**
