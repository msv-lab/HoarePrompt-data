To determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop, let's analyze the loop and the conditions under which it executes.

### Loop Analysis:
- **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `g1`, which contains all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`.
- **Update Condition**: The loop appends `f'{x}'` to `output` and increments `v` by 1 each time it executes, but only if `v < k`.

### Key Points:
- `g1` contains integers `i` where `occ[i] == 1`.
- `v` starts as 1 and is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs.
- `output` is modified based on the value of `v` relative to `k`.

### Final Iteration Analysis:
- **Case 1**: If `v < k` after the loop finishes:
  - `output` will contain `len(g2)` elements, each being `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2`.
  - `v` will be `len(g2) + 1`.
- **Case 2**: If `v >= k` after the loop finishes:
  - `output` remains an empty list.
  - `v` retains its value.

### Determining the Final State:
- **Initial Values**:
  - `n`: non-negative integer.
  - `a`: list of integers.
  - `occ`: list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`.
  - `t`: greater than `n + 2`.
  - `k`: twice the input integer `n`.
  - `g0`: list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`.
  - `g1`: list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`.
  - `g2`: list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`.
  - `v`: either `1` (if `len(g2) > 0`) or `0` (if `len(g2) == 0`).
  - `output`: initially empty list.

### Final Output State:
- **If the loop does not execute** (i.e., `g1` is empty):
  - `output` remains an empty list.
  - `v` remains `1` if `len(g2) > 0` or `0` if `len(g2) == 0`.

- **If the loop executes**:
  - `output` will contain the string representations of the elements in `g2` if `v < k`.
  - `v` will be `len(g2) + 1`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of integers, `occ` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of occurrences of each integer in `a` that lies in the range from 0 to `n`, `t` is greater than `n + 2`, `k` is twice the input integer `n`, `g0` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all integers `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where `occ[i] >= 2`, `v` is `len(g2) + 1` if `v < k` and `1` if `v >= k`, and `output` is a list containing the strings `f'{x}'` for each `x` in `g2` if `v < k`, otherwise `output` is an empty list.**
