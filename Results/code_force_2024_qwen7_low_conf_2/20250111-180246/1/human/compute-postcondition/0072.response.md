The code snippet appends a formatted string to the `output` list. Specifically, it appends the string `'x x'` to `output`. However, the value of `x` is not defined in the given initial state, so we cannot determine the exact content of the appended string. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an input integer greater than 0 and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a non-empty list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where at least one element is 0, `g0` is a non-empty list, `g1` is a list containing at least one index `i` such that `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list containing all the indices `i` such that `occ[i] != 1`, `i` is \(n + 1\), `output` is a list containing the string `'x x'`, and `v` is an integer less than `k`**.
