`v` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `v` is the original value of `v` plus 1. The value of `output` is determined by the string formatting `f'{x}'`, which means it depends on the value of `x`. Since `x` is not affected by the code snippet, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`v` is the original value of `v` plus 1; `output` contains the string `f'{x}'`**
