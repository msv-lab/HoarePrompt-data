According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0 and within the specified range (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000). 

Before the loop starts, the state is given as `t` being an input integer. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5000**
