The code `print(' '.join(output))` does not modify any variables but instead prints the content of the `output` list with elements joined by spaces. Since no variables are changed, the only thing affected is the output of the program.

Let's break down the initial state:
- `g1` is a list of elements whose occurrences in `a` are greater than 1.
- `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` for each element `x` in `g1` such that `v < k` holds, where `v` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `g1`, and `i` is the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`).

Since the code only prints the content of `output` and does not modify any variables, the values of `g1`, `output`, `v`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The output state will include the printed content of `output`.

Output State: **`g1` is a list of elements whose occurrences in `a` are greater than 1, `output` is a list containing the string `f'{x}'` for each element `x` in `g1` such that `v < k` holds, `v` is the minimum of `k` and the number of elements in `g1`, `i` is the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`), and the program prints the content of `output`.**
