You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    6 2
    
    5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2

Output

    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is \(2 \times n\), `a` is a list of integers from the input, `occ` is a list of \(n + 1\) elements where all elements are 0, `g0` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 0`, `g1` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] == 1`, `g2` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `occ[i] > 1`, `v` is the final value of `v` after all iterations, `output` is a list of string representations of integers and pairs of integers as described in the loop logic, `i` is the length of `occ` (which is `n + 1`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of test cases \(t\), the values of \(n\) and \(k\), and an array \(a\) of \(2n\) integers where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice. It then identifies elements in the array \(a\) based on their occurrences (0, 1, or more than 1 times) and constructs an output list according to specific rules. Specifically, it selects elements from the groups with occurrences greater than 1 and exactly 1, ensuring the total count of selected elements is at most \(2k\). Finally, it prints the constructed output list for each test case. The function does not return anything explicitly but prints the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by constructing two arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` each, where the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization and Counting Occurrences**: It initializes a list `occ` to count the occurrences of each integer from 1 to `n`. Then, it categorizes the integers into three groups: `g0` (integers with zero occurrences), `g1` (integers with one occurrence), and `g2` (integers with more than one occurrence).

3. **Constructing `l` and `r`**:
   - The program first attempts to fill `l` and `r` using elements from `g2` (since these have more than one occurrence, they can be used directly).
   - After using elements from `g2`, it uses elements from `g1` (each has exactly one occurrence, so it can only be used once per array).
   - Finally, it uses elements from `g0` (each has zero occurrences, so they don't affect the XOR result).

4. **Ensuring Lengths**: The program ensures that both `l` and `r` are of length `2k` by adding elements from `g0` and `g1` as needed.

However, the program has a logical flaw. The XOR of elements in `l` and `r` will only match if the XOR of the remaining elements (after constructing `l` and `r`) is zero. This is not guaranteed by the current approach, especially since it doesn't explicitly ensure that the XOR of the remaining elements is handled correctly.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of why the current implementation might fail:

- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Elements**: The program does not explicitly check or handle the remaining elements after constructing `l` and `r` to ensure their XOR sums match. The approach relies on the assumption that using elements from `g0` and `g1` will inherently balance out the XOR values, which is not necessarily true.

Given the above reasoning, the program might not always produce correct outputs due to this oversight. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
