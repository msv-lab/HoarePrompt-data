The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of test cases \(t\), the values of \(n\) and \(k\), and an array \(a\) of \(2n\) integers where each integer from 1 to \(n\) appears exactly twice. It then identifies elements in the array \(a\) based on their occurrences (0, 1, or more than 1 times) and constructs an output list according to specific rules. Specifically, it selects elements from the groups with occurrences greater than 1 and exactly 1, ensuring the total count of selected elements is at most \(2k\). Finally, it prints the constructed output list for each test case. The function does not return anything explicitly but prints the results directly.
