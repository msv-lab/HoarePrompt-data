The function `func_1` reads a single input line from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers. It then splits this line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. There are no specific parameters passed to the function; instead, it relies on the user to provide the necessary input. If the input does not conform to the expected format (i.e., a sequence of integers separated by spaces), the function will raise a `ValueError`.
