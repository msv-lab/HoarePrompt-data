You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Initially, we had one array, which was a permutation of size n (an array of
size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once).

We performed q operations. During the i -th operation, we did the following:

  * choose any array we have with at least 2 elements; 
  * split it into two non-empty arrays (prefix and suffix); 
  * write two integers l_i and r_i , where l_i is the maximum element in the left part which we get after the split, and r_i is the maximum element in the right part; 
  * remove the array we've chosen from the pool of arrays we can use, and add the two resulting parts into the pool. 

For example, suppose the initial array was [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] , and we
performed the following operations:

  1. choose the array [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] . Then we write l_1 = 6 and r_1 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] ; 
  2. choose the array [4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [4, 1, 2] and [5] . Then we write l_2 = 4 and r_2 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4, 1, 2] and [5] ; 
  3. choose the array [4, 1, 2] and split it into [4] and [1, 2] . Then we write l_3 = 4 and r_3 = 2 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4] , [1, 2] and [5] . 

You are given two integers n and q , and two sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] . A permutation of size n is called valid if we can
perform q operations and produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] .

Calculate the number of valid permutations.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains q integers l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q (1 \le l_i \le n ).

The third line contains q integers r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q (1 \le r_i \le n ).

Additional constraint on the input: there exists at least one permutation
which can produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q] and [r_1, r_2,
\dots, r_q] .

Output

Print one integer â€” the number of valid permutations, taken modulo 998244353 .
