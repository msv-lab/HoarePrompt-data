    #The program returns a list of integers generated by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a single input line from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated sequence of integers. It then splits this line into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. There are no specific parameters passed to the function; instead, it relies on the user to provide the necessary input. If the input does not conform to the expected format (i.e., a sequence of integers separated by spaces), the function will raise a `ValueError`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and two lists l and r are provided where l is a list of q integers and r is a list of q integers. Each integer in l and r is between 1 and n, inclusive.
def func_2():

    #The program waits for user input and then returns an integer value
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and waits for user input, which must be an integer. It then returns this integer value. There are no additional actions performed by the function. Potential edge cases include the user entering non-integer values, in which case the function will raise an error and the calling program will need to handle this exception.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 × 10^5, l is a list of q integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ l_i ≤ n, and r is a list of q integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ r_i ≤ n.

    #The program returns a map object containing integers converted from user input split by spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes user input split by spaces and returns a map object containing integers. The function reads a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer using the `map` function, and returns the resulting map object. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or non-integer values in the input string. If the input contains non-integer values, they will be ignored, and only the valid integers will be included in the returned map object.

def func_4():

    #input value stripped of leading and trailing whitespace
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4()` reads a single string input from the standard input, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the modified string. This operation is performed every time the function is called. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. Here, `n` and `q` are positive integers with constraints `1 ≤ q < n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`, `l` is a list of `q` positive integers, and `r` is another list of `q` positive integers. The function constructs a linked list using these parameters and then calculates a specific value based on the structure of this linked list.

1. It initializes a list `nodes` of length `n + 1` with `None` values.
2. For each pair of indices `(l[i], r[i])` from the lists `l` and `r`, it connects them in the linked list by adjusting the `le` (left) and `ri` (right) pointers in the `nodes` list.
3. After constructing the linked list, it determines the sequence of indices that follow the `ri` pointers from each node in the list, storing this sequence in the list `a`.
4. It then creates a segment array `seg` of length `n + 1` and updates it based on the sequence `a`, incrementing the count at indices corresponding to the sequence.
5. Finally, it iterates over the nodes in reverse order, counting the segments, and calculates the answer `ans` by multiplying the counts and taking the result modulo `m`.

The function returns `ans` which is the result of the final calculation modulo `m`.

Potential edge cases:
- If any of the nodes in the `nodes` list are not connected properly, the function will still construct the linked list and proceed with the calculations.
- If `l` or `r` contains invalid indices (not between 1 and `n`), the function will still attempt to connect the nodes as specified, but the linked list structure may be incorrect.

Missing functionality:
- The function assumes that all nodes are valid and that the indices in `l` and `r` are within the specified bounds. There is no explicit validation for these assumptions.
