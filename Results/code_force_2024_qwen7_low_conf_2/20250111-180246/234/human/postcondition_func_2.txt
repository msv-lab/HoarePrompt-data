The function processes user input split by spaces and returns a map object containing integers. The function reads a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer using the `map` function, and returns the resulting map object. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or non-integer values in the input string. If the input contains non-integer values, they will be ignored, and only the valid integers will be included in the returned map object.
