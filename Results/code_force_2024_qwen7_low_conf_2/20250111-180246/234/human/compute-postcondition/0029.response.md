Postcondition: ***`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `le` is `nodes[l[0]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[0]]`. If `le` is `True`, then `ri.le` is `le` and `ri.ri` is the value of `lri`. Otherwise, `le.ri` is `le` and `ri.le` is `ri`, and `lri` is `False`. If `ri` is `True`, then `le.ri` becomes `True`, `ri.le` becomes `ListNode` with value `l[0]`, and `ri` remains `ListNode` with value `r[0]`. Otherwise, `nodes[l[0]].ri` is `nodes[r[0]].le`, and `nodes[r[0]].le` is `nodes[l[0]].ri`.***
