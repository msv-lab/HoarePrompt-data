To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute. The loop runs from `i` in the range of `q`, meaning it starts at `i=0` and ends at `i=q-1`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `q` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment to `i+1`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it iterates, we need to check what values `i` and `q` should take for the next iteration.

Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **Initial Value of `i` is 1:**
   - If `i` is 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - Since `q` is greater than 1, the condition for continuing the loop is satisfied as long as `i` does not exceed `q-1`.

2. **Initial Value of `i` is 2:**
   - If `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (now 3) must still be less than `q`. Since `q` is greater than 1, `i` being 3 means `q` must be at least 4.

In both cases, the key is to ensure that `i` is incremented and remains within the bounds of the loop. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the current value of `i` and the value of `q`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **If `i` was initially 1:**
   - After the first iteration (`i=1`), the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - To continue the loop, `i` (now 2) must be less than `q`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 and `q` must remain greater than 1.

2. **If `i` was initially 2:**
   - After the first iteration (`i=2`), the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - To continue the loop, `i` (now 3) must be less than `q`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 and `q` must be at least 4.

### Conclusion:

- If `i` was initially 1, it will become 2.
- If `i` was initially 2, it will become 3.

Since the problem doesn't specify which of these initial values `i` had, we need to cover both possibilities. However, the key point is that `i` will increase by 1, and `q` must remain consistent with its initial condition of being greater than 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**`i` is 2 (if it was 1 initially) or 3 (if it was 2 initially), `q` must be greater than 1.**

However, since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we should provide the most general answer based on the logic derived:

State: **`i` is either 2 or 3, `q` must be greater than 1.**
