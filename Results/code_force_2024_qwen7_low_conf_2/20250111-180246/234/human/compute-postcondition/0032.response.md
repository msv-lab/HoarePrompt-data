The code assigns the value of `le.ri` to the variable `lri`. Since `le` is `nodes[l[1]]`, and `ri` is `nodes[r[1]]`, the value of `le.ri` is taken and assigned to `lri`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1, `le` is `nodes[l[1]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[1]]`, `lri` is `le.ri`**
