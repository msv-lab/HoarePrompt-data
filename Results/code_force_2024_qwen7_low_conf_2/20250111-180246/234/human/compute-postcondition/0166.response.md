Postcondition: ***`seg` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `0`, `cnt` is either `cnt + seg[0]` or `cnt + seg[0] + 2` depending on whether `nodes[0]` is `True` or `False`, `q` must be at least `1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` containing the linked list structure, `a` contains the sequence of indices, `ans` is `1` if `nodes[0]` is `True` and `0` if `nodes[0]` is `False`, and `ans` is the original value of `ans` modulo `m`.***
