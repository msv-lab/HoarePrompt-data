`i` is assigned the value of `nodes[i].ri.v`. According to the initial state, `nodes[i]` is `nodes[2]` (since `i` was initially 2), and `nodes[2].ri.v` is `True`. Therefore, `i` is now assigned the value `True`.

Output State: **`i` is `True`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values including the new value 1, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[2].ri` is `True`**
