Postcondition: ***`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`; `a` contains the sequence of values starting from `i` and following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached; `i` is `None` since the loop terminates when `nodes[i].ri` is `None`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.***
