Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`; `a` contains the sequence of indices of all nodes in the linked list formed by the first `q` elements, each following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached; `i` is `None` or the index of the last node in the linked list, depending on whether the loop terminates normally or due to the `break` statement; `n` is a non-negative integer representing the length of the linked list minus one.**

### Explanation:
- **Nodes Structure**: The initial state specifies that `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, with the first `q` elements forming a linked list based on the values in `l` and `r`. The remaining elements are `None`.
- **List of Indices (`a`)**: The loop iterates through the nodes and collects the indices of all nodes in the linked list structure by following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached. This means `a` will contain the sequence of indices of all nodes in the linked list.
- **Termination of Loop**:
  - If the loop executes fully, `i` will be the index of the last node in the linked list, because the loop breaks when `nodes[i].ri` is `None`.
  - If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `n < 1`), `i` will be `None` and `a` will be an empty list.
- **Final Values**: After the loop completes, `a` will contain the sequence of indices of all nodes in the linked list, and `i` will be either the index of the last node or `None` if the loop did not execute. The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, representing the length of the linked list minus one.
