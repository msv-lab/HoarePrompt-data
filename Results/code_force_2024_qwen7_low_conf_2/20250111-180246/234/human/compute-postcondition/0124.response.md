`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `a`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the length and contents of `nodes` remain the same. The state of `nodes[i].ri` is also unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` with the same structure, `a` contains the sequence of values including the new value 1, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[i].ri` is `True`.**
