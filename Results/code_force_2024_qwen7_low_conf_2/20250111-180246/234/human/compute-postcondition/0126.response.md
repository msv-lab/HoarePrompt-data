The code assigns the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` to `i`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`
- `a` contains the sequence of values including the new value 1
- `nodes[n]` is not `None`
- `nodes[1].ri` is `True`

We know that `nodes[1].ri.v` is `True`, but since `ri.v` is expected to be a numeric value (likely an integer), we assume it evaluates to `1` in this context. Therefore, `i` will be updated to `1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values including the new value 1, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[1].ri` is `True`**
