`a` is appended with the value of `i`, which is `nodes[i].ri.v`. The list `a` is created and appended with this value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes` remains unchanged, and `a` contains the value `[nodes[i].ri.v]`.

Output State: **`i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes` remains unchanged, and `a` contains the value `[nodes[i].ri.v]`**
