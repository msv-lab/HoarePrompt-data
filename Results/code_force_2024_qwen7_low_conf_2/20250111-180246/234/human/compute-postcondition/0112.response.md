Postcondition: ***`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`. `a` contains the entire sequence of values starting from `1` and following the `ri` pointers. `i` is the index of the last node in the linked list. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
