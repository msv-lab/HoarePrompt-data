Postcondition: ***`q` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `le` is `nodes[l[0]]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[0]]`. If `ri` is `True`, then `le.ri` becomes `True`, `ri.le` becomes `ListNode` with value `l[0]`, and `rle` remains `False`. Otherwise, `nodes[l[0]].ri` is `nodes[r[0]].le`, and `nodes[r[0]].le` is `nodes[l[0]].ri`.***
