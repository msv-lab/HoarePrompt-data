Postcondition: ***`i` is either 2 or 3; `q` must be greater than 1; `le` is `ListNode(2)` or `ListNode(3)` with `le.le` and `le.ri` pointing to the appropriate nodes as follows: if `rle` is true, `le.le` is `rle` and `le.ri` is `ri`, with `rle.ri` and `ri.le` both pointing to `le`. If `rle` is false, `le.ri` points to `ri` and `ri.le` points to `le`.***
