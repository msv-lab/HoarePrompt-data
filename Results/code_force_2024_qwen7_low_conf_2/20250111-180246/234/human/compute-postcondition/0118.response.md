According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `nodes[i].le`. If `nodes[i].le` is not `None`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is now the value of `nodes[i].le.v` and `nodes[i].le` is not `None`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the current value of `nodes[i].le`. Since `nodes[i].le` is not `None` at the end of the last iteration, it means that `nodes[i].le` was not `None` in the last iteration. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `nodes[i].le` must still be not `None` after advancing `i` to the value of `nodes[i].le.v`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is not `None` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`i` is now the value of `nodes[i].le.v`, `nodes[i].le` is not `None` and `nodes[i].le` must be not `None` at the start of the next iteration**
