The `break` statement is executed within the loop, which means the loop is terminated immediately without performing any further iterations. The values of the variables outside the loop remain unchanged. 

### Updated Values:
- `i` remains the index of the first node where `nodes[i].ri` is `False`.
- `nodes` remains a list of length `n + 1` with the same structure.
- `a` contains the sequence of values starting from the initial value of `i` (which is `1`) and ending at the index where `nodes[i].ri` is `False`.
- `nodes[n]` is not `None`.
- `nodes[i].ri` is `False` at the end of the loop.

Since the `break` statement is executed, no further changes are made to the variables inside the loop.

### Output State
**Output State: `i` is the index of the first node where `nodes[i].ri` is `False`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` with the same structure, `a` contains the sequence of values starting from the initial value of `i` (which is `1`) and ending at the index where `nodes[i].ri` is `False`, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[i].ri` is `False`.**
