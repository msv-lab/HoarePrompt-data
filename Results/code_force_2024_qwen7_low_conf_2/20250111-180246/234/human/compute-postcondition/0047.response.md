Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `q` is greater than 1, `le` is a `ListNode` with value 1, `le.ri` is `ri`, `le.le` is `rle`. If `rle` is True, then `le.le` is `rle` and `le.ri` is `ri`. Otherwise, `le.le` is `rle` and `le.ri` is `ri`. If `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1, `le` is a `ListNode` with the value `l[1]`, `ri` is `nodes[r[1]]`, and `nodes[r[1]].le` is `nodes[l[1]]`, `nodes[l[1]].ri` is `nodes[r[1]]`***
