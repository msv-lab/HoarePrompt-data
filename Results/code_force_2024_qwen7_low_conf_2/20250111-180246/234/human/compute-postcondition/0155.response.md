To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement.

### Given Information:
- `seg` is a list of length `n+1`.
- `i` is `q-1`.
- `cnt` is either `cnt + seg[i-1]` or `1` depending on whether `nodes[i]` is `True` or `False`.
- `q` must be at least 1.
- `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` containing the linked list structure.
- `a` contains the sequence of indices.
- `ans` is `1` if `nodes[i]` is `True` and `0` if `nodes[i]` is `False`.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and Loop Condition**:
   - The loop starts from `i = n` and decrements `i` until it reaches `i = 1`.
   - Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `1`.

2. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be greater than `1` (i.e., `i > 1`).
   - Since `i` is currently `1` at the end of the last iteration, we need to decrement `i` to `0` to satisfy the condition for the next iteration (`i > 1`).

3. **Other Variables**:
   - `seg`, `cnt`, `nodes`, `a`, and `ans` do not change based on the loop itself; they only change within the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to these variables during the loop execution.
   - `q` remains unchanged as it does not participate in the loop condition.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` needs to be `0` to satisfy the loop condition `i > 1`.
- `n` remains the same as it does not change based on the loop.
- `q` remains at least `1` but does not change.

### Final Answer:
State: **`seg` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `0`, `cnt` is either `cnt + seg[i-1]` or `1` depending on whether `nodes[i]` is `True` or `False`, `q` must be at least `1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` containing the linked list structure, `a` contains the sequence of indices, `ans` is `1` if `nodes[i]` is `True` and `0` if `nodes[i]` is `False`.**
