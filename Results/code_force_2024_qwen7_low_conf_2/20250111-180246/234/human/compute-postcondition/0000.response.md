The function `func_3()` is called and assigns two values to `n` and `q`. However, the exact values returned by `func_3()` are not specified in the given code snippet. Therefore, `n` and `q` will be assigned the values returned by `func_3()`. The other variables (`l` and `r`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `q` < `n` ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `l` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `n`, and `r` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `n` and `q` are assigned values from `func_3()`**
