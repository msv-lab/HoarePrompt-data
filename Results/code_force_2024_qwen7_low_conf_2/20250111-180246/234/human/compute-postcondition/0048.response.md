Postcondition: ***`i` is either 1 or 2, `q` is greater than 1. In both cases, `le` and `ri` form a valid `ListNode` pair with their `le` and `ri` attributes properly set according to the conditions provided. Specifically:
- If `i` is 1 and `q` is greater than 1, `le.ri` is a `ListNode` with the value `r[1]` and `ri.le` is `nodes[l[1]]`. Depending on the boolean value of `lri`, `ri`'s `ri` attribute is set to `lri` or `le`'s `ri` attribute is set to `ri`.
- If `i` is 2 and `q` is greater than 1, `le` is a `ListNode` with value 1, `le.ri` is `ri`, and `le.le` is `rle`. Depending on the boolean value of `rle`, `le.le` is `rle` and `le.ri` is `ri`.***

This postcondition ensures that the relationships between `le` and `ri` are correctly maintained regardless of which branch of the if-else statement is executed, while adhering to the given preconditions.
