Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`.
   - The remaining elements are `None`.
   - `a` contains the sequence of values starting from `1` and following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached.
   - `i` is `1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   ```python
   while nodes[i].le:
   ```
   - The loop continues as long as `nodes[i].le` is truthy (i.e., not `None`).

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - We start with `i` set to `1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `nodes[1].le` must be truthy (i.e., not `None`).

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - The current state shows `i` is `1`. To ensure the loop executes, `nodes[1].le` must not be `None`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `nodes[1].le` must not be `None` to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the required adjustments to the program state are:

**State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`; `a` contains the sequence of values starting from `1` and following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached; `i` is `1`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `nodes[1].le` must not be `None`**.
