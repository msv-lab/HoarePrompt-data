According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. The loop will execute if `q` is at least 1. Here is the breakdown of the required adjustments:

1. **`q` must be greater than 0**: Since the loop iterates from `0` to `q-1`, `q` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

2. **`i` must be initialized to 0**: The loop starts with `i` being 0, and it will increment by 1 in each iteration.

Given the initial conditions and the requirements for the loop to execute:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le q < n\).
- `l` is a list of `q` positive integers where \(1 \le l_i \le n\).
- `r` is a list of `q` positive integers where \(1 \le r_i \le n\).
- `l` and `r` are the result of `func_1()`.
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements being `None`.

The only states that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `q` and `i`.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
