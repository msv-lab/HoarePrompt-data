`cnt` is incremented by 1, which means `cnt` is now `1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`seg` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `q-1`, `cnt` is `1`, `q` must be at least 1, `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` containing the linked list structure, `a` contains the sequence of indices, `ans` is `0`, and nodes[i] is `False`.**
