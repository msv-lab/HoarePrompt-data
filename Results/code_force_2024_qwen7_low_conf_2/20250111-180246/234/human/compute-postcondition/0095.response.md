To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the current state:

1. The while loop condition is `nodes[i].le`.
2. This means the loop continues as long as `nodes[i].le` is not `None`.

Given the current state:
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`.
- `a` contains the sequence of values starting from `1` and following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached.
- `i` is `v1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `nodes[1].le` must not be `None`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[i].le` must be `None` at the end of the previous iteration. However, since the loop condition is `nodes[i].le`, the loop will stop when `nodes[i].le` becomes `None`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is `None` at the end of the previous iteration.

The only state that needs to be adjusted is `nodes[i].le` becoming `None`.

State: **`nodes[1].le` must be `None`**
