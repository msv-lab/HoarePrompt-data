Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `nodes[i].le`. This means the loop will continue as long as `nodes[i].le` is `True`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `nodes[1].le` must be `None`, and `i` is `None`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `nodes[i].le` must be `True`. Given that `nodes[1].le` must be `None` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `nodes[i].le` becomes `True`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `nodes[1].le` must be `None`, this implies that `nodes[1]` has no left child (`le` is `None`). 
   - To make `nodes[i].le` `True`, `i` must be set to an index where `nodes[i].le` is `True`. Since `i` is currently `None`, we need to specify a valid index for `i` where `nodes[i].le` is `True`.
   
Given these points, we need to set `i` to a specific index where `nodes[i].le` is `True`.

**Answer**:
State: **`nodes[1].le` must be `None`, `i` must be an index where `nodes[i].le` is `True`**
