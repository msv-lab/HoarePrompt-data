The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or nested structure. In this case, the loop or nested structure that was iterating over the linked list (defined by `l` and `r`) has been exited. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`; `a` contains the sequence of values starting from `i` and following the `ri` pointers until a node with `ri` being `None` is reached; `i` is `None` since the loop terminates when `nodes[i].ri` is `None`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
