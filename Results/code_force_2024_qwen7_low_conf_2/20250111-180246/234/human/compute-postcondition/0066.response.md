Postcondition: ***`i` is either 2 or 3, `q` must be greater than 1. If `ri` is true, then `le.le` is `rle` and `le.ri` is `ri`, with `rle.ri` and `ri.le` both pointing to `le`. If `ri` is false, then `nodes[2].ri` is equal to the previous value of `nodes[3].le`, and `nodes[3].le` is equal to the previous value of `nodes[2].ri`.***
