`a.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `a`. The value of `i` is the index of the last node in the linked list structure formed by `nodes[n]` and subsequent nodes. The values of the other variables (`nodes`, `n`, and `nodes[n]`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is the index of the last node in the linked list structure formed by `nodes[n]` and subsequent nodes, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` with the same structure, `a` contains the sequence of values including the new value `i`, `nodes[n]` is not `None`.**
