To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop and the current state of the variables.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while nodes[i].le:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that the loop continues as long as `nodes[i].le` is not `None`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`.
- `a` is an empty list.
- `i` is `nodes[i].le.v`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the expression `nodes[i].le` must be `not None`. 

Let's break down the relevant part:
- The value of `i` is determined by `nodes[i].le.v`, which means `i` is the value of `le.v` for the node at index `i` in the `nodes` list.
- To continue the loop, `nodes[i].le` must not be `None`.

Since `nodes[i]` refers to the node at index `i` in the `nodes` list, and `nodes[i].le` is a pointer to the next node in the linked list, for the loop to execute again, `nodes[i].le` must point to a valid node (i.e., not `None`).

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to ensure that `nodes[i].le` is not `None`.

The final answer is:
State: **`nodes[i].le` is not `None`**
