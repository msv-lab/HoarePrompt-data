The code assigns the value of `nodes[i].ri.v` to `i`. Since `nodes[i].ri.v` is the original value of `i`, assigning it back to `i` does not change the value of `i`. The precondition that `nodes[i].ri` must be truthy is also maintained.

Output State: **`i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes` remains unchanged, and `nodes[i].ri` must be truthy**
