Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial States:
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `le` is `nodes[l[0]]`
- `ri` is `nodes[r[0]]`
- The conditions for updating `le` and `ri` based on their values have already been executed.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(q):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < q - 1`.
- Since `i` is currently 0, the loop needs to check if `i < q - 1` to determine if it should execute again.
- At the end of the previous iteration (i.e., when `i` was 0), we need to determine the new states for `i` and any other relevant variables.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `q` must be greater than 0

2. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `i < q - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < q - 1` simplifies to `0 < q - 1` or simply `q > 1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - Increment `i` by 1: `i` will become 1.
   - `q` remains unchanged, but since we are checking the condition `q > 1`, `q` must still be greater than 1.

### Final Adjusted States:
- `i` is now 1
- `q` must be greater than 1

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `q` must be greater than 1**
