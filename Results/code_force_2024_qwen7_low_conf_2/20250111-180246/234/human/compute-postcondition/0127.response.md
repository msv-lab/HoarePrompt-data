`a` is a sequence that appends the value of `i`, which is currently 1. After appending, the value of `i` remains unchanged, but the sequence `a` now includes the new value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` contains the sequence of values including the new value 1, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[1].ri` is `True`.**
