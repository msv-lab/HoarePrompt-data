The code `lri = le.ri` assigns the value of `le.ri` to the variable `lri`. Since `le` is given as `nodes[l[0]]` and is True, `le.ri` is also True. Therefore, `lri` is set to True.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state: `q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `le` is nodes[l[0]], `ri` is nodes[r[0]], and `le` is True.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `le` is nodes[l[0]], `ri` is nodes[r[0]], `le` is True, `lri` is True**
