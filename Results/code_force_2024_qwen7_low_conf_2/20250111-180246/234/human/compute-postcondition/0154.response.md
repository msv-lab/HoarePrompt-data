Postcondition: **`seg` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `q-1`, `cnt` is either `cnt + seg[i-1]` or `1` depending on whether `nodes[i]` is `True` or `False`, `q` must be at least 1, `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` containing the linked list structure, `a` contains the sequence of indices, `ans` is `1` if `nodes[i]` is `True` and `0` if `nodes[i]` is `False`.**
