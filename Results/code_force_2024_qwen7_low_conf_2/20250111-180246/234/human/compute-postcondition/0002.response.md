The code initializes a list `nodes` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `None`. This means that the length of `nodes` is now `n + 1`, and each element in this list is `None`.

- The initial lengths and contents of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
- The values of `n` and `q` remain unchanged.
- The values in `l` and `r` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5\); `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le q < n\); `l` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `n`; `r` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `l` and `r` are the result of `func_1()`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements being `None`.**
