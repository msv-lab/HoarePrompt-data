The code `i = nodes[i].le.v` updates the value of `i` to be the value of `nodes[i].le.v`. Given the precondition that `nodes[i].le` is not `None` and must be not `None` at the start of the next iteration, this assignment changes the value of `i` but does not affect the state of `nodes[i].le`.

Output State: **`i` is now the value of `nodes[i].le.v`, `nodes[i].le` is not `None`**
