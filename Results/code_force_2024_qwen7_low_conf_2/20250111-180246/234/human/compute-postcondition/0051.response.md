The code assigns the value of `le.ri` to `lri`. The previous value of `le.ri` is part of the initial state, which means `le.ri` is from `nodes[r[i]]`. Therefore, the value of `lri` is now the same as `le.ri`, which is from `nodes[r[i]]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `q` must be greater than 1; `le` is from `nodes[l[i]]`; `ri` is from `nodes[r[i]]`; `lri` is from `nodes[r[i]]`**
