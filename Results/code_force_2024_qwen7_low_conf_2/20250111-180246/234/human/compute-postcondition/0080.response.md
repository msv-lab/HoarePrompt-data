Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`.
   - The first `q` elements of `nodes` form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`.
   - The remaining elements are `None`.
   - `a` is a list containing the value `i`.
   - `i` is the index of the node in the linked list where `nodes[i].ri` is `None`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `nodes[i].ri`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `nodes[i].ri` must be non-`None` (i.e., it should point to another node in the linked list).
   - Currently, `i` is set such that `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, meaning the loop cannot execute as per the current state.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To allow the loop to execute at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `nodes[i].ri` is non-`None`.
   - Since `i` is the index of the node where `nodes[i].ri` is `None`, we need to change this condition to make `nodes[i].ri` point to some valid node in the linked list.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - We need to adjust the state so that `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`. This can be achieved by ensuring that there is a valid next node for the current node `nodes[i]`.

Given these considerations, the required adjustment is to ensure that `nodes[i].ri` is not `None`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the first `q` elements form a linked list structure based on the values in `l` and `r`, and the remaining elements are `None`; `a` is a list containing the value `i`; `i` is the index of the node in the linked list where `nodes[i].ri` is `not None`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**
