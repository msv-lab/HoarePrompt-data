Postcondition: ***`seg` is a list of length `n+1`, `i` is `0`, `cnt` is either `cnt + seg[i-1] + 1` or `2` depending on whether `nodes[i]` is `True` or `False`, `q` must be at least `1`, `nodes` is a list of length `n+1` containing the linked list structure, `a` contains the sequence of indices, `ans` is `1` if `nodes[i]` is `True` and `0` if `nodes[i]` is `False`. If `nodes[i]` is `True`, `cnt` is adjusted according to `seg[0]` or `1`; otherwise, `cnt` is adjusted according to `seg[i-1] + 1` or `2`, and `ans` is the remainder of `ans` divided by `m`.***
