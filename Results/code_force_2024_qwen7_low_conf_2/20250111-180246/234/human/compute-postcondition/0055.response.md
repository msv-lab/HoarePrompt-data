The line of code `le.ri, ri.le = ri, le` swaps the `ri` attribute of `le` and the `le` attribute of `ri`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is either 2 or 3
- `q` must be greater than 1
- `le` is from `nodes[l[i]]`
- `ri` is a `ListNode` with the value `r[i]`
- `lri` is from `nodes[r[i]]`

After the code is executed:
- The `ri` attribute of `le` will now hold what was originally in `ri.le`.
- The `le` attribute of `ri` will now hold what was originally in `le.ri`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `le.ri` is now `ri`
- `ri.le` is now `le`

Output State: **`i` is either 2 or 3; `q` must be greater than 1; `le` is from `nodes[l[i]]`; `ri` is a `ListNode` with the value `r[i]`; `lri` is from `nodes[r[i]]`; `le.ri` is `ri`; `ri.le` is `le`**
