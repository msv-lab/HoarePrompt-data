`a` is a sequence that includes the value `i`, which is `True`. The code appends `i` (which is `True`) to the list `a`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated list `a` will contain both the original sequence of values and the value `True`.

Output State: **`i` is `True`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1`, `a` is the sequence of values including the new value `True`, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[2].ri` is `True`**
