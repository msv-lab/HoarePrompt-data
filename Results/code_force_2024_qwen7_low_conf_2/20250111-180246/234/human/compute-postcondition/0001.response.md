The code assigns the result of `func_1()` to both `l` and `r`. Since `func_1()` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. However, we know that `l` and `r` are lists of length `q` where each element is a positive integer between 1 and `n`.

Given the initial conditions, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `l` and `r` are lists of `q` positive integers where each element is between 1 and `n`. After executing the code, `l` and `r` are updated to be the result of `func_1()`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5\); `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le q < n\); `l` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `l_i` ≤ `n`; `r` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `r_i` ≤ `n`; `l` and `r` are the result of `func_1()`**
