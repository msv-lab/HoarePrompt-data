Postcondition: ***`i` is the index of the first node where `nodes[i].ri` is `False`, `nodes` is a list of length `n + 1` with the same structure, `a` contains the sequence of values starting from the initial value of `i` (which is `1`) and ending at the index where `nodes[i].ri` is `False`, `nodes[n]` is not `None`, and `nodes[i].ri` is `False`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true regardless of the if condition.***
