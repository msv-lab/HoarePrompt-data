`a` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, and `nodes` remains unchanged. The state of `nodes[i].ri` being truthy is also maintained.

Output State: **`i` is `nodes[i].ri.v`, `nodes` remains unchanged, `nodes[i].ri` must be truthy, and `a` contains the value of `i`.**
