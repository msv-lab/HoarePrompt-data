The function `func_5` accepts four parameters: `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`. The constraints are as follows: `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq q < n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `l` is a list of `q` positive integers where \(1 \leq l_i \leq n\), and `r` is a list of `q` positive integers where \(1 \leq r_i \leq n\). The function performs some iterations and returns `ans` which is the result of `ans` modulo `m` after all iterations.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_5` is to accept parameters `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r`, perform certain iterations, and return the result of `ans` modulo `m` after all iterations.
