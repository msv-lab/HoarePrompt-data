Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input reading process, splitting the input into the required lists and integers.
2. **Linked List Construction**: The `func_5` function correctly constructs a linked list based on the given pairs of maximum elements in the left and right parts of the split arrays. This construction is done by setting up `le` (left) and `ri` (right) pointers for each node.
3. **Sequence Calculation**: The function calculates the sequence of indices (`a`) by traversing the linked list using the `ri` pointers. This sequence helps in understanding how the nodes are connected.
4. **Segment Array**: The segment array `seg` is correctly updated to reflect the structure of the linked list, specifically focusing on the transitions between different segments.
5. **Final Calculation**: The function calculates the number of valid permutations by iterating over the nodes in reverse order, counting segments, and performing the necessary multiplications under modulo `m`. This step ensures that the solution is consistent with the problem's requirements.
6. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo `m` (`998244353`) is appropriate to avoid overflow and ensure the result fits within a standard integer range.
7. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as invalid indices and improperly connected nodes by attempting to follow the instructions without checking for validity explicitly, which is permissible given the problem constraints.

Given that the logic in `func_5` aligns with the problem description and correctly performs the required operations, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
