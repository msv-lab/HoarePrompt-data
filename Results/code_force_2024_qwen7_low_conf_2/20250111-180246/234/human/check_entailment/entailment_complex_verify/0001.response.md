### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly parse the input as required. However, the actual input parsing logic is implemented in `func_3`, which reads a list of integers. This function is not used in the provided code, so the current implementation is incomplete.

2. **Node Management**:
   - The program uses a custom node structure `ListNode` to manage the linked list representation of the operations. This is done correctly, and nodes are dynamically created and linked to form the necessary subarrays after each split operation.

3. **Reconstructing Permutations**:
   - After all operations, the program attempts to reconstruct the possible original permutations by traversing the linked list and recording the order of elements. This part of the logic is sound, but there are some issues with how the linked list is managed and traversed.

4. **Segment Tree and Counting**:
   - The segment tree `seg` is used to count how many times each element has been processed as either the leftmost or rightmost element in the remaining sequence. This is a critical part of the algorithm, and it seems to be implemented correctly. However, the traversal logic and the way the counts are accumulated might have issues.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of modulo \(998244353\) is appropriate and ensures that intermediate results do not overflow, which is essential for combinatorial problems.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Linked List Traversal**:
  - The linked list traversal logic is somewhat flawed. Specifically, the traversal should ensure that the sequence of elements captured in `a` is correct. The current implementation might skip elements or include them incorrectly, especially when dealing with complex splits.

- **Segment Tree Initialization**:
  - The initialization of the segment tree `seg` might not cover all cases correctly. The indices and the way counts are incremented could lead to incorrect results.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The final calculation of `ans` might be incorrect if the linked list traversal and segment tree updates are not handled properly. The logic for counting the valid permutations should be thoroughly checked.

### Conclusion:

While the overall approach of using linked lists and segment trees is sound, the current implementation contains several flaws in the linked list management and traversal logic. These issues could lead to incorrect results or even incorrect permutations being counted.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was too optimistic, and the provided code does not handle all cases correctly. A more thorough review and potential refactoring of the linked list traversal and segment tree logic are needed to ensure the program's correctness.
