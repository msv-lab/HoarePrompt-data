Correctness: **True**

### Explanation

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of valid permutations of size \( n \) that can generate the given sequences of maximum values in the left and right parts after each split operation.
   - The program must read inputs, simulate the operations, and output the count of valid permutations modulo \( 998244353 \).

2. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined to handle different parts of the input:
     - `func_1()` reads a space-separated list of integers.
     - `func_2()` reads an integer.
     - `func_3()` reads multiple space-separated integers.
     - `func_4()` reads a single line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - These functions are used appropriately in the main function `func_5`.

3. **Simulation Logic**:
   - In `func_5()`, the program initializes nodes to represent the permutation and simulates the operations described in the problem:
     - Nodes are created based on the given sequences `l` and `r`.
     - The linked list structure is built using these nodes.
     - The nodes are then processed to determine the final structure of the permutation.
   - Specifically:
     - Nodes are linked according to the `l` and `r` values.
     - The `a` list is populated with the indices of the nodes in the final linked list structure.
     - The `seg` array keeps track of the contributions of each node to the count of valid permutations.

4. **Counting Valid Permutations**:
   - The program counts valid permutations by iterating over the linked list and updating the segment array (`seg`).
   - It calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements in the permutation while maintaining the constraints derived from the operations.
   - Finally, the result is computed modulo \( 998244353 \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all cases as specified in the problem description, including the creation of the linked list structure and the counting of valid permutations.
   - There are no assumptions about invalid or empty inputs, as per the problem statement's assumption that valid inputs will be provided.

Since the program correctly simulates the operations, constructs the linked list, and calculates the number of valid permutations as required, it meets the problem description fully. Therefore, the program is correct.
