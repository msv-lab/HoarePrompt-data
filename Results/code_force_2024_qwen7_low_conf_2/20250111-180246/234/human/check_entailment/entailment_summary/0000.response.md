Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a given sequence of operations on permutations can result in a specific set of maximum values (`l` and `r`). The operations involve splitting arrays and recording the maximum values of their left and right parts.
2. The function `func_5` aims to reconstruct the original permutation based on the given sequences `l` and `r` by building a linked list and performing certain operations on it.
3. The function constructs a linked list where each node represents an element in the permutation. The `le` and `ri` pointers are used to represent the left and right parts of the split operations.
4. After constructing the linked list, the function extracts the sequence of elements following the `ri` pointers, which helps in understanding the structure of the original permutation.
5. The function then calculates the number of valid permutations based on the structure of the linked list and the given sequences `l` and `r`.
6. The function handles the constraints and potential edge cases appropriately, such as ensuring the indices are within bounds and constructing the linked list correctly.

Given the detailed explanation and the execution summary, the function `func_5` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function constructs the linked list and calculates the number of valid permutations based on the given sequences `l` and `r`.
