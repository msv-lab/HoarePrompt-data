You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Initially, we had one array, which was a permutation of size n (an array of
size n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly once).

We performed q operations. During the i -th operation, we did the following:

  * choose any array we have with at least 2 elements; 
  * split it into two non-empty arrays (prefix and suffix); 
  * write two integers l_i and r_i , where l_i is the maximum element in the left part which we get after the split, and r_i is the maximum element in the right part; 
  * remove the array we've chosen from the pool of arrays we can use, and add the two resulting parts into the pool. 

For example, suppose the initial array was [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] , and we
performed the following operations:

  1. choose the array [6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] . Then we write l_1 = 6 and r_1 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] and [4, 1, 2, 5] ; 
  2. choose the array [4, 1, 2, 5] and split it into [4, 1, 2] and [5] . Then we write l_2 = 4 and r_2 = 5 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4, 1, 2] and [5] ; 
  3. choose the array [4, 1, 2] and split it into [4] and [1, 2] . Then we write l_3 = 4 and r_3 = 2 , and the arrays we have are [6, 3] , [4] , [1, 2] and [5] . 

You are given two integers n and q , and two sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] . A permutation of size n is called valid if we can
perform q operations and produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q]
and [r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q] .

Calculate the number of valid permutations.

Input

The first line contains two integers n and q (1 \le q < n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains q integers l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q (1 \le l_i \le n ).

The third line contains q integers r_1, r_2, \dots, r_q (1 \le r_i \le n ).

Additional constraint on the input: there exists at least one permutation
which can produce the given sequences [l_1, l_2, \dots, l_q] and [r_1, r_2,
\dots, r_q] .

Output

Print one integer — the number of valid permutations, taken modulo 998244353 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given operations. Specifically, the program uses a linked list structure to manage the segments of the array, but the way it processes the segments and calculates the number of valid permutations is flawed.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The program attempts to maintain a linked list structure for the segments, but it does not correctly update the segments after each operation. For instance, when a segment is split, the linked list pointers are not updated properly to reflect the new segments.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Permutations**: The program tries to use a segment tree-like approach to count the valid permutations, but the logic for updating the segment tree is incorrect. It fails to account for the correct merging and splitting of segments as described in the problem statement.

3. **Potential Example Where Program Fails**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   6 3
   6 4 4
   5 5 2
   ```
   The initial array is `[6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]`. According to the problem, the operations would proceed as follows:
   - Operation 1: Split `[6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]` into `[6, 3]` and `[4, 1, 2, 5]`. So, `l_1 = 6` and `r_1 = 5`.
   - Operation 2: Split `[4, 1, 2, 5]` into `[4, 1, 2]` and `[5]`. So, `l_2 = 4` and `r_2 = 5`.
   - Operation 3: Split `[4, 1, 2]` into `[4]` and `[1, 2]`. So, `l_3 = 4` and `r_3 = 2`.

   The program would fail to correctly process these operations and calculate the number of valid permutations. For example, the linked list structure might not be updated correctly, leading to incorrect counts.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
