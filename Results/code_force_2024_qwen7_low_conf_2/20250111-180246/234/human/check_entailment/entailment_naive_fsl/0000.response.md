Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given operations. Specifically, the program uses a linked list structure to manage the segments of the array, but the way it processes the segments and calculates the number of valid permutations is flawed.

Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The program attempts to maintain a linked list structure for the segments, but it does not correctly update the segments after each operation. For instance, when a segment is split, the linked list pointers are not updated properly to reflect the new segments.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Permutations**: The program tries to use a segment tree-like approach to count the valid permutations, but the logic for updating the segment tree is incorrect. It fails to account for the correct merging and splitting of segments as described in the problem statement.

3. **Potential Example Where Program Fails**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   6 3
   6 4 4
   5 5 2
   ```
   The initial array is `[6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]`. According to the problem, the operations would proceed as follows:
   - Operation 1: Split `[6, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5]` into `[6, 3]` and `[4, 1, 2, 5]`. So, `l_1 = 6` and `r_1 = 5`.
   - Operation 2: Split `[4, 1, 2, 5]` into `[4, 1, 2]` and `[5]`. So, `l_2 = 4` and `r_2 = 5`.
   - Operation 3: Split `[4, 1, 2]` into `[4]` and `[1, 2]`. So, `l_3 = 4` and `r_3 = 2`.

   The program would fail to correctly process these operations and calculate the number of valid permutations. For example, the linked list structure might not be updated correctly, leading to incorrect counts.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
