Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the key components step-by-step:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input parsing functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly read the input as required.
   - The main logic is encapsulated within `func_4`.

2. **Node Management**:
   - The program uses a custom node structure `ListNode` to manage the linked list representation of the operations. This allows tracking of the maximum values in the left and right parts during each operation.
   - Nodes are dynamically created and linked to form the necessary subarrays after each split operation.

3. **Reconstructing Permutations**:
   - After all operations, the program attempts to reconstruct the possible original permutations by traversing the linked list and recording the order of elements.
   - The `a` list captures the sequence of elements as determined by the linked list traversal.

4. **Segment Tree and Counting**:
   - The segment tree `seg` is used to count how many times each element has been processed as either the leftmost or rightmost element in the remaining sequence.
   - The `ans` variable calculates the number of valid permutations by considering the frequency of each element being involved in the splits.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - All intermediate results are kept modulo \(998244353\) to handle large numbers, which is a common practice in combinatorial problems.

Given the constraints and the provided example, the code appears to follow the problem statement correctly. It handles the dynamic creation and manipulation of linked lists, reconstructs the potential permutations, and computes the number of valid permutations efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
