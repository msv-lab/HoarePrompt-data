Reasoning:
The program logic appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description. The function `func_1` evaluates the conditions and returns the appropriate string ('YES' or 'NO') based on the rules specified:

1. If `m == k` or `k > n`, it returns 'NO', which aligns with the requirement that Bob can either match his number of repainting parts to the number of colors or exceed the number of parts, making it possible for him to paint all parts the same.
2. If `m > k`, it returns 'YES', which means Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
3. The "else" condition, though redundant because it will always evaluate to 'NO' when neither of the previous conditions are met, does not alter the correctness since it still returns 'NO' in those cases.

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the program logic matches the expected behavior for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
