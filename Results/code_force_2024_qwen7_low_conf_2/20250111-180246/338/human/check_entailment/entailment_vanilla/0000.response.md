Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic and compare it with the requirements stated in the problem description.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `t` (the number of test cases).
2. **Function Call**: It calls `func_1(n, m, k)` for each test case.
3. **Output Format**: The output should be "YES" or "NO" for each test case, matching the specified format.

### Function Analysis (`func_1`):
- **Conditions Checked**:
  - If `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns `'NO'`. This condition checks whether Bob has enough power to potentially equalize all parts.
  - If `m > k`, the function returns `'YES'`. This condition checks if there are more than `k` distinct colors, making it impossible for Bob to repaint all parts to the same color.

### Detailed Verification:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m == k`: If Bob can repaint exactly `k` parts and there are `m` colors, he can potentially repaint `k` parts to any single color, thus making all parts the same color.
   - When `k > n`: In this case, Bob can potentially repaint all parts, so all parts can be made the same color regardless of the number of colors `m`.
   - When `m > k`: If there are more than `k` distinct colors, Bob cannot possibly repaint all parts to the same color since he can only change `k` parts.

2. **General Case**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the conditions where Alice can prevent Bob from equalizing the colors and where she cannot.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases match the logic in the function:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n=1, m=1, k=1` → `NO`
     - **Test Case 2**: `n=5, m=1, k=1` → `NO`
     - **Test Case 3**: `n=5, m=2, k=1` → `YES`
     - **Test Case 4**: `n=5, m=2, k=2` → `NO`
     - **Test Case 5**: `n=5, m=5, k=3` → `YES`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts the same color.

Correctness: **True**
