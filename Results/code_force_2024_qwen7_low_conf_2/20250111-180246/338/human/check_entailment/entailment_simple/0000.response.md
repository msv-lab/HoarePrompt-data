Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle all cases according to the rules outlined:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - The function checks if \(m == k\) or \(k > n\). If either condition is true, it returns 'NO'. However, this logic is incomplete.
   - The function should consider the following cases:
     - If \(m > k\), Alice can paint the ribbon such that no single color appears more than \(k\) times, making it impossible for Bob to repaint up to \(k\) parts to make all parts the same color.
     - If \(m \leq k\), Alice cannot guarantee that Bob cannot make all parts the same color because Bob can always repaint \(k\) parts to match the most frequent color.

2. **Example Test Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: \(n = 5\), \(m = 1\), \(k = 1\)
     - According to the problem, Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Here, \(m = 1\), which is less than \(k = 1\). The function should return 'YES' because Bob can still repaint one part to match the other, but the function returns 'NO'.
   - **Case 2**: \(n = 5\), \(m = 2\), \(k = 1\)
     - According to the problem, Alice can paint the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]. Here, \(m = 2\), which is greater than \(k = 1\). The function should return 'YES' because Bob cannot make all parts the same color. However, the function incorrectly returns 'NO'.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The logic needs to be adjusted to correctly identify the cases where Alice can ensure Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Return 'YES' if \(m > k\).
     - Return 'NO' otherwise.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for all given test cases, leading to incorrect outputs in some scenarios.
