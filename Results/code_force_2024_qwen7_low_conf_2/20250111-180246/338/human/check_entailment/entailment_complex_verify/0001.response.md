### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the logic of the program and the conditions checked by `func_1`.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly iterates over the number of test cases and processes each test case with the given values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If \( m == k \) or \( k > n \), it returns `'NO'`.
     - If \( m > k \), it returns `'YES'`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

3. **Detailed Verification**:
   - **Condition \( m == k \)**: This means that Bob can repaint exactly \( k \) parts, and if there are exactly \( k \) colors, he can potentially repaint all parts to the same color. Therefore, this condition is correct for returning `'NO'`.
   - **Condition \( k > n \)**: This means that Bob can repaint all \( n \) parts, so it is always possible to make all parts the same color. Therefore, this condition is correct for returning `'NO'`.
   - **Condition \( m > k \)**: This means that there are more than \( k \) distinct colors. Since Bob can only repaint up to \( k \) parts, he cannot make all parts the same color. Therefore, this condition is correct for returning `'YES'`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( m == k \) or \( k > n \): These conditions are correctly handled to return `'NO'`.
   - When \( m > k \): This condition is correctly handled to return `'YES'`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the conditions where Alice can prevent Bob from equalizing the colors and where she cannot.

6. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases match the logic in the function:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n=1, m=1, k=1` → `NO` (correct)
     - **Test Case 2**: `n=5, m=1, k=1` → `NO` (correct)
     - **Test Case 3**: `n=5, m=2, k=1` → `YES` (correct)
     - **Test Case 4**: `n=5, m=2, k=2` → `NO` (correct)
     - **Test Case 5**: `n=5, m=5, k=3` → `YES` (correct)

Based on the analysis, the original assessment correctly identified the logic and conditions of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
