You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob have bought a ribbon consisting of n parts. Now they want to
paint it.

First, Alice will paint every part of the ribbon into one of m colors. For
each part, she can choose its color arbitrarily.

Then, Bob will choose at most k  parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the
same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily).

Bob would like all parts to have the same color. However, Alice thinks that
this is too dull, so she wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob
cannot make all parts have the same color.

Is it possible to paint the ribbon in such a way?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing three integers n , m and k (1
\le m, k \le n \le 50 ) — the number of parts, the number of colors and the
number of parts Bob can repaint, respectively.

Output

For each test case, print YES if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot
make all parts have the same color. Otherwise, print NO.

You can print every letter in any register. For example, Yes, yes, yEs will
all be recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1
    
    5 1 1
    
    5 2 1
    
    5 2 2
    
    5 5 3

Output

    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first test case, a ribbon consists of 1 part. So all its parts will
always have the same color.

In the second test case, there is only 1 color.

In the third test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 1 part so that all parts have
the same color.

In the fourth test case, no matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob will
always be able to repaint 2 parts so that all parts have the same color.

In the fifth test case, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
. It's impossible to change the color of at most 3 parts so that all parts
have the same color.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, m, k))

def func_1(n, m, k):
    if m == k or k > n:
        return 'NO'
    elif m > k:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(n, m, k))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_1(n, m, k):
    if (m == k or k > n) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    else :
        if (m > k) :
            return 'YES'
            #The program returns 'YES'
        else :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. Based on the following conditions:
- If `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns 'NO'.
- If `m > k`, the function returns 'YES'.
- Otherwise, the function returns 'NO'.

The function covers all potential cases:
- When `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns 'NO'.
- When `m > k`, the function returns 'YES'.
- In any other case, the function also returns 'NO'.

The final state of the program after it concludes is that it returns either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `m == 1` and `k < n`. According to the problem description, if `m == 1`, it means there is only one color available. In this scenario, regardless of the value of `k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent him from doing so. However, the current implementation returns 'NO' for such cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 1
```
The expected output should be "YES" because with only one color, Bob can always repaint all parts to that color. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".
