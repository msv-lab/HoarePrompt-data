Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `m == 1` and `k < n`. According to the problem description, if `m == 1`, it means there is only one color available. In this scenario, regardless of the value of `k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, making it impossible for Alice to prevent him from doing so. However, the current implementation returns 'NO' for such cases, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 1
```
The expected output should be "YES" because with only one color, Bob can always repaint all parts to that color. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".
