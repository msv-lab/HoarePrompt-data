Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accurately determines whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color based on the given conditions. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `m == k` or `k > n`, the function returns 'NO'. This condition ensures that if Bob can repaint all colors (i.e., `m == k`) or if he has more parts to repaint than the total number of parts (`k > n`), Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
   - If `m > k`, the function returns 'YES'. This condition ensures that if the number of available colors is greater than the number of parts Bob can repaint, Alice can always paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.
   - Any other case falls into the 'NO' category.

2. **Input Constraints**:
   - The constraints `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50` are respected, ensuring the function operates within the expected ranges.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' as required, and it handles all test cases as demonstrated in the example.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
