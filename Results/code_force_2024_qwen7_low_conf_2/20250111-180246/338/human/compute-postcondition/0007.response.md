The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `k`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, and for each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` satisfy `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50`. 

The function returns either 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. There are three cases where the function returns either 'NO' or 'YES'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and return 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the conditions lead to 'NO', it returns 'NO'; if the conditions lead to 'YES', it returns 'YES'.
