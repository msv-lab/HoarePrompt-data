The code `print('NO')` does not change any variable's value; it only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `max_color` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\), print statement outputs 'NO'**
