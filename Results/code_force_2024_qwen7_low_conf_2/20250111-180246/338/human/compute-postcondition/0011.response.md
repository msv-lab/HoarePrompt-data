The code `max_color = (n + m - 1) / m` updates the value of `max_color`. The initial value of `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\). After executing this line, the value of `max_color` remains the same because the right-hand side of the equation does not change. The other variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\)**
