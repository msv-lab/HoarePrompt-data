The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `max_color` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\)**
