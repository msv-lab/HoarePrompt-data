The function `func` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function should handle a series of test cases internally, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that `1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, where `t` represents the number of test cases.

Given the described outputs and constraints, we need to consider the possible return values for each test case.

Case_1: The function processes a test case with `n`, `m`, and `k`. It returns a specific value or result based on the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Since the exact output logic is not provided, we can only describe the structure based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50), and returns a specific value or result for each test case based on their relationships.**
