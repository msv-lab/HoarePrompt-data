The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` (which were placeholders for the input integers) are now replaced with the actual input values.

The initial state also includes `t` being greater than 0, `i` being 1, and `max_color` being set to \((n + m - 1) / m\). However, since `n` and `m` are now replaced with the input values, `max_color` will now be recalculated based on these new values.

Therefore, the output state will include:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `n` is the first input integer
- `m` is the second input integer
- `k` is the third input integer
- `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\) using the new values of `n` and `m`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\)**
