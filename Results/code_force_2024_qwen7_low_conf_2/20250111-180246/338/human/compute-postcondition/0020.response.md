Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\). If `max_color + k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables' states.***
