The code `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. It does not affect the values of any variables. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\)**
