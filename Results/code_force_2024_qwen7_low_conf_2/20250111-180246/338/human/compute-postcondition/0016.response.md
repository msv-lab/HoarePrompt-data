The code snippet reads three integers from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be replaced by the input values. The variables `t`, `i`, and `max_color` are not affected by this operation.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged).
2. `i` is 2 (unchanged).
3. `n` is assigned the value of the first input integer.
4. `m` is assigned the value of the second input integer.
5. `k` is assigned the value of the third input integer.
6. `max_color` is initially defined as \((n + m - 1) / m\). After assigning new values to `n` and `m`, `max_color` will be recalculated using the new values of `n` and `m`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((\text{new } n + \text{new } m - 1) / \text{new } m\)**
