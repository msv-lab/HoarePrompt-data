Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\). If `max_color + k >= n`, the print statement outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `max_color` remain unchanged.***
