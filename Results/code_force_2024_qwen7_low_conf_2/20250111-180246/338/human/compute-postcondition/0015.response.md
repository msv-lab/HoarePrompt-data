According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Given that `i` starts from 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `t` must be greater than 0 and greater than the current value of `i` (which is 1), `t` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` remains greater than 0
- `i` is incremented to 2
- `n` is the first input integer (unchanged)
- `m` is the second input integer (unchanged)
- `k` is the third input integer (unchanged)
- `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\) (unchanged)

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\)**
