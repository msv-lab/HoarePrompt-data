Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is the last index value of the loop (i.e., `t-1`), `n`, `m`, and `k` are the last input integers provided, `max_color` is set to \((n + m - 1) / m\). If `max_color + k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then 'NO' is printed for the last iteration. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed for the last iteration.**
