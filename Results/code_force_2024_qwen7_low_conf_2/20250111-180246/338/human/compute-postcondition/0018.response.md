The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `max_color`. The only change is the printed output.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `max_color` is \((n + m - 1) / m\), and the output is 'NO'**
