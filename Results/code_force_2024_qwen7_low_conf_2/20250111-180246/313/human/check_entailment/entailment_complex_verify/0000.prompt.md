You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is the last value returned by `R()`, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and the sum of reductions ensures no further operations are possible, `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`, and the output is `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, the function performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a`.
3. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the list `a` respectively.
4. It enters a loop that continues as long as `i < j` and the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` is greater than 0. Within this loop, it:
   - Decrements `k` by twice the value of `m`, where `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
   - Decrements `a[i]` by `m` and advances `i` to the next position if `a[i]` becomes less than 1.
   - Decrements `a[j]` by `m` and retreats `j` to the previous position if `a[j]` becomes less than 1.
5. After exiting the loop, it prints the result calculated as `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that reads input and splits it into integers, `n` is the last value read from the input, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and no further operations are possible, and `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the attack sequence of the Kraken. Specifically, the program does not accurately handle the alternating pattern of attacking the first and last ships. Instead of decrementing the durability of the first and last ships in an alternating manner until they sink, the program attempts to decrement the durability of both the first and last ships simultaneously within a single iteration of the loop, which is not correct according to the problem description.

To illustrate this issue, consider the following input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

According to the problem description, the sequence of attacks should be as follows:
1. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 0), a = [2, 4, 3]
2. Attack the last ship (durability becomes 2), a = [2, 4, 2]
3. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 1), a = [1, 4, 2]
4. Attack the last ship (durability becomes 1), a = [1, 4, 1]
5. Attack the first ship (durability becomes 0), a = [4, 1]

However, the program incorrectly handles the durability decrement, leading to an incorrect result. For instance, in the first iteration, the program subtracts from both the first and last ship, which does not accurately reflect the described attack sequence.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly implement the specified attack pattern, hence it is incorrect.
