You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

# Execution Summary:
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, the function performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a`.
3. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the list `a` respectively.
4. It enters a loop that continues as long as `i < j` and the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` is greater than 0. Within this loop, it:
   - Decrements `k` by twice the value of `m`, where `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
   - Decrements `a[i]` by `m` and advances `i` to the next position if `a[i]` becomes less than 1.
   - Decrements `a[j]` by `m` and retreats `j` to the previous position if `a[j]` becomes less than 1.
5. After exiting the loop, it prints the result calculated as `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that reads input and splits it into integers, `n` is the last value read from the input, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and no further operations are possible, and `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`.
