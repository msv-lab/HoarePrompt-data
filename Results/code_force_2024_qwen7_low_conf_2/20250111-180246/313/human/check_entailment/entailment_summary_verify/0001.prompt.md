You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = R()
        (*a,) = R()
        i = 0
        j = n - 1
        while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
            k -= m * 2
            a[i] -= m
            i += a[i] < 1
            a[j] -= m
            j -= a[j] < 1
        print(i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, the function performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a`.
3. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the list `a` respectively.
4. It enters a loop that continues as long as `i < j` and the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` is greater than 0. Within this loop, it:
   - Decrements `k` by twice the value of `m`, where `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
   - Decrements `a[i]` by `m` and advances `i` to the next position if `a[i]` becomes less than 1.
   - Decrements `a[j]` by `m` and retreats `j` to the previous position if `a[j]` becomes less than 1.
5. After exiting the loop, it prints the result calculated as `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that reads input and splits it into integers, `n` is the last value read from the input, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and no further operations are possible, and `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step against the problem description.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The program initializes variables `i` and `j` to track the first and last ship indices, respectively. It also correctly initializes the list `a` with the durabilities of the ships.
3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The loop continues until either `i` equals `j` or there are no more attacks left (`k` is less than the minimum durability of the current first and last ships).
   - In each iteration, the program reduces the durability of the first and last ships by the same amount `m`, where `m` is the minimum of the durabilities of the first and last ships and half of the remaining attacks (`k // 2`).
   - After reducing the durability, it updates the indices `i` and `j` based on whether the current ship has sunk.
4. **Output Calculation**:
   - After exiting the loop, the program calculates the number of ships that have sunk. This calculation is based on the remaining index values and the remaining attacks on the central ship if it hasn't sunk.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the program logic matches the problem requirements. It correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and calculates the number of sunk ships accurately.
