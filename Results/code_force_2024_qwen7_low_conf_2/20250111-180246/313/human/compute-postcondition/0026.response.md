To determine the final state of the variables after the while loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step by step and generalize the behavior based on the provided outputs.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is \(t - 1\)
   - `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces
   - `n` is an integer from input
   - `k` is an integer from input
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is `n - 1`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < j` and `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - `k -= m * 2`
   - `a[i] -= m`
   - `i += a[i] < 1`
   - `a[j] -= m`
   - `j -= a[j] < 1`

### Observations from Given Outputs

- **First Iteration**:
  - `t` remains `t - 1`
  - `R` remains unchanged
  - `k` decreases by `m * 2`
  - `a` is modified such that the last element is decreased by `m`
  - `i` is updated based on `a[i] < 1`
  - `j` is updated based on `a[j] < 1`

- **Second Iteration**:
  - `t` remains `t - 1`
  - `R` remains unchanged
  - `k` decreases by `2 * m`
  - `a` is further modified with the last element being decreased by `m`
  - `i` and `j` are updated based on conditions

- **Third Iteration**:
  - `k` decreases by `m * 2`
  - `a[j]` is updated by subtracting `m` if `a[j] < 1`
  - `j` is updated if `a[j] < 1`
  - `i` is updated if `a[i] < 1`

### Generalization

From the observations, we can infer the following:
- `t` will always be `t - 1` since it is initialized as `t - 1` and does not change inside the loop.
- `R` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- `k` is decreased by `m * 2` each iteration until the condition `i < j` is no longer satisfied.
- `a` is modified in each iteration, and the last element is continuously decreased by `m`.
- `i` and `j` are updated based on the conditions `a[i] < 1` and `a[j] < 1`.

### Final State

After the loop completes, the variables will be in the following states:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces
- `n` remains unchanged
- `k` is reduced to a non-positive value (since `k` keeps decreasing by `m * 2` and `m` is non-zero).
- `a` is a list of integers where the last element is eventually zero or negative, and other elements are also reduced accordingly.
- `i` and `j` will be such that either `i = j` or `i > j` depending on the final values of `a[i]` and `a[j]`.

### Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is unchanged, `k` is a non-positive value, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is zero or negative and other elements are reduced, `i` and `j` are such that either `i = j` or `i > j`.**
