The code `lit.pop()` removes and returns the last element of the deque `lit`. Since `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, after removing the last element, `lit` will either be empty or a deque with one less element than before.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is `n - u`
- `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers
- `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed
- `sunk` is 3
- `u` is `lit[lastState]` (where `lit[lastState]` is either `None` if `lit` is empty or the first or last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty)
- `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)

After `lit.pop()`:
- `lit` will lose its last element, which means if it was not empty, it will now be empty or have one less element.
- `u` will be updated to the new value of `lit[lastState]`.

If `lit` was originally an empty deque, after popping, it will remain empty and `u` will remain unchanged.

If `lit` was originally a deque with the last element removed, after popping, it will become an empty deque and `u` will also remain unchanged because `lit` had no elements left to pop.

In both cases, `u` will be `None` since `lit` is now empty.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is 3, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)**.
