Let's analyze the given conditions step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Conditions:
1. `k` is its original value.
2. `a[j]` is `a[j] - 2m`.
3. `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2m`.
4. `i` is increased by 1 if `a[i]_initial - 3m < 1`.
5. At least one of `a[0]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` is non-zero.
6. `j` is `j - 1` if `a[j] < 1` and `j` otherwise.
7. `i < j`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop continues as long as:
- `i < j`
- `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)`

### Analysis:

1. **Condition `i < j`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i < j` must hold true for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)`**:
   - For the assignment `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` to hold true in the next iteration, at least one of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` must be non-zero (as stated in condition 5).

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- **`i < j`**: This condition must remain true for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` has not reached `j` yet.
- **At least one of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` must be non-zero**: Since `k` is its original value and assuming `k // 2` is non-zero (it is typically an integer division), we need to ensure that either `a[i]` or `a[j]` is non-zero.

### Adjusted States:
- `k` remains unchanged as it is its original value.
- `a[j]` is `a[j] - 2m`, and for the loop to continue, `a[j]` must be non-zero (since `a[j]` was modified by subtracting `2m`).
- `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2m`, and for the loop to continue, `a[i]` must be non-zero (since `a[i]` was modified by subtracting `2m`).
- `i < j` must hold true.

### Conclusion:
State: **`k` is its original value, `a[j]` is `a[j] - 2m` and must be non-zero, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2m` and must be non-zero, and `i < j`**.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`k` is its original value, `a[j]` is `a[j] - 2m` and must be non-zero, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2m` and must be non-zero, and `i < j`**.
