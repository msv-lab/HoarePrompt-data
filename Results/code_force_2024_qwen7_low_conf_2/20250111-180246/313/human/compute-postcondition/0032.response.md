The code `i = 0` assigns the value `0` to the variable `i`. The value of `i` was previously unchanged, and now it is explicitly set to `0`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `n`, `k`, `j`, `t`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is updated with the new list of integers from `R()`, `n` is `a`, `k` is `b`, `i` is `0`, `j` remains unchanged, `t` is `t - 1`.**
