`sunk` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input minus `u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the first element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`. If `lastState` is 0, `lastState` remains 0. If `lastState` is -1, `lastState` remains -1.**
