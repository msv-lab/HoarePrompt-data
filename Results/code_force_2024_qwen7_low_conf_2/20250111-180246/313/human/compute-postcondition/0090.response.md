Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The given loop is a `while True` loop. This means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no exit conditions defined within the loop itself. Therefore, we don't need to adjust any states related to the loop condition; the loop will always proceed to the next iteration.

2. **Current States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is the first integer input
   - `k` is `n - u`
   - `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers
   - `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed
   - `sunk` is 2
   - `u` is `None`
   - `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)

3. **Next Iteration Requirements**: Since the loop is `while True`, it will always proceed to the next iteration regardless of the current states. There are no constraints or conditions inside the loop that would prevent it from executing another iteration.

4. **No Adjustment Needed**: Since the loop will always execute another iteration due to `while True`, no states need to be adjusted. All the states remain as they are after the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration is sufficient for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

**State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)**
