Postcondition: ***`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, and an IndexError has occurred. This holds true regardless of whether `u` is less than or equal to `k` or not, since there is no else part provided and the postcondition of the if part directly follows from the if condition.***
