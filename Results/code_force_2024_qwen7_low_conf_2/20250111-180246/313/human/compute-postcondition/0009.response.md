The code subtracts `m * 2` from `k`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `m`, we only know that `k` is decreased by twice the value of `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\), `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is decreased by `m * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
