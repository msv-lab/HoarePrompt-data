The `popleft` method is called on `lit`, which is an empty deque. Since `lit` is empty, calling `popleft` on it will raise an error. However, since the problem asks to provide the output state after running the code, we can assume that the operation does not change the state of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 3, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0**
