`sunk` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `sunk` was 1, so now `sunk` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and we encounter an error due to accessing an element from an empty deque.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and we encounter an error due to accessing an element from an empty deque.**
