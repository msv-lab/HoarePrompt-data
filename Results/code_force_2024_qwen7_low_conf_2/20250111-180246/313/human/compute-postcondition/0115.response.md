`lastState` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `t` is 1 less than its previous value, `sunk` remains `0`, `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, and the current value of `lastState` changes from `-1` to `0`. 

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is 0, `sunk` is 0, `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0**
