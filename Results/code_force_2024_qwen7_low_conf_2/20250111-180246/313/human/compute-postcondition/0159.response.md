Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), followed by pairs of integers \( n \) and \( k \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{15} \)), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \) (where \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \)). For each test case, it uses a deque to process the list of integers and counts how many of them can be subtracted from \( k \) without making \( k \) negative. It then prints the count for each test case. The function terminates after processing all test cases. Potential edge cases include when \( t = 0 \) (no test cases to process), or when the input list is empty or \( k \) becomes zero before processing all elements. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.**
