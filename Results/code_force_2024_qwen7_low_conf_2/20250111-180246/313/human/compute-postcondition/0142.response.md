According to the code, this is a `while True` loop, meaning the loop will definitely execute at least one more time regardless of the current state of the variables.

At the end of the last iteration, the state is as follows:
- `t` is 0
- `lastState` is either 0 or -1
- `sunk` is 2
- `lit` is an empty deque
- `k` is 0
- An error occurred due to accessing an element from an empty deque

Since this is a `while True` loop, no adjustments to the state are necessary to ensure the loop executes again. The loop will continue to run indefinitely.

State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0**
