`k` is decremented by `u`. The initial state specifies that `t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, and an IndexError has occurred. Since the decrement operation directly affects `k`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and an IndexError has occurred.**
