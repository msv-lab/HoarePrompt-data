The code assigns the value of `lit[lastState]` to `u`. Here, `lastState` can be either 0 or -1. 

- If `lastState` is 0, `u` gets the value of the first element in `lit`. However, since `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the first element removed, the first element in `lit` is `None` if `lit` is empty.
- If `lastState` is -1, `u` gets the last element in `lit`, which would be `None` if `lit` is empty.

Therefore, `u` will be `None` in both cases because `lit` cannot contain any actual elements due to the conditions mentioned. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input minus `u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the first element removed, `sunk` is 1, `u` is `None`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`. If `lastState` is 0, `lastState` remains 0. If `lastState` is -1, `lastState` remains -1.**
