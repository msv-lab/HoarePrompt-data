The code `break` does not assign any new values to variables; instead, it exits the current loop or match statement. Since no such construct is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 0, `lit` is an empty deque, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. Either the length of `lit` is 0 or `k` is less than or equal to 0.**
