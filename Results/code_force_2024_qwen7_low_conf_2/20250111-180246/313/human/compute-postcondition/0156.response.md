The code prints the value of `sunk`. Since `sunk` is equal to the length of the initial `lit` deque and `lit` is an empty deque, the length of `lit` is 0. Therefore, `sunk` is 0.

After executing the code, the value of `sunk` is printed, but its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `lastState`, `lit`, `k`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 0, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0 or less, and an IndexError has occurred.**
