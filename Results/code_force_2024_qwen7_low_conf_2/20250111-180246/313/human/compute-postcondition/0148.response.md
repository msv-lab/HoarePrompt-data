The code `u = lit[lastState]` tries to assign the value at `lastState` index in the deque `lit` to the variable `u`. However, the initial state specifies that `lit` is an empty deque. An empty deque does not have any elements, so attempting to access an index from it will raise an `IndexError`. Since no valid value can be assigned to `u` due to this error, the state of the program is altered by the exception.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0, and an IndexError is raised attempting to access an element in an empty deque.**
