The code `lastState = 0` updates the value of `lastState` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state specifies that `lastState` is either 0 or -1, but after executing the code, `lastState` is explicitly set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is 0, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
