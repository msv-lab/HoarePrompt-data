The code snippet `a[i] -= m` updates the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `m` from its current value. Here's the step-by-step impact:

1. `a[i]` is updated by subtracting `m`. The previous value of `a[i]` is `a[0] - m` (from the initial state).
2. `j` remains unchanged and is still `n - 1`.
3. `k` remains unchanged and is still the original value of `k` minus `4 * m`.
4. `m` remains unchanged and is still the minimum value among `a[0] - m`, `a[n - 1]`, and `k // 2`.
5. `t` remains unchanged and is still `t - 1`.
6. `n` remains unchanged and is still a value from `R()`.
7. `i` remains unchanged and is still updated by adding 1 if `a[i] < 1` is true, but this condition does not affect the value of `i` since no new assignment is made to `i` in the given code snippet.
8. `a[n - 1]` remains unchanged and is still decreased by `m`.

Since the value of `a[i]` is now `a[0] - m - m = a[0] - 2m`, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`a[0]` is `a[0] - m`, `j` is `n - 1`, `k` is the original value of `k` minus `4 * m`, `m` is the minimum value among `a[0] - m`, `a[n - 1]`, and `k // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a value from `R()`, `i` is updated by adding 1 if `a[i] < 1` is true, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `m`, `a[i]` is `a[0] - 2m`**.
