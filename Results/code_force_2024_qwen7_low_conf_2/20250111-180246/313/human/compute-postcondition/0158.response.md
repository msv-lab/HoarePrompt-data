The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
- `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
- It also accepts a list of `n` integers `a` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

Based on the given cases, the function returns either an error message if the input is invalid or a specific result based on the input parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes these inputs according to certain rules and returns a result or an error message depending on the validation and processing outcomes.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function returns a result or an error message based on the validation and processing of these inputs.**
