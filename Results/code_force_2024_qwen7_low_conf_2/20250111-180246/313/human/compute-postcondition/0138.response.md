The code `lit.popleft()` attempts to remove and return the leftmost item from the deque `lit`. However, since `lit` is an empty deque, this operation will raise an error. Given that the precondition includes the occurrence of an error when accessing an element from an empty deque, the operation cannot proceed. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and we encounter an error due to accessing an element from an empty deque.**
