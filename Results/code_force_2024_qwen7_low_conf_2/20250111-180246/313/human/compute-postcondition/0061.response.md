`k` is decremented by `2 * m`. The value of `m` is the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`. Since `a[i]` and `a[j]` are reduced by `m` in each iteration and will be zero if they were smaller than `m`, and `k` and `a[i]` and `a[j]` must be valid for the next iteration, the exact value of `m` depends on the current values of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.

The other variables (`i`, `j`, `t`, `n`, `a[i]`, `a[j]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `k` is the original value of `k` minus `2 * m`, where `m` is the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are reduced by `m` in each iteration and will be zero if they were smaller than `m`, `k` and `a[i]` and `a[j]` must be valid for the next iteration, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is a value from `R()`**
