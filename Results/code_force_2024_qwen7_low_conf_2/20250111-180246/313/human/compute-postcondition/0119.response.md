The code `u = lit[lastState]` accesses an element from the deque `lit` using the index `lastState`. 

- If `lastState` is 0, and `lit` is an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, then an exception (IndexError) will be raised because there is no element at index 0 in an empty deque.
- If `lastState` is -1, and `lit` is an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, then an exception (IndexError) will be raised because there is no element at index -1 in an empty deque.

Since the initial state specifies that `lastState` is either 0 or -1, and `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, in both cases, an IndexError will be raised, and the value of `u` will not be assigned.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 0, `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, and an IndexError has occurred.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 0, `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, and an IndexError has occurred.**
