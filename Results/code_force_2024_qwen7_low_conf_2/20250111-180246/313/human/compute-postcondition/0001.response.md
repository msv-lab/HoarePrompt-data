`t` is assigned the value returned by the lambda function `R()`, which splits the input into a tuple of integers. Since `t` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. The other variables (`R`, `n`, `k`, `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\); `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
