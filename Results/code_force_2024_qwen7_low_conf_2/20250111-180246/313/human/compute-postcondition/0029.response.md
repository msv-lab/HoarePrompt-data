`t` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `t - 1`. The values of `R`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is unchanged, `k` is a non-positive value, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is zero or negative and other elements are reduced, `i` and `j` are such that either `i = j` or `i > j`, and the output is `i + n - j - 1`**
