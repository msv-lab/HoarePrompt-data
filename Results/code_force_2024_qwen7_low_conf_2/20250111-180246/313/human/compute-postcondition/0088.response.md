Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input minus `u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1). If `u <= k` is true, `lit` is a deque with the last element removed. If `u <= k` is false, `lit` loses its leftmost element.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else cases, ensuring that the conditions specified in both parts are accounted for, and the state of the variables is described accurately after the execution of the if-else block.
