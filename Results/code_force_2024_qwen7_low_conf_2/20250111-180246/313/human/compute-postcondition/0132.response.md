`lastState` is assigned the value 0. The value of `t` is 1 less than its previous value, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is 0, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
