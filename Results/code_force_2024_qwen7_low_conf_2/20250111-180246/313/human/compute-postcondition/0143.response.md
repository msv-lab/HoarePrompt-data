The code `break` does not change any variable values and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the only effect is to indicate that we exit the most internal loop or conditional statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**
