`lit` is a deque, and `popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque. Since `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, and an IndexError has occurred, it implies that `lit` was an empty deque. Removing from an empty deque raises an IndexError, so the state of `lit` remains unchanged (empty), and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is 0, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, and an IndexError has occurred.**
