Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given States:
- \( k \) is its original value minus \( 2 \times m \)
- \( a[j] \) is \( a[j] - m \)
- \( i \) is increased by 1 if \( a[i] - m < 1 \)
- At least one of \( a[0] \), \( a[j] \), or \( k // 2 \) is non-zero
- \( j \) is decremented by 1 if \( a[j] < 1 \)

### Loop Condition:
\[ \text{while } i < j \text{ and } (m := \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)): \]

### Analysis:

1. **Condition \( i < j \):**
   - For the loop to continue, \( i \) must be less than \( j \).

2. **Condition \( (m := \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)) \):**
   - The loop continues as long as the minimum of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), and \( k // 2 \) is non-zero.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:
- \( k = \text{original value} - 2 \times m \)
- \( a[j] = a[j] - m \)
- \( i \) is increased by 1 if \( a[i] - m < 1 \)
- At least one of \( a[0] \), \( a[j] \), or \( k // 2 \) is non-zero
- \( j \) is decremented by 1 if \( a[j] < 1 \)

### Requirements for the Next Iteration:
1. **Ensure \( i < j \):**
   - If \( i \geq j \), the loop cannot continue. We need to ensure \( i < j \).

2. **Ensure \( \min(a[i], a[j], k // 2) \neq 0 \):**
   - At least one of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), or \( k // 2 \) must be non-zero for the loop to continue.

### Adjustments Needed:
1. **If \( i \geq j \):**
   - This means the loop has already terminated in the previous iteration. To continue, we need to adjust \( i \) and/or \( j \) such that \( i < j \).

2. **Ensure Non-Zero Minimum:**
   - Ensure at least one of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), or \( k // 2 \) is non-zero.

Given these conditions, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure \( i < j \) and at least one of \( a[i] \), \( a[j] \), or \( k // 2 \) is non-zero.

### Final Answer:
State: **`k` is its original value minus \( 2 \times m \), \( a[j] \) is \( a[j] - m \), \( i \) is increased by 1 if \( a[i] - m < 1 \), at least one of \( a[0] \), \( a[j] \), or \( k // 2 \) is non-zero, \( j \) is decremented by 1 if \( a[j] < 1 \), and \( i < j \)**.
