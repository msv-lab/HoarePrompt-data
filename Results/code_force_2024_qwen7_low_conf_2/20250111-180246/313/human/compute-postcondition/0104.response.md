The code `print(sunk)` prints the value of the variable `sunk`. This does not change the value of `sunk`, nor does it affect any other variables. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the remaining value after processing all valid `u` values, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is the total number of valid `u` values processed, `lastState` is -1 or 0, and `u` is `None`. The value of `sunk` is printed.**
