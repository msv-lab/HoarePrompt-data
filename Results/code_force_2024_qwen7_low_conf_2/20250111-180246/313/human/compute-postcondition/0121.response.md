`sunk` is incremented by 1. The value of `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` was originally 0, so now it is 1. The state of `t`, `lit`, and the condition of `u` being less than or equal to `k` remain unchanged. The occurrence of an IndexError is also not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, and an IndexError has occurred.**
