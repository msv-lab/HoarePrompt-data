The code `k -= u` subtracts the value of `u` from `k`. Since the initial value of `k` is 0, and we don't know the value of `u`, the new value of `k` will be `-u`. The states of the other variables (`t`, `lastState`, `sunk`, `lit`, and `u`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is -u**
