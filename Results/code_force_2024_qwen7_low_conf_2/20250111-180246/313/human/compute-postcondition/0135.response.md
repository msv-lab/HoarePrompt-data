`u` is assigned the value of `lit[lastState]`. Given that `lastState` is either 0 or -1, and `lit` is an empty deque, attempting to access an element from an empty deque will result in an error. However, since the problem asks to update the state based on the code execution, we'll consider the state post-execution. 

Since `lit` is empty, accessing `lit[lastState]` will not assign a value to `u`, leading to an error or undefined behavior. Nevertheless, following the instruction to provide the updated state:

- `t` is 1 less than its previous value.
- `lastState` is either 0 or -1 (unchanged).
- `sunk` remains 1.
- `lit` remains an empty deque.
- `k` is decreased by `u` (but `u` is not defined, so no specific value can be assigned).

Given the nature of the code and the initial state, the output state would reflect the unchanged values of `lastState`, `sunk`, `lit`, and `k` (decreased by `u`), and the updated value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and we encounter an error due to accessing an element from an empty deque.**
