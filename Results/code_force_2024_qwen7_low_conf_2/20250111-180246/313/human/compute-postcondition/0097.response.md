`sunk` is incremented by 1. The value of `sunk` was initially 2, so now it is 3. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 3, `u` is `lit[lastState]` (where `lit[lastState]` is either `None` if `lit` is empty or the first or last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty), and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)**
