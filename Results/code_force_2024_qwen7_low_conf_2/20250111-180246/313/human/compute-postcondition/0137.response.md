The code `lit.pop()` attempts to pop an element from the deque `lit`. However, since `lit` is an empty deque, this operation raises an error. Given that the initial state includes the information about `lit` being an empty deque, the operation cannot proceed without causing an error. Therefore, the output state will include the fact that an error occurred.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and we encounter an error due to accessing an element from an empty deque during the `pop` operation.**
