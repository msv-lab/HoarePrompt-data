The value of `k` is decremented by `2m`. The values of `a[j]` and `a[i]` remain unchanged and must still be non-zero. The condition `i < j` remains valid. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`k` is its original value minus 2m, `a[j]` is `a[j] - 2m` and must be non-zero, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 2m` and must be non-zero, and `i < j`**
