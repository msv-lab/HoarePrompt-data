Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the remaining value after processing all valid `u` values.
   - `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers.
   - `lit` is an empty deque.
   - `sunk` is the total number of valid `u` values processed.
   - `lastState` is -1 or 0.
   - `u` is `None`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `t` iterations.

3. **Key Variables to Adjust**:
   - `t`: This is the counter for the number of iterations left. Since we are starting a new iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1.
   - `lastState`: This variable is updated based on the outcome of each iteration. It can either be -1 or 0.
   - `sunk`: This is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in each iteration.

4. **State After One Iteration**:
   - `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - `lastState` will be updated based on the loop body (which is omitted but must result in either -1 or 0).
   - `sunk` will be updated based on the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `t` will be reduced by 1 since one iteration is completed.
- `lastState` will be set to either -1 or 0 depending on the outcome of the loop body.
- `sunk` will be updated by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1 or 0, and `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration**. 

Since the exact value of `t` is not provided, we will represent it as `t - 1`.

Final State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1 or 0, and `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration**.

To represent it clearly:
State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1 or 0, and `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration**.
