The code sets `lastState` to `-1`. This changes the value of `lastState` but does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is 1 less than its previous value; `lastState` is `-1`; `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration; `lit` is a deque initialized with integers input from the user; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value; `lastState` is -1; `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration; `lit` is a deque initialized with integers input from the user; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer**
