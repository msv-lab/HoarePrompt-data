The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. However, since no specific values are provided for these inputs, we will represent them as generic integers. The values of `t`, `lastState`, and `sunk` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1 or 0, `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
