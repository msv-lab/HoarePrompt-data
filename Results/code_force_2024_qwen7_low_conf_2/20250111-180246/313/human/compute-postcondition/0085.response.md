`lit` is a deque that can either be empty or have the first element removed. The code `lit.pop()` removes the last element from `lit`. Since `lit` is a deque, removing the last element affects its structure. The precondition also mentions that if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but since `lit.pop()` is executed, it means `len(lit) != 0` and `k > 0`.

Therefore, after executing `lit.pop()`, the last element of `lit` is removed.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input minus `u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`. If `lastState` is 0, `lastState` remains 0. If `lastState` is -1, `lastState` remains -1.**
