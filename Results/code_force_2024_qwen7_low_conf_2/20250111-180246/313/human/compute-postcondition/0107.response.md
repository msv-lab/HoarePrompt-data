The code initializes a deque (`lit`) with integers input from the user. The previous values of the affected variables are:

- `t` is 1 less than its previous value
- `lastState` is -1 or 0
- `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer

After executing the code, the values of the variables that have been changed are:

- `lit` is a deque initialized with integers input from the user
- `t` is 1 less than its previous value
- `lastState` remains unchanged (it could be -1 or 0)
- `sunk` remains unchanged (it is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration, but since no `u` values are mentioned, it is assumed to remain as it was before)
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value; `lastState` is -1 or 0; `sunk` is incremented by the number of valid `u` values processed in this iteration; `lit` is a deque initialized with integers input from the user; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer**
