Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer processed, `k` is the final remaining value after processing all valid `u` values, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is the total number of valid `u` values processed, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, and `u` is `None`.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial Values and Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the initial number of test cases.
   - Each iteration processes a new set of inputs `n` and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a`.

2. **Variable State After Processing**:
   - Once `t` iterations are completed, `t` becomes 0 because each iteration decreases `t` by 1 until it reaches 0.
   - `n` is the last `n` value processed in any of the iterations.
   - `k` is the final remaining value after processing all valid `u` values (`u` is an element from the deque `lit`) in the last iteration.
   - `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, where `n` is the last `n` value processed.
   - `lit` is an empty deque after all elements are processed.
   - `sunk` is the total number of valid `u` values processed across all iterations.
   - `lastState` is either 0 or -1, depending on the last operation performed (whether the element was popped from the end or the front of the deque).
   - `u` is `None` because `lit` is empty.

This state reflects the final conditions of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.
