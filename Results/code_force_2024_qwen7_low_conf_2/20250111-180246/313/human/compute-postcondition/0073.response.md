The value of `k` is decreased by `2 * m`. The initial state of `a[0] - m` being non-negative, `a[n - 1]` being non-negative, `k // 2` being non-negative, `a[j]` being non-zero or `a[j] >= 1`, and `i < j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[0] - m` is non-negative, `a[n - 1]` is non-negative, `k // 2` is non-negative, `a[j]` is non-zero or `a[j] >= 1`, `i < j`, and `k` is decreased by `2 * m`.

Output State: **`a[0] - m` is non-negative, `a[n - 1]` is non-negative, `k // 2` is non-negative, `a[j]` is non-zero or `a[j] >= 1`, `i < j`, `k` is decreased by `2 * m`**
