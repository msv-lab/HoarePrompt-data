The code `u = lit[lastState]` assigns the value of `lit[lastState]` to the variable `u`. Given the initial state, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, and `lastState` is either 0 or -1. 

- If `lastState` is 0, `lit[0]` will be the first element in `lit` (if `lit` is not empty).
- If `lastState` is -1, `lit[-1]` will be the last element in `lit` (if `lit` is not empty).

Since `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `lit` cannot have more than one element. Let's consider both cases:

1. If `lit` is empty, `lit[lastState]` is undefined (or `None`), so `u` will be `None`.
2. If `lit` is not empty, `lit[lastState]` will be the first or last element of `lit`, depending on whether `lastState` is 0 or -1.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is `n - u`
- `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers
- `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed
- `sunk` is 2
- `u` is now the value of `lit[lastState]` (which could be `None` if `lit` is empty, or the first or last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty)
- `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `lit[lastState]` (where `lit[lastState]` is either `None` if `lit` is empty or the first or last element of `lit` if `lit` is not empty), and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)**.
