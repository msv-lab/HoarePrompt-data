The initial state is that `k` is decreased by `m * 2`. The code snippet `a[i] -= m` updates the value of `a[i]` by subtracting `m` from it. However, the initial values of `a`, `i`, and `m` are not specified in the initial state.

Given the lack of specific initial values for `a`, `i`, and `m`, the best we can do is express the updated value of `a[i]` in terms of these variables. 

The code `a[i] -= m` can be rewritten as `a[i] = a[i] - m`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`k` is decreased by `m * 2`, `a[i]` is `a[i] - m`**
