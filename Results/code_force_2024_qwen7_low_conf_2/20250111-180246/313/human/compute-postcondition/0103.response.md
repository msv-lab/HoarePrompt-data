Let's analyze the loop step by step and determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0
   - `n` is the first integer input
   - `k` is the second integer input
   - `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers
   - `lit` is a deque of integers split from the second input
   - `lastState` is -1
   - `sunk` is 0
   - `u` is not defined

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `len(lit) != 0` and `k > 0`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `lastState` is -1, set `lastState` to 0.
     - Otherwise, set `lastState` to -1.
     - Assign the appropriate element from `lit` to `u` (first or last element based on `lastState`).
     - If `u <= k`, increment `sunk` by 1 and remove the appropriate element from `lit` (last element if `lastState` is -1, first element otherwise).
     - Decrease `k` by `u`.

3. **Output State After Multiple Iterations:**
   - From the provided states, we observe that:
     - `sunk` increases by 1 each time the loop iterates and eventually reaches a final value.
     - `k` decreases by the value of `u` each iteration.
     - `lit` is reduced by removing elements based on the `lastState`.
     - `lastState` alternates between -1 and 0, indicating whether the element being processed is from the end or the start of the deque.

4. **Final Loop Condition:**
   - The loop exits when `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`.

5. **Final Values:**
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the loop.
   - `k` will be the remaining value after all valid `u` values are subtracted from it.
   - `a` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the loop.
   - `lit` will be an empty deque or a deque with all elements removed.
   - `sunk` will be the total number of valid `u` values processed.
   - `lastState` will be -1 or 0 depending on the last valid element processed.
   - `u` will be `None` since the loop terminates and `u` is not redefined after the loop.

### Final Output State:

Given the loop conditions and the provided examples, the final state after the loop has executed is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the remaining value after processing all valid `u` values, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is an empty deque, `sunk` is the total number of valid `u` values processed, `lastState` is -1 or 0, and `u` is `None`.**
