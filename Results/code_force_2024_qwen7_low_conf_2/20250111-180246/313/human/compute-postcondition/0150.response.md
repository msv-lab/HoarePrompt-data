`lit` is a deque, and the code attempts to pop an element from it. However, since `lit` is an empty deque, popping an element from it will result in a `IndexError`. No changes are made to the variables due to this error. The output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 3, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0**
