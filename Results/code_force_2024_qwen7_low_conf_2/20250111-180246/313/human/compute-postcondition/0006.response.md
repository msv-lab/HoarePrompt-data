`i` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `t` is updated to \(t - 1\), `R` remains a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` remains an integer from input, `k` remains an integer from input, and `a` remains a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\), `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `i` is 0**
