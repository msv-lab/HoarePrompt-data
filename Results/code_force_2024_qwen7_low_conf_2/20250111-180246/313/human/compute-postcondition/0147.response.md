Postcondition: ***`t` is 0, `lastState` is either 0 or -1, `sunk` is 2, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.***

Explanation: The if-else block ensures that `lastState` is set to either 0 or -1, depending on the condition. The other variables (`t`, `sunk`, `lit`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are the same in both the if and else parts of the condition. Therefore, the overall postcondition combines both cases, stating that `lastState` can be either 0 or -1 while the other variables maintain their initial states.
