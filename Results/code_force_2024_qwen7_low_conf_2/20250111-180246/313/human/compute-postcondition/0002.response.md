Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces.
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `t` is given to be a positive integer within the specified range, it is already in a state where it can potentially be non-zero.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is necessary to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

Based on this analysis, the current state before the loop is sufficient for the loop to proceed.

**Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\); `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
