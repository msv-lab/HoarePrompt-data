The code `lastState = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `lastState`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated values are as follows:

- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the first integer input
- `k` is `n - u`
- `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers
- `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed
- `sunk` is 2
- `u` is `None`
- `lastState` is 0 (changed from its original state)

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, `lastState` is 0**
