`t` is decremented by 1. The value of `i` being equal to `j` or `i` being greater than or equal to `j`, `j` being the last index where the loop could potentially operate, and the relationships involving `k`, `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `j` or `i` is greater than or equal to `j`, `j` is the last index where the loop could potentially operate, `k` is the original value of `k` minus a multiple of `2m`, where `m` is the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` during each iteration, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are reduced by `m` in each iteration and will be zero if they were smaller than `m`, and `k` and `a[i]` and `a[j]` must be valid for the next iteration; `t` is decreased by 1.**
