According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute at least once. Since the loop is guaranteed to execute, no adjustments to the states are necessary.

State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value; `lastState` is -1; `sunk` is 0; `lit` is a deque initialized with integers input from the user; `n` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer**
