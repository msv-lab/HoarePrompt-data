`j` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is \(t - 1\), `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`.
