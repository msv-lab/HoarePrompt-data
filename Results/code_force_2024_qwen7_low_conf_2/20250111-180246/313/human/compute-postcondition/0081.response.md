The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but likely uses a list of test cases internally, where each test case contains a positive integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. The function processes each test case according to the given constraints.

For each test case, if `t` is within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `n` is within the range 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is within the range 1 to \(10^{15}\), and the sum of all elements in list `a` does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), the function performs some operation (not specified here). Based on the operations and conditions, the function returns a specific value or result for each test case.

Given the information provided, the function's output is dependent on the internal processing of the test cases and the results of operations performed on `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a set of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each valid test case, the function performs certain operations and returns a result based on the input values.**
