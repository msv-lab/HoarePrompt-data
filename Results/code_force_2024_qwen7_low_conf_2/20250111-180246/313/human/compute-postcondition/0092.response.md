Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1). If `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`, the condition is met and no further changes occur.***
