The code `lastState = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `lastState`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `lastState`.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, `k` is decreased by `u`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
