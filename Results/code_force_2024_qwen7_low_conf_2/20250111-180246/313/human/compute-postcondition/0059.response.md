The code snippet `j = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to `j`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `k` is the original value of `k` minus a multiple of `2m`, where `m` is the minimum value among `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` during each iteration, `a[i]` and `a[j]` are reduced by `m` in each iteration and will be zero if they were smaller than `m`, `k` and `a[i]` and `a[j]` must be valid for the next iteration, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` and `k` are values from `R()`**
