Let's break down the given information and the conditions of the `while` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted.

### Given Information:
- `t` is updated as `t - 1` in the previous iteration.
- `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces.
- `n` is an integer from input.
- `k` is decreased by `m * 2`.
- `a` is a list of integers where the last element is decreased by `m`.
- `i` is 1 if `a[0] < 1` or 0 otherwise.
- `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `a[n-2] < 1`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < j and (m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition Components:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i < j` and `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))` evaluates to a non-zero value.
   - For the assignment part `(m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2))` to evaluate to a non-zero value, `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)` must be a positive integer.

2. **Variables to Adjust:**
   - `i`: Must be less than `j`.
   - `j`: Must be greater than `i`.
   - `m`: Must be a positive integer (since `m := min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)`).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

#### 1. Adjusting `i` and `j`:
- From the problem statement, `i` is determined by `a[0]` and `j` is determined by `a[n-2]`.
- For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `j`. We need to ensure that this condition holds.

#### 2. Adjusting `m`:
- `m` is derived from `min(a[i], a[j], k // 2)`. For `m` to be positive, at least one of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` must be positive.
- Since `k` is decreasing by `m * 2`, we need to ensure that `k` remains large enough such that `k // 2` is positive.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
- `i` should be less than `j`.
- `j` should be greater than `i`.
- `m` should be a positive integer, meaning at least one of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, or `k // 2` should be positive.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is an integer from input, `k` must be large enough such that `k // 2` is positive, `a` is a list of integers where the last element is decreased by `m`, `i` is 1 if `a[0] < 1` or 0 otherwise, `j` is either `n-1` or `n-2` depending on whether `a[n-2] < 1` and `i < j`.**
