The code `lit.popleft()` removes the leftmost element from the deque `lit`. Given the initial state, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed. If `lit` is already empty, attempting to remove an element from it will leave it unchanged. If `lit` is not empty, removing the leftmost element will adjust its contents.

Let's consider both cases:

1. **If `lit` is not empty:**
   - `lit` is a deque with the last element removed, and `u` is set to `lit[lastState]`.
   - After `lit.popleft()`, the leftmost element is removed.
   - Since `u` is derived from the last element of `lit` (if `lit` was not empty initially), `u` will now be `None` because `lit` is now empty or has fewer elements, making the reference to the last element invalid.
   
2. **If `lit` is already empty:**
   - `lit.popleft()` will leave `lit` unchanged because there are no elements to remove.
   - In this case, `u` remains unchanged and is still `None`.

In both cases, `u` will be `None` after the operation. The other variables remain unchanged in their respective states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the next-to-last element removed, `sunk` is 3, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1)**
