Output State: **`t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is the last value returned by `R()`, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and the sum of reductions ensures no further operations are possible, `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`, and the output is `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`**
