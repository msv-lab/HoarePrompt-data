`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and it is decremented by 1. The value of `t` is now \(t - 1\). The states of the other variables (`R`, `n`, `k`, and `a`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\), `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)**
