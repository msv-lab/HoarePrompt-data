The code snippet `*a, = R()` unpacks the result of calling the lambda function `R()` into the list `a`. The lambda function `R()` returns a tuple of integers obtained by splitting input on spaces. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is \(t - 1\)
- `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces
- `n` is an integer from input
- `k` is an integer from input
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)

After executing the code snippet, the tuple returned by `R()` will be unpacked into the list `a`. Therefore, `a` will now contain the integers obtained from the input split by spaces. The values of `t`, `R`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is \(t - 1\), `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces**
