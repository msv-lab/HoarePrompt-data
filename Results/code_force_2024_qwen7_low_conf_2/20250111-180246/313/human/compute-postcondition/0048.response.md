`a[i]` is decremented by `m`. Initially, `a[i]` was `a[i] - 2m`, so after decrementing by `m`, the new value of `a[i]` is `(a[i] - 2m) - m = a[i] - 3m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is its original value minus 2m, `a[j]` is `a[j] - 2m` and must be non-zero, `a[i]` is `a[i] - 3m` and must be non-zero, and `i < j`**
