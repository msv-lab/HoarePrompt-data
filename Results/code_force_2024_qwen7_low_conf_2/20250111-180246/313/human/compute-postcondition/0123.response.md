`lit` is a deque, and the code attempts to pop an element from it. Since `lit` is either an empty deque or `k` is less than or equal to 0, an IndexError would have occurred in the initial state, meaning `lit` is empty. Popping an element from an empty deque raises an IndexError again. Therefore, no changes occur to the variables, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1 less than its previous value, `lastState` is -1, `sunk` is 1, `lit` is an empty deque, and an IndexError has occurred.**
