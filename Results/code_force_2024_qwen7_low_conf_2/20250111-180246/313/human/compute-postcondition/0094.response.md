`lastState` is assigned the value `-1`. This overrides the previous value of `lastState`, which was either `0` or `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the last element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` is -1.**
