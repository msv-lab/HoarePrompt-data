The code `lit.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element of the deque `lit`. Since `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the first element removed, removing the leftmost element means `lit` will now be an empty deque or will lose its first element, depending on its current state.

- If `lit` was originally not empty, it will now be a deque with one less element.
- If `lit` was already empty, attempting to remove the leftmost element does nothing.

Given that the precondition includes the possibility that `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the first element removed, the most general state we can describe post-execution is that `lit` will no longer have its first element (if it had one).

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input minus `u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the first element removed, `sunk` is 2, `u` is `None`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `len(lit) == 0` or `k <= 0`. If `lastState` is 0, `lastState` remains 0. If `lastState` is -1, `lastState` remains -1. `lit` loses its leftmost element.**
