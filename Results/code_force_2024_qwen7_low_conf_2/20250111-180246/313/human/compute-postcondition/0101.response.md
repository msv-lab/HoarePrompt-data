Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is `n - u`, `a` is a deque of `n-1` integers, `lit` is either an empty deque or a deque with the next-to-last element removed, `sunk` is 3, `u` is `None`, and `lastState` remains unchanged (either 0 or -1). This is because if `u <= k`, `lit` is updated to be a deque with the next-to-last element removed and `sunk` is set to 3, otherwise, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.**
