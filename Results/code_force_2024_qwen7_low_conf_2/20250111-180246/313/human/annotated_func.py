#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers from input split by spaces, `n` is the last value returned by `R()`, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and the sum of reductions ensures no further operations are possible, `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`, and the output is `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, two positive integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, the function performs the following steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list `a`.
3. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the list `a` respectively.
4. It enters a loop that continues as long as `i < j` and the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2` is greater than 0. Within this loop, it:
   - Decrements `k` by twice the value of `m`, where `m` is the minimum of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, and `k // 2`.
   - Decrements `a[i]` by `m` and advances `i` to the next position if `a[i]` becomes less than 1.
   - Decrements `a[j]` by `m` and retreats `j` to the previous position if `a[j]` becomes less than 1.
5. After exiting the loop, it prints the result calculated as `i + n - j - 1 + (k >= a[i] > 0)`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is 0, `R` is a lambda function that reads input and splits it into integers, `n` is the last value read from the input, `k` is the final value after all reductions, `a` is a list of integers where all elements are either zero or positive and no further operations are possible, and `i` and `j` satisfy `i \geq j` or `i == j`.
