`parent_position` is assigned the value of `parent[current_position]`. This means that `parent_position` now holds the value of the position stored in `parent` at the index `current_position`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is not equal to `final_position`, `moves` is an empty list, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**
