The code sets `initial_position` to `(i, j)`. Given the initial state where `initial_position` is set to `i, 2` if `final_grid[i][2]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`, and `j` is 3, the value of `initial_position` will now be updated to `(i, 3)` regardless of the condition for `final_grid[i][2]`.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is `i, 3`, `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), and `j` is 3.**
