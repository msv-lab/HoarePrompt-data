Postcondition: ***`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `final_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `c` is greater than 0, `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*'.***
