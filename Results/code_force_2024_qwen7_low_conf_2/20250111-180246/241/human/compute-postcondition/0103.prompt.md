You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: grid is a 2D list of strings representing the rectangular grid, where each string represents a row of the grid. r and c are the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. initial_position and final_position are tuples (i, j) representing the coordinates of Amanda's initial and final positions, respectively.
def func_2(grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position):
    visited = [([False] * c) for _ in range(r)]
    q = deque()
    q.append(initial_position)
    visited[initial_position[0]][initial_position[1]] = True
    parent = {}
    while q:
        current_position = q.popleft()
        
        if current_position == final_position:
            break
        
        i, j = current_position
        
        for di, dj in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if func_1(grid, r, c, visited, i, j, ni, nj):
                visited[ni][nj] = True
                q.append((ni, nj))
                parent[ni, nj] = i, j
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position` and `final_position` is not reached, `parent` is a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key. If `final_position` is reached, `q` would be empty, `visited` would mark all reachable positions, `parent` would map each position to its parent, and `final_position` would be in `visited` and `parent`.
    if (final_position not in parent) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position` and `final_position` is not reached, `parent` is a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key, `final_position` is not in `visited` and `final_position` is not in `parent`
    moves = []
    current_position = final_position
    while current_position != initial_position:
        parent_position = parent[current_position]
        
        moves.append((parent_position[0] + 1, parent_position[1] + 1, 
            current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1))
        
        current_position = parent_position
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is `initial_position`, `moves` is a list containing tuples representing the path from `initial_position` to `current_position`, each tuple is formatted as (`parent_position[0] + 1`, `parent_position[1] + 1`, `current_position[0] + 1`, `current_position[1] + 1`), `parent` contains the parent positions for each position in the path from `initial_position` to `current_position`.
    moves.reverse()
    return moves
    #`The program returns the list 'moves' which contains tuples representing the path from 'initial_position' to 'current_position' in reverse order`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
#- `grid`: a 2D list of strings representing a rectangular grid, where each string represents a row of the grid.
#- `r`: an integer representing the number of rows in the grid.
#- `c`: an integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
#- `initial_position`: a tuple `(i, j)` representing Amanda's initial position in the grid.
#- `final_position`: a tuple `(i, j)` representing Amanda's final position in the grid.
#
#The function returns either:
#- `None` in Case_1.
#- A list `moves` containing tuples representing the path from `initial_position` to `current_position` in reverse order in Case_2.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a grid represented as a 2D list of strings, along with the dimensions of the grid and the initial and final positions of Amanda, and return either `None` or a list of tuples representing the path from the initial position to the current position in reverse order.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: `The program returns the list 'moves' which contains tuples representing the path from 'initial_position' to 'current_position' in reverse order`


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
