Postcondition: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position` and `final_position` is not reached, `parent` is a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key, `final_position` is not in `visited` and `final_position` is not in `parent`**
