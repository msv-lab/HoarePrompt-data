Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\)
   - `final_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\)
   - `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0)
   - `i` is \(r-1\)
   - `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set
   - The current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*'
   - `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid
   - If the loop does not execute, both `initial_position` and `final_position` remain `None`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for j in range(c):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `c-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, the range function needs `c` to be at least 1 (since `range(c)` would generate no values if `c` is 0).

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop variable `j` starts from `0` and iterates up to `c-1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `c` is at least 1.

5. **Modified States:**
   - Since `c` must be a positive integer, it should be explicitly stated as `c` is greater than 0.
   - Additionally, `j` must be correctly initialized to the smallest column index where `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid.

Therefore, the final modified states are:
State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `final_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `c` is greater than 0, `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid**
