The code `final_grid = [input() for _ in range(r)]` creates a new list `final_grid` where each element is the result of an input call, repeated `r` times. This means that the `initial_grid` list remains unchanged, and a new list `final_grid` is created with `r` elements, each being the result of an input.

Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, we represent them as generic inputs.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings (each string is an input), `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively; `r` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer; `final_grid` is a list of `r` input strings.**
