The code prints 'NO', which does not affect any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is 0**
