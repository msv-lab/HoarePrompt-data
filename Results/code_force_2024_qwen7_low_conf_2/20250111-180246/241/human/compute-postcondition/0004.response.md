The code assigns `None` to the variable `initial_position`. This means that `initial_position` is now set to `None`, while `final_position` remains unchanged, and `initial_grid` and `final_grid` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is `None`, `final_position` is an input tuple of integers, `r` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `final_grid` is a list of `r` input strings.**
