Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `initial_position` is \((i, j)\)
   - `final_position` is \((i, j)\)
   - `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0)
   - `i` is \(r-2\)
   - `j` is \(j + 1\)
   - If `final_grid[i][j]` equals '*', no changes occur.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `c-1`.
   - The starting value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration is \(j + 1\).

3. **Determining the New Value of `j`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `j` being \(j + 1\) at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be \(j + 2\).

4. **Condition Check:**
   - If `final_grid[i][j]` equals '*', no changes occur. This condition is checked at each iteration.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be \(j + 2\).
   - The other variables (`initial_position`, `final_position`, `c`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the state adjustments for the next iteration of the loop are as follows:

State: **`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is \(j + 2\)**.
