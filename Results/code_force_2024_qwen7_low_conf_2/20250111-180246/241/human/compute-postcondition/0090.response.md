The code `current_position = parent_position` updates the value of `current_position` to be the same as `parent_position`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`, `moves` is `[((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1))]`, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**
