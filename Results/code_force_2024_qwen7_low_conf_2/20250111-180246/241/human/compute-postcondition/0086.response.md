The code `current_position = final_position` assigns the value of `final_position` to the variable `current_position`. This does not affect any other variables.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position` and `final_position` is not reached, `parent` is a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key, `final_position` is not in `visited` and `final_position` is not in `parent`, `current_position` is equal to `final_position`, `moves` is an empty list**
