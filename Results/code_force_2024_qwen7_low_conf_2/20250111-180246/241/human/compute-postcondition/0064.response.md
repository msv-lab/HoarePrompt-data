The code snippet provided is calling a function `func_2` with the parameters `initial_grid`, `r`, `c`, `initial_position`, and `final_position`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given code, and the variables `r` and `c` are not defined in the initial state. Since the function `func_2` is not specified, we cannot determine what `moves` will be assigned. Therefore, we can only state that `moves` will be assigned the return value of `func_2`, and all other variables remain in their initial state.

Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is the return value of `func_2(initial_grid, r, c, initial_position, final_position)`**.
