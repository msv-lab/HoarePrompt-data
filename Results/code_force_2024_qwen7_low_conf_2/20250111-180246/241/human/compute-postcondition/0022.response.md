The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. From the initial state, `initial_position` is set to `i, 3` if `initial_grid[i][3]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`. The value of `j` is 3. Therefore, `final_position` is set to `(i, 3)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is set to `i, 3` if `initial_grid[i][3]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`, `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `j` is 3, `final_position` is `(i, 3)`**
