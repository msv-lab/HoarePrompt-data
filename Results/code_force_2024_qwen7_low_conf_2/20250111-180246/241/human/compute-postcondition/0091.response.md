Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step to determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Information:
- `q` is empty (not used directly in the condition)
- `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`
- `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`
- `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`
- `moves` is `[((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1))]`
- `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```python
while current_position != initial_position:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.
2. **Current State**:
   - `current_position` is set to `parent_position`.
   - `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`.

For the loop to continue, `current_position` must still not be equal to `initial_position`.

### Required Adjustment:
Since `current_position` is updated to `parent_position`, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that `current_position` is still not equal to `initial_position`. This means that the path to `initial_position` should not be complete yet.

Given that `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, and since `current_position` is updated to `parent_position`, we need to ensure that `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position` to allow the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`, `moves` is `[((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1))]`, `parent_position` is the value of `parent[current_position]`**
