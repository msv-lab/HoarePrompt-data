The line `final_position = None` assigns the value `None` to the variable `final_position`. This overrides the previous value of `final_position`, which was an input tuple of integers.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is `None`, `final_position` is `None`, `r` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `final_grid` is a list of `r` input strings.**
