The function `func_3` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the constraints provided, the function likely operates on some predefined or global variables `initial_grid`, `final_grid`, `initial_position`, and `final_position`. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function seems to compare the initial and final positions of Amanda represented in grids and possibly determine if she has moved from her initial position to the final position according to the rules defined by the grid characters ('.', '*', and 'X').

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates on predefined variables `initial_grid`, `final_grid`, `initial_position`, and `final_position`, and returns nothing.**
