The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `grid`: a 2D list of strings representing a rectangular grid, where each string represents a row of the grid.
- `r`: an integer representing the number of rows in the grid.
- `c`: an integer representing the number of columns in the grid.
- `initial_position`: a tuple `(i, j)` representing Amanda's initial position in the grid.
- `final_position`: a tuple `(i, j)` representing Amanda's final position in the grid.

The function returns either:
- `None` in Case_1.
- A list `moves` containing tuples representing the path from `initial_position` to `current_position` in reverse order in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a grid represented as a 2D list of strings, along with the dimensions of the grid and the initial and final positions of Amanda, and return either `None` or a list of tuples representing the path from the initial position to the current position in reverse order.
