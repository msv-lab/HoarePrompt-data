Postcondition: ***`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is still `None`. If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', then `final_position` is set to `(i, 1)`. Otherwise, `final_position` remains `None`. `r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), and `j` is 1.***
