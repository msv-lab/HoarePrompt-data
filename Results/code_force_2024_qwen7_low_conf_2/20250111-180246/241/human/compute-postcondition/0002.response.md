The `input()` function is called without any arguments, which means it will take input from the user. However, no specific variable is assigned this input, so the input value is not stored anywhere in the code provided. The values of `initial_grid`, `initial_position`, `final_position`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings (each string is an input), `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively; `r` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer; an input value is taken but not assigned to any variable.**
