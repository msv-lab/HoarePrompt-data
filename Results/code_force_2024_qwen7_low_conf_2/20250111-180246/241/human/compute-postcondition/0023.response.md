Postcondition: ***`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is set to `i, 3` if `final_grid[i][3]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`. `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `j` is 3, and if `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `final_position` is `(i, 3)`; otherwise, `final_position` remains `None`.***
