Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'.
   - `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'.
   - `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `moves` is 1.
   - `move` is unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for move in moves:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the variable `move` for each value in `moves`.
   - Given that `moves` is currently 1, the loop will only execute once if `move` is 1.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we assume it performs some operation related to moving from `initial_position` to `final_position`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - After the first iteration, `move` would still be 1 since no change was mentioned in the problem statement.
   - For the loop to execute again, `moves` should have more than one element. However, based on the given information, `moves` is explicitly stated as 1, indicating there is only one move left to make.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again with the current values of `moves` and `move`.

Given the above analysis, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop will not execute again under the given conditions.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is 1; `move` is unchanged**
