Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', and `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0).**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the grid, setting `initial_position` and `final_position` based on the first occurrence of '*' in each row.
- After all iterations, `initial_position` will be the coordinates of the last '*' found in the grid when traversing row by row.
- Similarly, `final_position` will be the coordinates of the last '*' found in the grid.
- If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., no '*' is present in the grid), both `initial_position` and `final_position` will remain `None`.

Thus, after all the iterations of the loop, the values of `initial_position` and `final_position` will reflect the coordinates of the last '*' found in `initial_grid` and `final_grid`, respectively.
