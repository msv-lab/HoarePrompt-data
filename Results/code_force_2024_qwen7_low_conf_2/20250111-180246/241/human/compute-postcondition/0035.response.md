Postcondition: ***`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is \(j + 1\) (the next smallest column index that meets the conditions and is in the range \([0, c-1]\)). If `initial_grid[i][j]` equals '*', no changes occur.***
