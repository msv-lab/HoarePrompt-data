The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. This means that `final_position` now holds the values of `i` and `j`. The initial values of `i` and `j` are part of the initial state, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is set to `i, 2` if `initial_grid[i][2]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`, `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `j` is 2, and `final_position` is `i, 2`.**
