Postcondition: ***`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is greater than 0, \(j+1\) is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][(j+1)+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][(j+1)+c]` is '*', \((j+1)+c\) must be less than the number of columns in the grid, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j+1]` is '*'. If `final_grid[i][j+1]` is '*', its value remains '*'; otherwise, there is no change in the value of `final_grid[i][j+1]`.***
