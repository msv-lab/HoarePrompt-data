The code sets `final_position` to `(i, j)`. This changes the value of `final_position` from \((r-2, j+c)\) to \((i, j)\). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is greater than 0, `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'. If `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', its value remains '*'; otherwise, there is no change in the value of `final_grid[i][j]`. Additionally, `j` is incremented by 1.**
