Let's break down the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `q` is empty
- `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`
- `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`
- `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`
- `moves` contains the coordinates of the move made and the position information.
- `parent_position` is now equal to `parent[current_position]`

### `while` Loop Condition:
```python
while current_position != initial_position:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
The `while` loop continues as long as `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.

Given the current state:
- `current_position` is set to `parent_position`
- The loop condition is `current_position != initial_position`

To continue the loop, `current_position` must still not be equal to `initial_position`. This means we need to ensure that `current_position` remains different from `initial_position` for the next iteration.

### Steps to Adjust the State:
1. **Ensure `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`:**
   - Since `current_position` is set to `parent_position`, we need to make sure that `parent_position` is not equal to `initial_position` for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:
We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can continue to the next iteration. Specifically, we need to ensure that `parent_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is now equal to `parent_position`, `moves` is [((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1)), (parent[current_position][0] + 1, parent[current_position][1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)], `parent_position` is not equal to `initial_position`**
