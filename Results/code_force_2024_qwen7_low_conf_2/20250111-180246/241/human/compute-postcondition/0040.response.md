Postcondition: ***`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+2)\) and `final_position` is \((i, j)\). Additionally, `c` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `i` is \(r-2\) while `j` is \(j + 2\). If the value at `initial_grid[r-2][j+2]` is '*', the condition remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition outcome.***
