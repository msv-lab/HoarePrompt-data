The code `final_position = i, j` assigns the tuple `(i, j)` to the variable `final_position`. According to the initial state, `final_position` was already equal to \((r-2, j+c)\). After executing the code, `final_position` will now be \((i, j)\).

Let's summarize the changes:
- `final_position` changes from \((r-2, j+c)\) to \((i, j)\).
- The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is greater than 0, `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid, the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and the value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'**.
