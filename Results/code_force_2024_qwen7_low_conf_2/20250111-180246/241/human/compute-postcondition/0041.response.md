The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `final_position`. Given that `i` is \(r-2\) and `j` is \(j+2\), the value of `final_position` is updated accordingly. The initial state of `initial_position` and the condition regarding `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+2)\), `final_position` is \((r-2, j+2)\), `c` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is \(r-2\), `j` is \(j+2\)**
