The code snippet `print(len(moves))` prints the length of the `moves` variable. Given that `moves` is a non-zero value, its length (which is the number of elements in it) will be printed. However, since `moves` is not specified as a list or any other collection type, we assume it is a single value (e.g., an integer), and the length of a single value is 1.

Therefore, the code will print `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is 1; printed output is '1'**
