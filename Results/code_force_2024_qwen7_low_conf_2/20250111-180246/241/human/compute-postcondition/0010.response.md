Postcondition: ***`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is either `(i, 0)` or remains `None`, `final_position` is `None`, `r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), and `j` is 0. If `initial_grid[i][0]` equals '*', then `initial_position` is set to `(i, 0)`. Otherwise, `initial_position` remains `None`.***
