The code `final_position = i, j` updates the value of `final_position` to be the same as the current value of `(i, j)`. Since `i` is \(r-2\) and `j` is \(j + 1\), the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. The other variables (`initial_position`, `c`, `initial_grid[i][j]`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is \(j + 1\)**
