Postcondition: **`initial_position` is \((i, j)\) where \(j\) is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j] == '*'` and was not previously set, otherwise `initial_position` is `None`, `final_position` is \((i, j)\) where \(j\) is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j] == '*'` and was not previously set, otherwise `final_position` is `None`, `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j] == '*'` and was not previously set, and the current value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', `j` must be in the range \([0, c-1]\)**
