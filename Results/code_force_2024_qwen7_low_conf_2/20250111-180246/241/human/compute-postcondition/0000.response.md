The code `r, c = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `r` and `c`. The initial states of `r` and `c` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50. After executing this line of code, these values are replaced by the input integers.

Output State: **`initial_grid` and `final_grid` are lists of strings representing the initial and final positions of Amanda, respectively, where each string consists of characters '.', '*', and 'X'; `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively; `r` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer**
