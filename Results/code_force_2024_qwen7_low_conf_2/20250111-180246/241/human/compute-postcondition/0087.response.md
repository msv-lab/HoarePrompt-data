Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop condition step by step:

### Given State:
- `q` is empty (a queue)
- `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`
- `final_position` is not reached (meaning `final_position` is not in `visited`)
- `final_position` is not in `parent` (a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key)
- `current_position` is equal to `final_position`
- `moves` is an empty list

### Loop Condition:
```
while current_position != initial_position:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.
2. **Current State**: The current position (`current_position`) is set to `final_position`, and `final_position` is not in `visited` and not in `parent`. This means that the search algorithm (likely A* or BFS) has found the `final_position` but hasn't backtracked to find the path to `initial_position` yet.

### Steps to Ensure the Loop Executes at Least Once:
1. **`current_position`**: Since `current_position` is already equal to `final_position`, the loop condition `current_position != initial_position` will evaluate to `False` right now, meaning the loop won't execute at all.
2. **Backtracking Requirement**: For the loop to execute, we need to backtrack from `final_position` to `initial_position`. To do this, we need to adjust the state so that the search algorithm can correctly backtrack.

### Adjusted State:
To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state so that there is a valid path from `final_position` back to `initial_position` through the `parent` dictionary. This means:
- `current_position` should not be equal to `final_position` for the first iteration.
- There should be a valid parent position for `final_position` in the `parent` dictionary, which will allow the search algorithm to backtrack to `initial_position`.

### Updated State:
- `q` is empty (a queue)
- `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`
- `final_position` is not reached (meaning `final_position` is not in `visited`)
- `final_position` is not in `parent` (a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key)
- `current_position` should not be equal to `final_position` for the first iteration
- `moves` is an empty list

### Final Answer:
State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `final_position` is not in `parent`, `current_position` is not equal to `final_position`, `moves` is an empty list**
