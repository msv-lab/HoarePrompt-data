Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings.
   - `initial_position` is set to `i, 2` if `final_grid[i][2]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`.
   - `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `j` is initially 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(c)`, meaning it will run from `j = 2` to `j = c-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to the next value within the range `range(c)`.

5. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` starts at 2 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, the next value of `j` will be 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < c`.

6. **Adjust States:**
   - `initial_grid` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify this variable.
   - `initial_position` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify this variable.
   - `c` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify this variable.
   - `j` will be incremented to 3.

Based on these steps, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is set to `i, 2` if `final_grid[i][2]` is '*', otherwise it remains `None`, `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), and `j` is 3.**
