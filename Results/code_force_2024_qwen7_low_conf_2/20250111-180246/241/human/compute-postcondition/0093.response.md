The code appends a tuple to the `moves` list. The tuple being appended is constructed from the values of `parent_position` and `current_position`, each incremented by `(1, 1)`.

Given:
- `parent_position` is equal to `parent[current_position]`.
- `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`.
- `moves` is initially `[((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1))]`.

After executing the line of code, `moves` will have the original tuple plus the new tuple:
- The first part of the new tuple is `parent_position` incremented by `(1, 1)`, which is equivalent to `parent[current_position] + (1, 1)`.
- The second part of the new tuple is `current_position` incremented by `(1, 1)`, which is equivalent to `current_position + (1, 1)`.

Therefore, the updated `moves` will be:
```python
moves = [((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1)), (parent[current_position][0] + 1, parent[current_position][1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)]
```

Output State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`, `moves` is [((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1)), (parent[current_position][0] + 1, parent[current_position][1] + 1, current_position[0] + 1, current_position[1] + 1)], `parent_position` is now equal to `parent[current_position]`.**
