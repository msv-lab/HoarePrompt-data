The line of code `moves = []` creates an empty list named `moves`. This does not affect the values of `q`, `visited`, `parent`, or `final_position`. 

Output State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position` and `final_position` is not reached, `parent` is a dictionary where the key is a tuple representing a position and the value is the tuple representing the parent position for that key, `final_position` is not in `visited` and `final_position` is not in `parent`, `moves` is an empty list**
