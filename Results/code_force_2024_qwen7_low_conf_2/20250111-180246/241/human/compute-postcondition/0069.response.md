The code `print(*move)` prints the elements of the `move` variable, but it does not assign any new value to `move`. Since the initial state does not provide any specific value for `move`, we assume `move` is an empty list or not defined before this line. After executing the print statement, the `move` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is 1; `move` is unchanged**
