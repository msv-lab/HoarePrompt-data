Postcondition: ***`initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples representing the last row and column indices for which `initial_grid` and `final_grid` respectively are set to '*', and `c` is a positive integer. If `moves` is non-zero, `move` is printed. Otherwise, no specific change occurs to the variables as `moves` remains 0.***
