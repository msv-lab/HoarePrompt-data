The code `print(*move)` simply prints the value of the variable `move`. Since no assignment or modification is done to any variable in this line, the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `move` variable is printed, but its value is not specified in the code snippet.

Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where \(i\) is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and \(j\) is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where \(i\) is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and \(j\) is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is 0; `move` is printed.**
