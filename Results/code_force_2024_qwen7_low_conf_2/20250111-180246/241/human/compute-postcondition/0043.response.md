Output State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\)` if the loop executes at least once, `final_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\)` if the loop executes at least once, `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', and `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid. If the loop does not execute, both `initial_position` and `final_position` remain `None`.**
