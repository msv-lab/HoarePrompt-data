Postcondition: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings, `initial_position` is either `(i, 0)` or remains `None`, `final_position` is still `None`, `r` must be greater than 0, `c` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), and `j` is 0. If `final_grid[i][j]` equals '*', then `initial_position` is set to `(i, 0)`. Otherwise, `initial_position` remains `None`. The current value of `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', and `j` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `j` is now 1).**
