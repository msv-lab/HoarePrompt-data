The code `print('YES')` does not affect any of the variables' values but simply prints 'YES' to the console. The `moves` variable retains its non-zero value from the function call, and the other variables (`initial_position`, `final_position`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple `(i, j)` where `i` is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and `j` is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is non-zero; printed output is 'YES'**
