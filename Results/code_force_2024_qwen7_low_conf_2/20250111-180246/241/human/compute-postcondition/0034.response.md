The code assigns the value of `i` and `j` to `initial_position`. Given the initial state where `initial_position` is \((i, j)\), and the code does not change the values of `i` or `j`, the output state remains the same.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is \(j + 1\) (the next smallest column index that meets the conditions and is in the range \([0, c-1]\)).**
