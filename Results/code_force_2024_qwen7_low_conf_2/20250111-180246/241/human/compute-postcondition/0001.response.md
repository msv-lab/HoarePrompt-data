The code initializes `initial_grid` by taking `r` lines of input, where each line is a string. The previous values of `initial_position` and `final_position` are not affected, and `r` and `c` are input integers. After executing the code, `initial_grid` will contain `r` strings, each string being the input received.

Output State: **`initial_grid` is a list of `r` strings (each string is an input), `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples of integers representing the coordinates of Amanda's body in the initial and final positions, respectively; `r` is an input integer; `c` is an input integer**
