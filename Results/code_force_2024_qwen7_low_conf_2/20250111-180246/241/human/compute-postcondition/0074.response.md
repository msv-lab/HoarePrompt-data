Output State: **`initial_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where \(i\) is the last row index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and \(j\) is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `final_position` is a tuple \((i, j)\) where \(i\) is the last row index for which `final_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and \(j\) is the smallest column index such that `final_grid[i][j]` is '*'; `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0); `moves` is 0; `move` is printed**

### Explanation:
- **Initial Conditions**: 
  - `initial_position` and `final_position` are tuples defining specific positions in the grids.
  - `c` is a positive integer.
  - `moves` starts at 1 and is decremented by 1 each time the loop iterates.

- **Loop Code**:
  ```python
  for move in moves:
      print(*move)
  ```

- **Output State Analysis**:
  - After the first iteration, `moves` becomes 0, and the loop stops executing further iterations.
  - Therefore, after the loop finishes, `moves` will be 0, and `move` will be the value it had during the last iteration, which would be printed out.

Since the loop runs until `moves` reaches 0, and `moves` starts at 1 and is decremented by 1 each iteration, the loop will run exactly once. Thus, `move` will be printed exactly once.

### Final Values:
- `initial_position` remains unchanged.
- `final_position` remains unchanged.
- `c` remains unchanged.
- `moves` is 0.
- `move` is printed, meaning it retains the value it had during the last iteration of the loop.

This matches the provided output states for the first few iterations, confirming our analysis.
