The code assigns the value of `(i, j)` to `final_position`. Since `i` and `j` are already defined in the initial state, the value of `final_position` is directly assigned as `(i, j)`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', and `j` must be in the range \([0, c-1]\).**
