Postcondition: ***`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `final_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\), `c` is greater than 0, `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', `j+c` must be less than the number of columns in the grid, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', with the additional condition that if `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', then the value of `final_grid[i][j]` remains '*'. Otherwise, there is no change in the value of `final_grid[i][j]`.***
