The initial code sets `initial_position` and `final_position` to the same value, which is \((r-2, j+c)\). It also mentions that `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'`, and this value is set to '*'. Additionally, `j` is incremented by 1. The value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and if `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', its value remains '*'. Otherwise, there is no change in the value of `final_grid[i][j]`.

The code snippet:
```python
initial_position = i, j
```
sets `initial_position` to a tuple containing `i` and `j`. Since `initial_position` and `final_position` were initially the same, `final_position` remains unchanged.

The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` is now `j + 1`.

The value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and if `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', its value remains '*'. Otherwise, the value of `final_grid[i][j]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \(i, j\); `final_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\); `j` is \(j + 1\); the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*'; if `final_grid[i][j]` is '*', its value remains '*'; otherwise, there is no change in the value of `final_grid[i][j]`.**
