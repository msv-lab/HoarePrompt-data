Postcondition: ***`initial_position` is \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[i][j] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', and `j` must be in the range \([0, c-1]\).***
