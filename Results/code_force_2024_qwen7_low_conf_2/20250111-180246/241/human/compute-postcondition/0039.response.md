The code `initial_position = i, j` updates the value of `initial_position` to be the tuple `(i, j)`. Since `i` is already defined as \(r-2\) and `j` is defined as \(j + 2\), `initial_position` is updated to \((r-2, j+2)\). The other variables (`final_position`, `c`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+2)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\), `c` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is \(r-2\), and `j` is \(j + 2\)**
