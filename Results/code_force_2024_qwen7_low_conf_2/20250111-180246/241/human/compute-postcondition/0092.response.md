The code `parent_position = parent[current_position]` assigns the value of `parent[current_position]` to `parent_position`. This does not affect the values of other variables.

Output State: **`q` is empty, `visited` is a 2D list of booleans with dimensions `r` by `c`, where `visited[i][j]` is `True` for all positions that were reachable from `initial_position`, `final_position` is not reached and not in `visited`, `current_position` is not equal to `initial_position`, `moves` is `[((p_x + 1, p_y + 1), (c_x + 1, c_y + 1))]`, `parent_position` is now equal to `parent[current_position]`.**
