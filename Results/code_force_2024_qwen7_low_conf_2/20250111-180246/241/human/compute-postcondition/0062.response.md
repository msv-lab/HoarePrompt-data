Output State: **`initial_position` is \((r-2, j+c)\) or \((i, j)\), `final_position` is \((i, j)\) or \((r-2, j+c)\), `c` is a positive integer, `j` is the smallest column index such that `initial_grid[r-2][j+c] == '*'` and was not previously set, the current value of `initial_grid[r-2][j+c]` is '*', \(j+c\) must be less than the number of columns in the grid, and the value of `initial_grid[i][j]` is '*', where \(i\) is the last column index for which `initial_grid[i][j]` is set to '*', and the value of `final_grid[i][j]` remains '*' if it was set to '*' during the loop execution; otherwise, there is no change in the value of `final_grid[i][j]`. If the loop does not execute, both `initial_position` and `final_position` remain `None`.**
