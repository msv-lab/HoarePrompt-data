#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D grid representing Amanda's body, the dimensions of the grid, a 2D visited list, and coordinates for removing and adding a pixel. It checks whether adding a new pixel at coordinates `(i2, j2)` to Amanda's body is valid based on several conditions:

1. The new pixel must be within the grid boundaries.
2. The new pixel cannot already be occupied by Amanda or marked as visited.
3. The new pixel must have at least two adjacent pixels that are also part of Amanda's body (denoted by `'*'`).

If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `False`. If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the coordinates `(i2, j2)` are out of the grid boundaries, the function correctly returns `False`.
- If the new pixel is already occupied by Amanda (`grid[i2][j2] == '*'`) or marked as visited (`visited[i2][j2]` is `True`), the function correctly returns `False`.
- If the new pixel does not have at least two adjacent pixels that are part of Amanda's body, the function correctly returns `False`.

The function does not explicitly remove the old pixel at coordinates `(i1, j1)` or update the `visited` list, which might be necessary for further processing.

    #`The program returns the list 'moves' which contains tuples representing the path from 'initial_position' to 'current_position' in reverse order`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a grid represented as a 2D list of strings, along with the dimensions of the grid (number of rows `r` and columns `c`), and the initial and final positions of Amanda within the grid. It attempts to find a path from Amanda's initial position to her final position using a breadth-first search algorithm. The function returns either `None` or a list of tuples representing the path from the initial position to the final position in reverse order.

1. The function initializes a `visited` matrix to keep track of visited positions, a queue `q` for BFS, and a `parent` dictionary to store the parent positions for each position in the grid.
2. It performs a breadth-first search starting from the initial position. For each position, it checks all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). If the next position is within bounds, not yet visited, and accessible according to `func_1`, it marks the position as visited, adds it to the queue, and records its parent.
3. After the BFS completes, if the final position is not reached, the function returns `None`.
4. If the final position is reached, it traces back the path from the final position to the initial position using the `parent` dictionary, storing the path in the `moves` list.
5. The `moves` list is reversed to represent the path from the initial position to the final position, and then returned.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `func_1` returns `False` for all possible moves from the initial position, the function will return `None` without checking other positions.
- The function assumes that the grid is non-empty and the positions are valid. No checks are performed to ensure these conditions are met.
- The function does not handle cases where the grid contains obstacles or non-passable cells; it only checks if the next position is within bounds and not visited.

If `moves` is non-zero, `move` is printed. Otherwise, no specific change occurs to the variables as `moves` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the dimensions and contents of two grids (initial_grid and final_grid) from standard input, identifies the starting and ending positions of Amanda within these grids, calls another function (func_2) to determine a sequence of moves that transform initial_grid into final_grid, and prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves if such a sequence exists, otherwise it prints "NO". The function does not return anything. Potential edge cases include scenarios where Amanda's starting and ending positions do not exist in either grid, or when the input grids are empty. Additionally, if func_2 does not return a valid sequence of moves, the function will incorrectly print "NO" without any further information.
