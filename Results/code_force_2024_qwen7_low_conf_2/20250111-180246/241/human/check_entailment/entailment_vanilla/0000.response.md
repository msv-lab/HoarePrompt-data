Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires checking if Amanda (an amoeba) can move from its initial position to its final position on a grid while maintaining connectivity of its body and adhering to the constraints provided.
   - The solution involves two primary functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Additionally, `func_3` handles input/output and calls the other functions.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if a pixel at `(i2, j2)` can be added to the body. It ensures that the pixel is within bounds, not blocked, and that it is adjacent to at least two other pixels already in the body.
   - The logic is correct because it verifies the conditions necessary for a valid addition of a pixel to the body while maintaining connectivity.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
   - It marks visited pixels and uses a dictionary (`parent`) to keep track of the path taken.
   - The logic is sound, but we need to ensure that the BFS respects the movement rules (shrinking and growing correctly).
   - The function constructs the moves in reverse order, which is correct for backtracking from the final position to the initial position.

4. **Analysis of `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the grid dimensions and the initial and final positions from the input.
   - It initializes the grids and finds the starting and ending positions.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the moves and prints the result accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the output format as specified.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the problem's requirements and constraints.
   - The BFS approach in `func_2` ensures that the path is found if it exists.
   - The checks in `func_1` ensure that each move maintains the required connectivity.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets all the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
