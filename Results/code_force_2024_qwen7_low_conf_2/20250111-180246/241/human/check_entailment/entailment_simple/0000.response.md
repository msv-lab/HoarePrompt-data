Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that Amanda's body remains connected throughout the movement process. Here are the key issues:

1. **Connected Body Check**: The program does not explicitly check whether Amanda's body remains connected after each move. While `func_1` checks the connectivity of the new pixel being added to the body, it does not ensure that the entire body remains connected after the removal of a pixel and addition of a new one. The connectivity check in `func_1` is limited to the new pixel being added and does not consider the overall connectedness of the body.

2. **Path Planning**: The function `func_2` uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position. However, BFS alone does not guarantee that the resulting path will maintain the connectedness of Amanda's body during each step of the movement. The BFS finds a sequence of valid moves but does not enforce that the body remains connected throughout the sequence.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the sequence of moves in the correct format if a solution exists. However, it does not validate whether the body remains connected after each move, which is a crucial requirement as stated in the problem description.

### Example Counter-Example:

Consider the following grid configuration:

```
5 8

.******.
**.X**..
*******.
**.X**..
.******

...X****
.*******
...X****
.******
```

- **Initial Position**:
  ```
  .******.
  **.X**..
  *******.
  **.X**..
  .******
  ```

- **Final Position**:
  ```
  ...X****
  .*******
  ...X****
  .******
  ```

The annotated program might find a path, but it does not ensure that Amanda's body remains connected after each move. For instance, the path found might involve moves that break the connectivity of Amanda's body, which violates the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program does not enforce that Amanda's body remains connected during each move, which is a critical requirement according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is **False** for meeting the problem requirements.
