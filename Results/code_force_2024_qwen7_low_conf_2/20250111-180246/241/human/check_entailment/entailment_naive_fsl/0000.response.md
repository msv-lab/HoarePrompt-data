Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding a path from the initial position to the final position using BFS. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` checks connectivity but does not fully ensure it**: The function `func_1` checks if the new position `(i2, j2)` is valid and if it connects to at least two other body pixels. However, it does not ensure that the entire body remains connected after the move. For example, consider the following grid:
    ```
    .******
    **.X**..
    *******
    **.X**..
    .******
    ```
    The initial position is the top row, and the final position is the bottom row. While the function might allow a move that disconnects part of the body, it does not guarantee that the body will remain connected after the move.

2. **Function `func_2` does not handle the shrinking and growing of the body correctly**: The function `func_2` uses BFS to find a path from the initial position to the final position. However, it does not explicitly handle the shrinking and growing of the body. It simply moves the body from one position to another without ensuring that the body remains connected during the process. For example, consider the following grid:
    ```
    .******
    **.X**..
    *******
    **.X**..
    .******
    ```
    The initial position is the top row, and the final position is the bottom row. The program might suggest moves that disconnect the body, such as moving from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner without ensuring the body remains connected.

3. **Lack of explicit validation of body connectivity during moves**: The program does not validate that the body remains connected after each move. It assumes that the moves suggested by BFS will keep the body connected, which is not guaranteed without additional checks.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered correct as it does not guarantee that Amanda's body remains connected during the movement. Therefore, the program fails to meet the problem description in all potential cases.
