Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks whether a new pixel can be added to Amanda's body based on the problem constraints. It ensures that the new pixel is within the grid, not already part of Amanda's body, and has at least two adjacent pixels that are part of her body. This function handles the core logic required to validate potential moves.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from Amanda's initial position to her final position. It leverages `func_1` to ensure each move is valid. After finding a path, it constructs the sequence of moves by tracing back from the final position to the initial position. The function correctly formats and returns the sequence of moves if a path exists, otherwise, it returns `None`.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function orchestrates the entire process. It reads the input grids and identifies the initial and final positions of Amanda. It then calls `func_2` to find a sequence of moves. If a valid sequence is found, it prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves. If no valid sequence is found, it prints "NO". The function handles the I/O and ensures the correct output format.

Given that:
- `func_1` validates individual moves correctly.
- `func_2` finds a valid path using BFS and constructs the sequence of moves.
- `func_3` integrates the input reading, position identification, and output printing, ensuring the program meets the problem requirements.

Since all functions work correctly and collectively meet the problem's requirements, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
