### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires checking if Amanda (an amoeba) can move from its initial position to its final position on a grid while maintaining connectivity of its body and adhering to the constraints provided.
   - The solution involves three primary functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if a pixel at `(i2, j2)` can be added to the body. It ensures that the pixel is within bounds, not blocked, and that it is adjacent to at least two other pixels already in the body.
   - The logic is correct because it verifies the conditions necessary for a valid addition of a pixel to the body while maintaining connectivity.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
   - It marks visited pixels and uses a dictionary (`parent`) to keep track of the path taken.
   - The logic is sound, but we need to ensure that the BFS respects the movement rules (shrinking and growing correctly).
   - The function constructs the moves in reverse order, which is correct for backtracking from the final position to the initial position.
   - However, the BFS in `func_2` assumes that any path found is a valid sequence of moves, but it does not explicitly ensure that each move maintains the required connectivity at every step. This is a critical point.

4. **Analysis of `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the grid dimensions and the initial and final positions from the input.
   - It initializes the grids and finds the starting and ending positions.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the moves and prints the result accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the output format as specified.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the problem's requirements and constraints.
   - The BFS approach in `func_2` ensures that a path is found if it exists.
   - The checks in `func_1` ensure that each move maintains the required connectivity.
   - However, `func_2` does not explicitly verify that the sequence of moves maintains connectivity at every step. If a move leads to a disconnected body, the program might still claim a successful path, which would be incorrect.

Given the above points, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because `func_2` does not ensure that each move maintains the required connectivity, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

### Final:
**False**
