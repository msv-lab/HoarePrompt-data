### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires checking if Amanda (an amoeba) can move from its initial position to its final position on a grid while maintaining connectivity of its body and adhering to the constraints provided.
   - The solution involves two primary functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Additionally, `func_3` handles input/output and calls the other functions.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if a pixel at `(i2, j2)` can be added to the body. It ensures that the pixel is within bounds, not blocked, and that it is adjacent to at least two other pixels already in the body.
   - The logic is correct because it verifies the conditions necessary for a valid addition of a pixel to the body while maintaining connectivity.
   - **Validation:** The annotations confirm that `func_1` correctly checks the bounds, adjacency, and connectivity requirements.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - This function uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find a path from the initial position to the final position.
   - It marks visited pixels and uses a dictionary (`parent`) to keep track of the path taken.
   - The logic is sound, but we need to ensure that the BFS respects the movement rules (shrinking and growing correctly).
   - The function constructs the moves in reverse order, which is correct for backtracking from the final position to the initial position.
   - **Validation:** The annotations confirm that `func_2` correctly performs BFS and maintains the connectivity of the amoeba's body. However, there are a few points to consider:
     - The function does not explicitly check if the removed pixel (at `(i1, j1)`) is part of the initial body. While it's implied that this check is done implicitly, it's crucial to ensure that the body remains connected throughout the process.
     - The function does not update the `visited` list or remove the old pixel at `(i1, j1)` before adding the new pixel at `(i2, j2)`. This could lead to incorrect paths if the old pixel was essential for maintaining connectivity.

4. **Analysis of `func_3`:**
   - This function reads the grid dimensions and the initial and final positions from the input.
   - It initializes the grids and finds the starting and ending positions.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the moves and prints the result accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the output format as specified.
   - **Validation:** The annotations confirm that `func_3` correctly reads and processes the input grids and outputs the result in the required format.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program follows the problem's requirements and constraints.
   - The BFS approach in `func_2` ensures that the path is found if it exists.
   - The checks in `func_1` ensure that each move maintains the required connectivity.
   - However, the lack of explicit validation of the removed pixel (ensuring the body remains connected) could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:
While the overall logic seems sound and the program meets the problem's requirements, there is a potential flaw in the implementation of `func_2` regarding the removal and addition of pixels, which could lead to invalid paths if the body is not maintained correctly.

**Final: False**
