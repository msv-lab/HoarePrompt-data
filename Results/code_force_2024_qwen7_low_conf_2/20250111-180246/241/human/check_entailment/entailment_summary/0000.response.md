Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a move is valid by ensuring the new pixel (to be added to Amanda's body) is within the grid boundaries, not already occupied by Amanda, and has at least two adjacent pixels that are part of Amanda's body. This is essential for maintaining Amanda's body as a connected region.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses breadth-first search (BFS) to find a path from Amanda's initial position to her final position. It ensures that each step is valid by calling `func_1` before adding a position to the queue. The path is traced back from the final position to the initial position, providing a sequence of moves.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, identifies the initial and final positions of Amanda, and calls `func_2` to find a sequence of moves. If such a sequence exists, it prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves. If no sequence exists, it prints "NO".

Given the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to follow the rules and requirements specified in the problem statement. Here's why:

- **Connected Body Maintenance**: `func_1` ensures that the new pixel added to Amanda's body maintains the connectivity of her body.
- **Valid Path Finding**: `func_2` uses BFS to find a valid path from the initial to the final position, ensuring that each step is valid through `func_1`.
- **Input Handling and Output**: `func_3` correctly handles the input reading and writing output as required.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is designed to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
