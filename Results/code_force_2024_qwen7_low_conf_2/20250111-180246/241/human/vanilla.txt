- The program follows the problem's requirements and constraints.
   - The BFS approach in `func_2` ensures that the path is found if it exists.
   - The checks in `func_1` ensure that each move maintains the required connectivity.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets all the specified requirements.
