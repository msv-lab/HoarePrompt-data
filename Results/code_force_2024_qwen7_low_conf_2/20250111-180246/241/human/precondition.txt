grid is a 2D list representing the rectangular grid, where each cell is either a dot (\texttt{.}), an asterisk (\texttt{*}), or an \texttt{X}. r and c are the dimensions of the grid (1 ≤ r, c ≤ 50). visited is a set used to keep track of visited cells during the movement. i1, j1, i2, j2 are integers representing the coordinates of the pixel being removed and the pixel being added, respectively (1 ≤ i1, i2 ≤ r, 1 ≤ j1, j2 ≤ c).
