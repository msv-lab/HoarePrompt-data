The function `func_1` accepts a 2D grid representing Amanda's body, the dimensions of the grid, a 2D visited list, and coordinates for removing and adding a pixel. It checks whether adding a new pixel at coordinates `(i2, j2)` to Amanda's body is valid based on several conditions:

1. The new pixel must be within the grid boundaries.
2. The new pixel cannot already be occupied by Amanda or marked as visited.
3. The new pixel must have at least two adjacent pixels that are also part of Amanda's body (denoted by `'*'`).

If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns `False`. If all conditions are satisfied, the function returns `True`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If the coordinates `(i2, j2)` are out of the grid boundaries, the function correctly returns `False`.
- If the new pixel is already occupied by Amanda (`grid[i2][j2] == '*'`) or marked as visited (`visited[i2][j2]` is `True`), the function correctly returns `False`.
- If the new pixel does not have at least two adjacent pixels that are part of Amanda's body, the function correctly returns `False`.

The function does not explicitly remove the old pixel at coordinates `(i1, j1)` or update the `visited` list, which might be necessary for further processing.
