The function reads the dimensions and contents of two grids (initial_grid and final_grid) from standard input, identifies the starting and ending positions of Amanda within these grids, calls another function (func_2) to determine a sequence of moves that transform initial_grid into final_grid, and prints "YES" followed by the number of moves and the moves themselves if such a sequence exists, otherwise it prints "NO". The function does not return anything. Potential edge cases include scenarios where Amanda's starting and ending positions do not exist in either grid, or when the input grids are empty. Additionally, if func_2 does not return a valid sequence of moves, the function will incorrectly print "NO" without any further information.
