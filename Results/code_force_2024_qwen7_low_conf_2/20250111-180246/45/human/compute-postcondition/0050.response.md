`placed` is assigned the value `True`. This means `placed` is now `True`, but the conditions under which `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True and the contents of `groups` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `groups` must contain at least one element and now also contains `num`, `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True; `placed` is True.

Output State: **`groups` must contain at least one element and now also contains `num`, `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True; `placed` is True**
