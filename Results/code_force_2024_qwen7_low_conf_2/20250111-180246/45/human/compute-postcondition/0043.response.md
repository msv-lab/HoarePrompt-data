`groups` appends a new list containing the value of `num` to itself. Since the initial state mentions that `groups` contains at least one group with `num` appended to it if the loop executed, and `num` retains its original value, appending `[num]` to `groups` means that `groups` now contains at least two groups: one existing group and a new group with the value of `num`. The value of `placed` remains `False` because the code only modifies `groups` and does not affect `placed`.

Output State: **`groups` contains at least two groups, one of which is [num]; `placed` is `False`**
