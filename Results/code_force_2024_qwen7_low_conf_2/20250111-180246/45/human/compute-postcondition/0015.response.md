Functionality: **The function `func_3` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers, then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs. It prints the result returned by `func_2` for each test case. The function does not specify any return value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printing the results of calling `func_2` for each one. If any input values exceed their specified ranges (e.g., `t > 10^4`, `n > 2Â·10^5`, or integers not being less than \(2^{31}\)), the program will raise a ValueError. Additionally, if `func_2` is called with invalid arguments, the program may behave unpredictably unless `func_2` itself handles such cases.**

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
1. If `t` exceeds \(10^4\) or `n` exceeds \(2 \cdot 10^5\), a ValueError will be raised due to the type conversion of input values.
2. If the input integers are not less than \(2^{31}\), a ValueError will be raised.
3. If `func_2` is called with invalid arguments (e.g., non-integer `n` or non-list `integers`), the behavior is undefined unless `func_2` explicitly handles these cases.
