`group.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the list `group`. Since `num` retains its original integer value, the length of `group` increases by 1, and the last element of `group` is now `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `groups` contains at least one element plus `num`, `num` retains its original integer value, and `placed` is set to `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `False`, the values of `groups`, `num`, and `placed` remain unchanged from the precondition.
