Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `integers` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `groups` is a list with at least one element, and `group` is now either `groups` plus `[num]` (if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to true) or remains unchanged (if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to false). Additionally, `placed` is `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to true, and `False` otherwise.**
