The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means the `integers` list is updated with the new values from the input, and the `n` variable, which represents the length of this list, remains unchanged. 

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, and `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), after executing the code, the `integers` list will be updated with the values provided by the user.

Let's assume the user inputs `3 5 7` (this is just an example; the actual input could be different). In this case, `n` would remain `3`, and `integers` would be `[3, 5, 7]`.

Since the exact input is not specified, we'll keep the general form:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, and `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\) and is equal to the integer values input by the user.**
