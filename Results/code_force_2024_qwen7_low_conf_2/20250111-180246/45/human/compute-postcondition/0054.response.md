`group` is appended with the value of `num`. The initial state indicates that `groups` must contain at least one element, but since `group` is mentioned instead of `groups`, it implies that `group` is a list. After appending `num` to `group`, the length of `group` increases by 1. The output state is: `group` contains all its previous elements plus `num`.

Output State: **`group` contains all its previous elements plus `num`**
