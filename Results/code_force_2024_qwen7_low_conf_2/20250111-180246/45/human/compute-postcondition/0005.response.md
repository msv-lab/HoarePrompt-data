According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, meaning it was greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer equal to the input value.
- `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
- The output is the return value of `func_2(n, integers)`.

At the start of the next iteration, `t` should be decreased by 1, and it must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)**.
