Let's analyze the given loop and the provided output states to understand the final state of the variables after the loop executes all its iterations.

### Loop Code:
```python
for group in groups:
    if func_1(num, group[0]):
        group.append(num)
        placed = True
        break
```

### Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `integers` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element.
   - `groups` is a list containing all the elements from `integers` where `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluated to `True` for some group in `groups`.
   - `num` is set to one of the elements from `integers`.
   - `placed` is `False`.
   - `group` is not modified.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each group in `groups`.
   - For each group, it checks if `func_1(num, group[0])` is `True`.
   - If `func_1(num, group[0])` is `True`, `num` is appended to `group`, and `placed` is set to `True`.
   - The loop breaks immediately after this operation, so no further checks are performed for other groups.

### Output State After All Iterations:

- **If the loop executes at least once**: 
  - `placed` will be `True` because `num` will be appended to one of the groups.
  - `groups` will contain at least one group that has `num` appended to it.
  - `num` will retain its original value from the initial state.
  
- **If the loop does not execute (i.e., `func_1(num, group[0])` is `False` for all groups)**:
  - `placed` remains `False`.
  - `groups` remains unchanged.
  - `num` retains its original value from the initial state.

Given the above analysis, we can conclude the following output state:

Output State: **`groups` contains at least one group with `num` appended to it if the loop executed, `placed` is `True` in this case. If the loop did not execute, `placed` is `False` and `groups` remains unchanged. `num` retains its original value from the initial state.**
