Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Current States:**
   - `n`: A positive integer (already given).
   - `integers`: A list of non-negative integers with at least one element (already given).
   - `groups`: A list containing elements from `integers` where `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluated to `True` for some group in `groups` (already given).
   - `num`: Set to one of the elements from `integers` (already given).
   - `placed`: `False` (already given).
   - `group`: Not modified (already given).

2. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each `group` in `groups`.
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `groups`.

3. **Check the Initial State of the Loop Variable:**
   - The loop variable is `group`, and since we don't know the specific value of `group` at the start of the loop, we only need to ensure that `groups` is not empty.

4. **Ensure the Correct State for the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `groups` must contain at least one element.

5. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Execution:**
   - Since `num` and `placed` are not directly related to the loop execution but rather to the loop body, they do not need to be explicitly adjusted here.
   - We need to ensure `groups` contains at least one element to allow the loop to start.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`groups` must contain at least one element**.
