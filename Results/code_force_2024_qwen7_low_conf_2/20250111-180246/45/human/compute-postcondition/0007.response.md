The code reads a list of integers from input and assigns it to the variable `integers`. The previous value of `t` is a positive integer - 1, and `n` is an input integer. After executing the code, `integers` will be updated to the list of integers provided by the input.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we can represent the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)**
