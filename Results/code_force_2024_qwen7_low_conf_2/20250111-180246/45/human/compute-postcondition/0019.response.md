Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `integers` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `groups` is a list containing all the elements from `integers` where `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluated to `True` for some group in `groups`, `num` is the last integer from `integers` processed, `placed` is `True`, and `group` is the last group from `groups` where `num` was appended. If no elements from `integers` satisfy `func_1(num, group[0])`, then `groups` remains empty, `num` is not set, `placed` is `False`, and `group` is not modified.**
