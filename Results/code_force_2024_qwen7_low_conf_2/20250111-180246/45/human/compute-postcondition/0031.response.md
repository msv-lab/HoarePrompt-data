According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `groups`. The loop continues as long as `groups` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `groups` contains at least one element, `num` retains its original integer value, and `placed` is set to `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `False`, the values of `groups`, `num`, and `placed` remain unchanged from the precondition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `groups` must still contain at least one element. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True` for the first element in `groups`, the loop will continue. Otherwise, the values of `groups`, `num`, and `placed` will remain unchanged.

Since we need to consider both cases (where `func_1(num, group[0])` is `True` or `False`), we'll describe the state assuming the loop will continue:

State: **`groups` contains at least one element, `num` retains its original integer value, and `placed` is set to `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `False`, the values of `groups`, `num`, and `placed` remain unchanged from the precondition.**
