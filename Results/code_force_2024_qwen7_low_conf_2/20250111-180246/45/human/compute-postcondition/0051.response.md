The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or block we are inside, but it does not change the values of any variables. The conditions and values of `groups`, `num`, `func_1(num, group[0])`, and `placed` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`groups` must contain at least one element and now also contains `num`, `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True; `placed` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
