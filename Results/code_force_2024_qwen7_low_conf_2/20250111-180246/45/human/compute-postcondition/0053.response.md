According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `groups`. The loop iterates over each `group` in `groups`. At the end of the previous iteration, `groups` must contain at least one element. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more elements in `groups` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions must hold:
- `groups` must contain at least one element.
- Either `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True, in which case `placed` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part, so the state remains as it was before the if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `groups` must still contain at least one element. Since there are no additional constraints given about `placed` or `num` that would prevent the loop from continuing, we only need to ensure that `groups` still contains at least one element.

State: **`groups` must contain at least one element**
