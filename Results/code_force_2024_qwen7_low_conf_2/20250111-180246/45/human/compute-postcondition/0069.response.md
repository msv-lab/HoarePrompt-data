The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `integers`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of integers.
- `integers` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).

The function returns the length of the list `groups`, which contains all integers from `integers` according to a specified condition, and `placed` is `True` for each iteration.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `integers`, and return the length of the list `groups` containing integers from `integers` under a certain condition, with `placed` being `True` for each iteration.
