Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `integers` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `groups` is a list containing all the elements from `integers` where `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluated to `True` for some group in `groups`, `num` is not set, `placed` is `False`, and `group` is not modified. This is true regardless of whether `not placed` evaluates to `True` or `False`, as there is no modification of these variables in either case of the if-else statement.***
