Postcondition: **`groups` contains at least one group with `num` appended to it if the loop executed, `placed` is `True` in this case. If the loop did not execute, `placed` is `False` and `groups` remains unchanged. `num` retains its original value from the initial state. If the if condition is met (i.e., `placed` is `False`), then `groups` contains at least two groups, one of which is `[num]`.**
