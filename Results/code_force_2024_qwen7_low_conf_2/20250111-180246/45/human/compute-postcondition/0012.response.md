The code `print(func_2(n, integers))` calls the function `func_2` with the arguments `n` and `integers`. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact output of the function. Since the function call does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `integers`, these variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a new input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
