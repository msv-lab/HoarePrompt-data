`n` is reassigned the value of `int(input())`. The previous value of `n` was an input integer, and now it is reassigned to a new integer input. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list `integers` is unaffected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a new input integer, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)**
