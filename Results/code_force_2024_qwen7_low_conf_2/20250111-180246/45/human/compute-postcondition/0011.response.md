The code takes a list of integers as input from the user and converts it into a list using the `map` function and `int`. The input is split by spaces, which means each integer entered by the user will be separated by spaces. This changes the value of `integers` from a list of `n` non-negative integers (where `n` is the value of `n`) to a list of integers obtained from the input. 

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a new input integer, and `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, the code will read a line of input, split it by spaces, and convert each string in the resulting list to an integer. After this operation, the `integers` list will be updated with these new integer values.

Since the exact input values are not specified, we will represent the final state of `integers` as a list of integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a new input integer, `integers` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
