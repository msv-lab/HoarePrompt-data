`groups.append([num])` appends a new list containing only `num` to the `groups` list. Since `num` is not set initially, the new list added to `groups` will be `[None]`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `integers` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `groups` is a list containing all the elements from `integers` where `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluated to `True` for some group in `groups` and now includes `[None]`, `num` is not set, `placed` is `False`, and `group` is not modified.**
