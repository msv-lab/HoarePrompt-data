Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `integers`. It processes `integers` by grouping the numbers based on a condition specified by `func_1`. Specifically, for each number in `integers`, it checks if the number can be added to any existing group in `groups` (where each group is initialized with a specific starting number). If a suitable group is found, the number is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created. After processing all numbers, the function returns the total number of groups formed. The annotation stating that `placed` is `True` for each iteration might be misleading since the variable `placed` is only used within the loop to check if a number was added to a group, and its value is not reflected in the final output.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `integers` is empty, the function will return 0 because no groups are formed.
- If all numbers in `integers` satisfy the condition `func_1(num, group[0])` when checked against the same group's starting number, they will all end up in the same group, resulting in only one group being formed.
- If none of the numbers satisfy the condition when checked against any existing group's starting number, each number will form its own separate group, resulting in `n` groups.
