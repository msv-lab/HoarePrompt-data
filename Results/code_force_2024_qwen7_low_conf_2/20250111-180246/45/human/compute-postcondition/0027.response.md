The code `group.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the list `group`. Since `group` initially contains at least one element (`group[0]`), after appending `num`, `group` will now contain two elements: the first element remains unchanged (still `group[0]`), and the second element is `num`.

Therefore, the output state is: `groups` now contains `[group[0], num]`; `num` retains its original integer value.

Output State: **`groups` now contains `[group[0], num]`; `num` retains its original integer value.**
