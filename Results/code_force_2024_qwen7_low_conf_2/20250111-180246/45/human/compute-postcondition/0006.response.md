`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `integers` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)**
