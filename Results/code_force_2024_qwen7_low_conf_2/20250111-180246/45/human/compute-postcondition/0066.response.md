Postcondition: ***`groups` contains at least one group plus a new group `[num]`. `placed` is `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True` for at least one group, and `num` is its original value from the initial state. This holds true whether or not the if condition `not placed` is met, as there is no else part that changes this state.***
