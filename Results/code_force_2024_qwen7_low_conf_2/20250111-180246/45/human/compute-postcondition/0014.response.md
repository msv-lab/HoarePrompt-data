The function `func_3` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it operates on global variables `t` and `n`, which are integers such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, respectively. Additionally, it takes a list called `integers` as an input, which contains `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

However, following the format and constraints given in the example, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers named `integers`, and operates using global variables `t` and `n` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`. No return value is specified.**
