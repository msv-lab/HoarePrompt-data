The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block but does not change the values of variables outside of that block. Since the `break` statement is not within any loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, it will simply exit the context it is in (which is implied to be the current block of code), without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`groups` contains at least one element plus the value of `num`, and `placed` is `True`.**
