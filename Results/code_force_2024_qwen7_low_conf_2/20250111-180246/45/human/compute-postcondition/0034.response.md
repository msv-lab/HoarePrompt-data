The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only causes the program to exit the current loop or the most nested block it is in. Since there is no loop or block structure in the given code snippet, the `break` statement simply ends the current context without altering the values of `groups`, `num`, or `placed`.

Output State: **`groups` contains at least one element plus `num`, `num` retains its original integer value, and `placed` is `True`.**
