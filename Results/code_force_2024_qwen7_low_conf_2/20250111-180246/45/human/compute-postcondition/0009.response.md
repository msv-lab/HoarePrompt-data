According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer - 1, meaning `t` was initially set to some positive integer value and has been decremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)**
