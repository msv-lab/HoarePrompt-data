The function `func_2(n, integers)` is called, but its implementation is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of the variables after the function call without knowing what the function does. However, we know that `n` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer - 1, and `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). The function call itself does not change these values.

Since the function's implementation is not provided, we can only say that the function was called with the given arguments and printed the result. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `integers` remains the same.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), and the result of `func_2(n, integers)` is printed.**
