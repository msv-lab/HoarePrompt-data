Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State:
- `groups` contains at least one group with `num` appended to it if the loop executed, or `groups` remains unchanged if the loop did not execute.
- `placed` is `False`.
- `num` retains its original value from the initial state.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is:
```
for group in groups:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **`groups`**: The loop will only execute if `groups` contains at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `groups` has at least one element before the loop starts.
2. **`placed`**: The variable `placed` is irrelevant to the loop condition itself. However, it could affect what happens inside the loop body. For the purpose of determining if the loop should execute, `placed` does not need to be adjusted.
3. **`num`**: The value of `num` is already described as retaining its original value from the initial state. This means no change is needed for `num`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute, `groups` must contain at least one element. Since `groups` must contain at least one group, this condition is sufficient to determine if the loop will run.

### Final State:
State: **`groups` must contain at least one element**.
