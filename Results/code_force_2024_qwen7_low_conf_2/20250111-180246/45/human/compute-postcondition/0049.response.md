The code `group.append(num)` adds the value of `num` to the list `group`. Since `groups` must contain at least one element, and `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True, the structure and truth value of this condition remain unchanged. The variable `num` remains unchanged as well.

After executing the code, the list `group` will have one additional element, which is `num`.

Output State: **`groups` must contain at least one element and now also contains `num`, `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to True**
