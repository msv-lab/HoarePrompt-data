The provided code snippet calls a function `func_2(n, integers)` and prints its return value. However, the definition of `func_2` is not provided. Since the function's behavior is not specified, we cannot determine the exact output. Nevertheless, we can describe the state after the print statement based on the initial conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer
- `n` is an integer equal to the input value
- `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)

After executing the code:
- The function `func_2(n, integers)` is called.
- Its return value is printed.

Since we do not know the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot specify what exactly gets printed. However, we can say that the output is the return value of `func_2(n, integers)`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to the input value, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), and the output is the return value of `func_2(n, integers)`**
