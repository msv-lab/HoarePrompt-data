Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `integers` is a list of non-negative integers with at least one element, `groups` is a list containing all the elements from `integers` where `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluated to `True` for some group in `groups`, `num` is not set, `placed` is `False`, and `group` is not modified.***

Explanation: Since the condition `(not placed)` is true, the postcondition includes all the details from the precondition and explicitly states that `num` is not set, `placed` is `False`, and `group` is not modified as per the if condition.
