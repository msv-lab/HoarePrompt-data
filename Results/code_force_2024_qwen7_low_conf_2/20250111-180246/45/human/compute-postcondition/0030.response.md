Postcondition: ***`groups` contains at least one element, `num` retains its original integer value, and `placed` is set to `True` if `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `True`. If `func_1(num, group[0])` evaluates to `False`, the values of `groups`, `num`, and `placed` remain unchanged from the precondition.***
