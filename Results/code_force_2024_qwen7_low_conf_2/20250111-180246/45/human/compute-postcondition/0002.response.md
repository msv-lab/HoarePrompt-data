The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into an integer, assigning this value to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged because the input is not related to `t`, and the list `integers` is also not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (at least 1), `n` is an integer equal to the input value, and `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).**
