### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the provided functions and the logic behind them to ensure the program meets the requirements and specifications given in the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Correctly checks if two numbers have different bits at every position from 1 to 31 using bitwise operations. This function ensures that the condition for grouping numbers is met.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic for grouping numbers seems sound. However, there is a critical issue in the implementation. The function `func_2` iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group where the numbers in that group do not violate the condition checked by `func_1`. This part of the logic is correct. However, the issue lies in how the groups are managed and how the bit comparison is handled.

   - Specifically, the function `func_2` appends the number to a group only if the condition is satisfied. But it does not ensure that the groups themselves are maintained correctly. If a number cannot fit into any existing group, a new group is created. However, this approach does not guarantee that the minimum number of groups is used. In some cases, numbers might fit into an existing group but are incorrectly placed in a new group due to the way the function handles the conditions.

   - Another issue is the handling of the bit comparison. The function `func_1` is correctly checking the bits, but the way the function `func_2` is using this information might lead to suboptimal grouping.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Correctly reads input and processes each test case by calling `func_2` and printing the result.

Given the above analysis, while the logic in `func_2` seems sound in theory, the practical implementation has issues that could lead to incorrect or inefficient grouping of numbers. The function does not ensure that the minimum number of groups is used and might create unnecessary groups.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed reasoning, the provided program is not guaranteed to produce the correct minimum number of groups in all cases due to the issues in `func_2`.

**Final:** **False**
