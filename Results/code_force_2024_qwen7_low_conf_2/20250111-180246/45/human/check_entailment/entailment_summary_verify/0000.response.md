### Reasoning:

1. **Grouping Logic**:
   - The `func_1` function checks if two numbers have the same bit in any position from 1 to 31. It does this by shifting the bits and comparing the least significant bit at each step. This logic is correct and ensures that if two numbers have the same bit in any position, `func_1` will return `False`.

2. **Group Assignment**:
   - The `func_2` function attempts to place each number into an existing group that satisfies the condition from `func_1`. If no such group exists, it creates a new group. This approach ensures that the numbers are grouped correctly based on the bit condition.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_3` function reads the input and processes each test case independently. It correctly calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some edge cases and assumptions that could lead to incorrect behavior:

- **Edge Case Analysis**:
  - The problem specifies that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`. This means that while the individual `n` values can be up to `2·10^5`, the total number of integers across all test cases cannot exceed `2·10^5`.
  - The `func_2` function does not handle cases where the input list `integers` is empty or contains only one element. In such cases, `func_2` would still return `[0]` as the number of groups, which is not necessarily correct.
  - The function summaries indicate that the program should handle invalid inputs, but there is no explicit check for such cases in the provided code.

- **Potential Issues**:
  - **Empty or Single Element Input**: If `n` is 0 or 1, `func_2` should return 0 or 1, respectively, rather than creating a group with `[0]`.
  - **Bitwise Grouping**: While the logic for checking bit equality is correct, there is no mechanism to ensure that the minimum number of groups is actually achieved. For example, if all numbers have the same set of bits, they should all be in the same group, but the current implementation might create multiple groups unnecessarily.

### Conclusion:

While the provided program logic appears to be correct for most cases, there are potential issues with handling edge cases and ensuring the minimum number of groups is achieved. The current implementation might not handle all scenarios optimally, especially for very large inputs.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The program is generally correct but requires additional validation and handling of edge cases to ensure optimal performance and accuracy in all scenarios.
