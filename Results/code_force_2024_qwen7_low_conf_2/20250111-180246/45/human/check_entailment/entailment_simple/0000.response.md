Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function `func_1(x, y)`**:
   - This function checks whether the i-th bit of `x` and `y` is different for all `i` from 1 to 31.
   - It iterates through each bit position from 1 to 31, shifting the bits of `x` and `y` to check if they match.
   - If any bit position matches, the function returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, integers)`**:
   - This function divides the list of integers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits at any position from 1 to 31.
   - It initializes an empty list `groups` to store the groups.
   - For each integer in the input list, it tries to place it in an existing group using `func_1`.
     - If the integer can be added to an existing group (i.e., no matching bits with the first integer in the group), it is appended to that group.
     - If it cannot be added to any existing group, a new group is created with this integer.
   - Finally, it returns the number of groups formed.

3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers.
   - It calls `func_2(n, integers)` and prints the result.

### Validation Against Problem Description:

- **Input Handling**: 
  - The program correctly reads the input as described (number of test cases, number of integers, and the list of integers).
  - It handles the constraints on `t`, `n`, and the integers.

- **Group Formation**:
  - The program ensures that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit at any position from 1 to 31, as required by the problem.
  - The function `func_1` checks this condition correctly.
  - The function `func_2` ensures that numbers are grouped appropriately.

- **Output**:
  - The program outputs the minimum number of groups required for each test case, which is the length of the `groups` list returned by `func_2`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and follows the problem description without any discrepancies, the program is correct.
