You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y < 2^31.
def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, 32):
        if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 32, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x < 2^{31}\), `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y < 2^{31}\), and the function returns True if and only if all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of `x` and `y` are identical.
    return True
    #The program returns True if and only if all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of x and y are identical

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and integers is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_2(n, integers):
    groups = []
    for num in integers:
        placed = False
        
        for group in groups:
            if func_1(num, group[0]):
                group.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        
        if not placed:
            groups.append([num])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `groups` is a list of lists where each inner list contains non-negative integers from `integers` such that each integer in an inner list satisfies `func_1(num, group[0])` for that list, `placed` is `False` and `num` retains its original value from the initial state if the loop did not execute for any integer in `integers`. If the loop executed for all integers, then `groups` contains all integers from `integers` according to the specified condition and `placed` is `True` for each iteration.
    return len(groups)
    #The program returns the length of the list `groups` which contains all integers from `integers` according to the specified condition and `placed` is `True` for each iteration

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and integers is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than 2^31.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(func_2(n, integers))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to the last input value, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), and the output consists of the return values of `func_2(n, integers)` for each iteration of the loop.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
