You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y < 2^31.

    return True
    #The program returns True if and only if all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of x and y are identical
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both constrained such that \(0 \leq x, y < 2^{31}\). It checks whether all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of `x` and `y` are identical. If any bit differs, the function returns `False`. If all bits from position 0 to position 30 are identical, the function returns `True`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and integers is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `groups` is a list of lists where each inner list contains non-negative integers from `integers` such that each integer in an inner list satisfies `func_1(num, group[0])` for that list, `placed` is `False` and `num` retains its original value from the initial state if the loop did not execute for any integer in `integers`. If the loop executed for all integers, then `groups` contains all integers from `integers` according to the specified condition and `placed` is `True` for each iteration.
    return len(groups)
    #The program returns the length of the list `groups` which contains all integers from `integers` according to the specified condition and `placed` is `True` for each iteration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `integers`. It processes `integers` by grouping the numbers based on a condition specified by `func_1`. Specifically, for each number in `integers`, it checks if the number can be added to any existing group in `groups` (where each group is initialized with a specific starting number). If a suitable group is found, the number is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created. After processing all numbers, the function returns the total number of groups formed. The annotation stating that `placed` is `True` for each iteration might be misleading since the variable `placed` is only used within the loop to check if a number was added to a group, and its value is not reflected in the final output.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and integers is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than 2^31.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(func_2(n, integers))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to the last input value, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), and the output consists of the return values of `func_2(n, integers)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers, then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs. It prints the result returned by `func_2` for each test case. The function does not specify any return value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printing the results of calling `func_2` for each one. If any input values exceed their specified ranges (e.g., `t > 10^4`, `n > 2·10^5`, or integers not being less than \(2^{31}\)), the program will raise a ValueError. Additionally, if `func_2` is called with invalid arguments, the program may behave unpredictably unless `func_2` itself handles such cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The `func_1` function checks if two numbers differ in all 31 bits. The `func_2` function uses this check to group numbers such that no two numbers within the same group have matching bits in any position from 1 to 31. Finally, `func_3` processes the input and prints the minimum number of groups required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases as required:

1. **Grouping Logic**: The `func_1` function correctly identifies whether two numbers have different bits in each corresponding position. This ensures that if two numbers have the same bit in any position, they will not be placed in the same group.
2. **Group Assignment**: The `func_2` function iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group. If no suitable group is found, a new group is created. This ensures that each number is placed in a group where no other number has the same bit in any position.
3. **Input Handling**: The `func_3` function handles multiple test cases, reading input and processing each test case independently.

Since the logic seems sound and covers all necessary conditions, the program is correct. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
