### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if two integers `x` and `y` have the same bit in every position from 1 to 31. The logic is correct because:
     - The loop iterates from 1 to 31.
     - `x >> i - 1 & 1` extracts the `i-th` bit of `x`.
     - `y >> i - 1 & 1` extracts the `i-th` bit of `y`.
     - If any of these bits are the same, the function returns `False`.
     - If all bits are different, the function returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit in any position.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - Initialize an empty list `groups`.
     - For each number in `integers`, try to place it in an existing group using `func_1`.
     - If the number can be placed in an existing group, append it to that group.
     - If no group can accommodate the number, create a new group.
     - Return the number of groups.
   - The logic here is correct because:
     - The `for group in groups:` loop ensures that each number is checked against all existing groups.
     - If a group exists that can accommodate the number (i.e., `func_1` returns `True`), the number is added to that group.
     - If no such group exists, a new group is created.
   - However, the annotation stating that `placed` is `True` for each iteration might be misleading. `placed` is only set to `True` if a number is successfully added to a group. Its value is not reflected in the final output, but the function still returns the correct number of groups.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads multiple test cases and processes each one.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, the number of integers `n` for each test case, and the list of integers.
   - It then calls `func_2` to determine the minimum number of groups required for each test case and prints the result.
   - The logic is correct as long as the input values are within the specified ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each integer is less than \(2^{31}\)).

### Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The `func_1` function accurately checks if two numbers have the same bit in each position. The `func_2` function correctly groups numbers based on this check, and `func_3` handles the input and output as required.

There are no identified issues or edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem statement.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct.
