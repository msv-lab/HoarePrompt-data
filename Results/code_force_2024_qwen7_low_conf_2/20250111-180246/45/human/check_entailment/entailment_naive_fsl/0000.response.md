Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The `func_1` function checks if two numbers differ in all 31 bits. The `func_2` function uses this check to group numbers such that no two numbers within the same group have matching bits in any position from 1 to 31. Finally, `func_3` processes the input and prints the minimum number of groups required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all potential cases as required:

1. **Grouping Logic**: The `func_1` function correctly identifies whether two numbers have different bits in each corresponding position. This ensures that if two numbers have the same bit in any position, they will not be placed in the same group.
2. **Group Assignment**: The `func_2` function iterates through each number and tries to place it in an existing group. If no suitable group is found, a new group is created. This ensures that each number is placed in a group where no other number has the same bit in any position.
3. **Input Handling**: The `func_3` function handles multiple test cases, reading input and processing each test case independently.

Since the logic seems sound and covers all necessary conditions, the program is correct. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
