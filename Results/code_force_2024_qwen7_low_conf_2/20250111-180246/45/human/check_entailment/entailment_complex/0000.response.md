Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of two integers `x` and `y` are identical. It iterates through all 31 bits and returns `False` if any bit matches. If no bits match, it returns `True`.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly groups the integers such that no two integers in the same group share the same bit in positions 1 to 31. It uses `func_1` to determine whether a number can be added to an existing group or if a new group needs to be created. The logic of checking and appending to groups ensures that the constraint is met.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function correctly reads input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_2`, and prints the results. The overall flow and handling of input/output are correct for the problem statement.

Given the descriptions and the logical structure of the functions, the program meets the requirements of the problem:

- The program correctly reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it correctly determines the minimum number of groups required to ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit in positions 1 to 31.
- The output is correct and matches the expected format.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
