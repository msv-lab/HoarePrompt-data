### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step using the annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Annotation**: Checks if two numbers `x` and `y` have different bits in each corresponding position from 1 to 31.
- **Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  def func_1(x, y):
      for i in range(1, 32):
          if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:
              return False
      return True
  ```
  - The function shifts both `x` and `y` to the right by `i-1` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with `1`. If the result is the same for both `x` and `y`, it means the `i-th` bit is the same. If this happens for any `i`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Annotation**: Groups numbers such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit in any position.
- **Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  def func_2(n, integers):
      groups = []
      for num in integers:
          placed = False
          for group in groups:
              if func_1(num, group[0]):
                  group.append(num)
                  placed = True
                  break
          if not placed:
              groups.append([num])
      return len(groups)
  ```
  - The function initializes an empty list `groups` to store the groups of numbers.
  - For each number `num` in `integers`, it tries to place it in an existing group by calling `func_1(num, group[0])`. If `num` and `group[0]` have different bits in all positions, it appends `num` to the group and marks `placed` as `True`.
  - If no suitable group is found, a new group containing `num` is created.
  - Finally, the function returns the number of groups formed.

#### Function `func_3`:
- **Annotation**: Handles multiple test cases by processing each test case independently.
- **Code Analysis**:
  ```python
  def func_3():
      t = int(input())
      for _ in range(t):
          n = int(input())
          integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
          print(func_2(n, integers))
  ```
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `n` integers.
  - It then calls `func_2(n, integers)` and prints the result.

### Systematic Evaluation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State**: `func_3` starts with `t` test cases.
- **Test Case Processing**:
  - `func_3` reads `n` and the list of `n` integers for each test case.
  - `func_2` is called with these inputs to determine the minimum number of groups required.
  - The logic in `func_2` correctly checks if numbers can be grouped based on their bit differences and assigns them to appropriate groups.
  - The final result is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
- **Function `func_1`** correctly checks if two numbers have the same bit in any position.
- **Function `func_2`** correctly groups numbers based on the bit difference condition.
- **Function `func_3`** correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case independently.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The provided code meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Final:
**True**
