You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks whether two numbers `x` and `y` have different bits at every position from 1 to 31.
   - It iterates through each bit position from 1 to 31 and uses bitwise operations to check if the `i-th` bit of both numbers is the same.
   - If any bit is the same, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to group the integers such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit value at any position from 1 to 31.
   - It initializes an empty list `groups` to store the groups.
   - It iterates through each number in `integers`.
   - For each number, it tries to place it in an existing group where the numbers in that group do not violate the condition checked by `func_1`.
   - If a suitable group is found, the number is added to that group, and `placed` is set to `True`.
   - If no suitable group is found, a new group is created with the current number.
   - Finally, it returns the number of groups formed.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_2` and prints the result.

### Verification:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic is correct. It correctly checks if the bits at every position from 1 to 31 are different between the two numbers.
   - This function ensures that the condition for grouping numbers is met.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic for grouping numbers is sound. It attempts to place each number in an existing group that satisfies the condition.
   - If no such group exists, it creates a new group. This approach ensures that the minimum number of groups is used.
   - The implementation correctly handles the requirement that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit at any position.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The structure of reading input and processing each test case is correct.
   - It correctly calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and should work as expected according to the problem statement.
