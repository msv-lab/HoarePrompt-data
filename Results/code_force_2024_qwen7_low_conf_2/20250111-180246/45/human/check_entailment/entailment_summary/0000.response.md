### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires us to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit at any of the 31 least significant positions.
   - We need to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy this condition.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if two numbers have the same bit at each of the 31 positions. If any bit position matches, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - **func_2**: This function groups numbers based on the condition checked by `func_1`. For each number, it tries to add it to an existing group where no bit positions match. If no such group exists, it creates a new group. The function returns the total number of groups formed.
   - **func_3**: This function reads input and calls `func_2` for each test case, printing the result. It ensures that the input is read correctly and handles multiple test cases.

3. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - **func_1** is implemented correctly and accurately checks the bit condition.
   - **func_2** logic is sound: it iterates through each number and attempts to place it in an existing group or creates a new group if necessary. The function correctly returns the number of groups.
   - **func_3** correctly reads inputs, calls `func_2` for each test case, and prints the results. It handles multiple test cases and input validation.

Given that all functions are implemented correctly and logically consistent with the problem statement, the overall program should work as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
