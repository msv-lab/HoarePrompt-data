def func_1(x, y):
    for i in range(1, 32):
        if x >> i - 1 & 1 == y >> i - 1 & 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is 32, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x < 2^{31}\), `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y < 2^{31}\), and the function returns True if and only if all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of `x` and `y` are identical.
    return True
    #The program returns True if and only if all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of x and y are identical
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `x` and `y`, both constrained such that \(0 \leq x, y < 2^{31}\). It checks whether all corresponding bits from position 0 to position 30 of `x` and `y` are identical. If any bit differs, the function returns `False`. If all bits from position 0 to position 30 are identical, the function returns `True`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and integers is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_2(n, integers):
    groups = []
    for num in integers:
        placed = False
        
        for group in groups:
            if func_1(num, group[0]):
                group.append(num)
                placed = True
                break
        
        if not placed:
            groups.append([num])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `groups` is a list of lists where each inner list contains non-negative integers from `integers` such that each integer in an inner list satisfies `func_1(num, group[0])` for that list, `placed` is `False` and `num` retains its original value from the initial state if the loop did not execute for any integer in `integers`. If the loop executed for all integers, then `groups` contains all integers from `integers` according to the specified condition and `placed` is `True` for each iteration.
    return len(groups)
    #The program returns the length of the list `groups` which contains all integers from `integers` according to the specified condition and `placed` is `True` for each iteration
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `integers`. It processes `integers` by grouping the numbers based on a condition specified by `func_1`. Specifically, for each number in `integers`, it checks if the number can be added to any existing group in `groups` (where each group is initialized with a specific starting number). If a suitable group is found, the number is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created. After processing all numbers, the function returns the total number of groups formed. The annotation stating that `placed` is `True` for each iteration might be misleading since the variable `placed` is only used within the loop to check if a number was added to a group, and its value is not reflected in the final output.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and integers is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than 2^31.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        integers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(func_2(n, integers))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer equal to the last input value, `integers` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\), and the output consists of the return values of `func_2(n, integers)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers, then calls another function `func_2` with these inputs. It prints the result returned by `func_2` for each test case. The function does not specify any return value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printing the results of calling `func_2` for each one. If any input values exceed their specified ranges (e.g., `t > 10^4`, `n > 2·10^5`, or integers not being less than \(2^{31}\)), the program will raise a ValueError. Additionally, if `func_2` is called with invalid arguments, the program may behave unpredictably unless `func_2` itself handles such cases.
