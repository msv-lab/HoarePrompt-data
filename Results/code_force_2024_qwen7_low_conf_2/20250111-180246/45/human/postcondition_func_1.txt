The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of non-negative integers `integers`. It processes `integers` by grouping the numbers based on a condition specified by `func_1`. Specifically, for each number in `integers`, it checks if the number can be added to any existing group in `groups` (where each group is initialized with a specific starting number). If a suitable group is found, the number is appended to that group; otherwise, a new group is created. After processing all numbers, the function returns the total number of groups formed. The annotation stating that `placed` is `True` for each iteration might be misleading since the variable `placed` is only used within the loop to check if a number was added to a group, and its value is not reflected in the final output.
