Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `x` and `y`. This aligns with the requirement that there will be `t` pairs of integers as input.

2. **Output Generation**: For each test case, the program calculates the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`, and prints them in the required format. Specifically, it prints the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each pair of integers.

3. **Loop Execution**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate `t` times, processing each pair of integers one by one. This ensures that the program handles all `t` test cases as specified.

4. **Input Validity Assumption**: As per the problem description, the assumption is made that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. The program does not explicitly handle cases where the input might be invalid (e.g., non-integer inputs, negative values, etc.), but this is acceptable under the given constraints.

Since the annotated program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description and handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.
