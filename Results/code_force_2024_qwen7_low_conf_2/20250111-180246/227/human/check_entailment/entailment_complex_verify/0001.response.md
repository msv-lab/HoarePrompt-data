### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - This is correctly handled, and `t` is constrained to be between 1 and 100, inclusive.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
   - In each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum and maximum values using the `min()` and `max()` functions.
   - It prints the results as required, with the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value.

3. **Handling Constraints:**
   - The values of `x` and `y` are constrained to be between 0 and 9, inclusive.
   - The program ensures these constraints are respected, as it does not perform any checks other than reading the values directly.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.
   - Each test case correctly outputs the minimum and maximum values as specified.

5. **State Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - After the loop, `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user if `t > 0`.
   - If `t = 0`, the loop does not execute, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly, including when `t = 0` and when `x` and `y` are equal.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the specified functionality.
