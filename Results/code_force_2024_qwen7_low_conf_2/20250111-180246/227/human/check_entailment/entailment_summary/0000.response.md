Reasoning:
- The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `x` and `y` for each test case.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` using the built-in functions `min()` and `max()`, respectively.
- It then prints these values.
- The logic within the loop is correct and should produce the expected output for each test case.
- The values of `x` and `y` after the loop do not affect the output because the loop only processes the pairs for the test cases and does not rely on their final values.
- The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program without any contradictions or errors.

Correctness: **True**
