Reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates `t` times, where for each iteration:
   - It reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the minimum of `x` and `y` using `min(x, y)` and the maximum of `x` and `y` using `max(x, y)`.
   - It prints the result as required, with the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value.
3. The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.
4. The constraints for `t` and the values of `x` and `y` are handled appropriately within the given ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the specified functionality.

Correctness: **True**
