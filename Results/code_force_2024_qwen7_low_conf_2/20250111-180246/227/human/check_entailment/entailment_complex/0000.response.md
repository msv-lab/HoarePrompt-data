Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and ensures that `t` is within the valid range (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- For each test case, the program correctly reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and prints the minimum and maximum of these integers.
- The program handles the case when `t` is 0 by not executing the loop and leaving `x` and `y` unchanged.
- The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
