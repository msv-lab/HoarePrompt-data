You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - \( t \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \).
    #- \( x \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq x \leq 9 \).
    #- \( y \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq y \leq 9 \).
    #- If \( t > 0 \), the loop processes \( t \) pairs of integers and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After all iterations, \( x \) and \( y \) will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.
    #- If \( t = 0 \), the loop does not execute, and the values of \( x \) and \( y \) remain as they were in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After processing all test cases, if `t` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
