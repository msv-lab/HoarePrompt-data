You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(x, y), max(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After processing all test cases, if `t` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program starts by reading an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates `t` times, where for each iteration:
   - It reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the minimum of `x` and `y` using `min(x, y)` and the maximum of `x` and `y` using `max(x, y)`.
   - It prints the result as required, with the minimum value first, followed by the maximum value.
3. The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.
4. The constraints for `t` and the values of `x` and `y` are handled appropriately within the given ranges (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the specified functionality.

Correctness: **True**
