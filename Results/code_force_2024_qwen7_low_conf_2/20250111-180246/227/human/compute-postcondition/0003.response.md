The code prints the minimum and maximum of the two input integers `x` and `y`. Since the actual values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state, we will represent them as placeholders and then determine their minimum and maximum values.

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9 and `x` is updated to the first input integer, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9 and `y` is updated to the second input integer

After the code runs, the values of `x` and `y` are printed as the minimum and maximum of the two numbers. Let's assume the inputs for `x` and `y` are provided (for example, `x = 5` and `y = 7`):

- If `x = 5` and `y = 7`, then `min(x, y) = 5` and `max(x, y) = 7`.
- If `x = 7` and `y = 5`, then `min(x, y) = 5` and `max(x, y) = 7`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we will represent the output as general values:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and the output is the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.**
