`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which reads an integer input from the user. The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, as per the initial state. The variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9**
