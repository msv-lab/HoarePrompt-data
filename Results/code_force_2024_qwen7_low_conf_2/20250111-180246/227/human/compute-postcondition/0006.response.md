The code `print(min(x, y), max(x, y))` does not change the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `t`. Instead, it prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the print statement executes.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` are printed.**
