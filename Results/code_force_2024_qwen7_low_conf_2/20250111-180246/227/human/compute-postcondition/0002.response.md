`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t` and `x` (which is now one of the inputs) are updated, while `y` (the second input) remains unchanged. The initial conditions that `t` must be greater than 0 and `x` and `y` must be between 0 and 9 are still valid.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9 and `x` is updated to the first input integer, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9 and `y` is updated to the second input integer**
