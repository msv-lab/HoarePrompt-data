The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial conditions are that `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and `y` is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). After executing this code, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated to the integers entered by the user, but their constraints remain the same. The output is the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`, but since the input values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact minimum and maximum without user input. However, we know that the values of `x` and `y` are now updated.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers entered by the user.**
