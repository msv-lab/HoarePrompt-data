Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After processing all test cases, if `t` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user. If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This summary covers the following points:
1. The function does not take any parameters.
2. It processes `t` pairs of integers where `t` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.
3. For each pair, it prints the minimum and maximum values.
4. If `t` is 0, no pairs are processed, and `x` and `y` retain their initial values.
5. If `t` is greater than 0, `x` and `y` will hold the values of the last pair after the loop completes.
