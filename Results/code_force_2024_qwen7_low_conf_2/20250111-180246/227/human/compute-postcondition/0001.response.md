According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9.
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. Since the range function in Python includes the start value but excludes the stop value, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9**
