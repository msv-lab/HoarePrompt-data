The code prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are determined by the input, but their specific values are not given. The print function does not assign any value to a variable, it only outputs the values. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer equal to the first number input, `y` is an integer equal to the second number input**
