Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 9\).
   - `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq 9\).
   - The minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` are printed.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `t-1`.
   - Each iteration of the loop prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine what changes need to occur for the loop to execute one more time.
   - Since `t` is the number of iterations, and it is initially greater than 1, we need to ensure that `t` is still greater than 1 after the current iteration.

4. **Modifying the State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must remain greater than 1.
   - The values of `x` and `y` should remain within their respective bounds (\(0 \leq x \leq 9\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 9\)) because they do not change within the loop body (as indicated by "the loop body is omit").
   - The minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` are already determined and printed during each iteration, so no additional constraints are needed for these variables.

5. **Final State**:
   - To execute the loop one more time, `t` must still be greater than 1.
   - `x` and `y` remain within their bounds.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 9\), `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq 9\)**.
