The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the given code snippet. However, based on the constraints provided, it seems the function might internally use variables `t`, `x`, and `y` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9. 

Given the provided output cases, it appears the function returns different values based on the conditions applied to these internal variables.
