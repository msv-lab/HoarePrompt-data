According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9
- `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9
- The output is the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0. The values of `x` and `y` do not change within the loop itself, so they remain as they were in the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 9, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ 9, and the output is the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`**
