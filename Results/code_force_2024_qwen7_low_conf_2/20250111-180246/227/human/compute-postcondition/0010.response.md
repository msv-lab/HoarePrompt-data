Let's analyze the loop step-by-step to determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State:
- \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)
- \( x \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq x \leq 9 \)
- \( y \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq y \leq 9 \)

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(x, y), max(x, y))
```

### Analysis:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute at least once if \( t > 0 \).
   - After the first iteration, \( x \) and \( y \) will be set to the values of the first pair of integers entered by the user.
   - The minimum and maximum of these two numbers will be printed.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - The loop will execute at least twice if \( t > 1 \).
   - After the second iteration, \( x \) and \( y \) will be set to the values of the second pair of integers entered by the user.
   - The minimum and maximum of these two numbers will be printed.

3. **General Case**:
   - After \( n \) iterations (where \( n \leq t \)), \( x \) and \( y \) will be set to the values of the \( n \)-th pair of integers entered by the user.
   - The minimum and maximum of these two numbers will be printed.

4. **Final State**:
   - After \( t \) iterations (if \( t > 0 \)):
     - \( x \) and \( y \) will be set to the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.
     - The minimum and maximum of these two numbers will be printed.
   - If \( t = 0 \), the loop will not execute, and the values of \( x \) and \( y \) will remain as they were in the initial state.

### Conclusion:

The loop processes \( t \) pairs of integers and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After all iterations, \( x \) and \( y \) will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.

**Output State:**
- \( t \) is a non-negative integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \).
- \( x \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq x \leq 9 \).
- \( y \) is an integer such that \( 0 \leq y \leq 9 \).
- If \( t > 0 \), the loop processes \( t \) pairs of integers and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After all iterations, \( x \) and \( y \) will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user.
- If \( t = 0 \), the loop does not execute, and the values of \( x \) and \( y \) remain as they were in the initial state.

**Output State:**
\[
\text{Output State: } t \text{ is a non-negative integer such that } 1 \leq t \leq 100, \text{ } x \text{ is an integer such that } 0 \leq x \leq 9, \text{ } y \text{ is an integer such that } 0 \leq y \leq 9. \text{ If } t > 0, \text{ the loop processes } t \text{ pairs of integers and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair. After all iterations, } x \text{ and } y \text{ will hold the values of the last pair of integers entered by the user. If } t = 0, \text{ the loop does not execute, and the values of } x \text{ and } y \text{ remain as they were in the initial state.}
