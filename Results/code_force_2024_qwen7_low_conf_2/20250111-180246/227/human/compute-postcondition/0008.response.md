The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial conditions are that `t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 9\), and `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq 9\). After running the code, the values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers read from the input, while `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer equal to the first number input, `y` is an integer equal to the second number input**
