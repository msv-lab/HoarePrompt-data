`aseg[r + 1]` is decremented by 1. The value of `r` is an input integer, so the exact value of `aseg[r + 1]` is not known, but it is decreased by 1. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `aseg[r + 1]` is a value that is 1 less than its original value.**
