`n` and `m` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for `n` and `m`, but we can state that they are integers obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input**
