Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is 0, `aseg[0]` is its original value, `aseg[1] is `2 * aseg[0]`, for each `j` from 2 to `n + 1`, `aseg[j]` is the cumulative sum up to `j - 1`, `along[0]` is its original value, for each `k` from 1 to `n - 1`, `along[k]` is the maximum of `along[k]` and `along[k - 1]`, `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value among all elements in `along`, `l` and `r` are any valid integers, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements initialized to 0, and `dp[n - 1]` is either `0` or `max(0, aseg[n - 1] + dp[along[n - 1]])` depending on whether `along[i] < 0` or not.***
