The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to work with inputs that are not directly passed as arguments but rather implied through the context of the problem description. Given the constraints, it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers `n` and `m`, and arrays of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function does not return a single value but rather processes and likely outputs results based on these inputs.

However, following the format and the given example, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `n` and `m`, and arrays of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It does not return a direct value but processes these inputs according to the specified constraints.**
