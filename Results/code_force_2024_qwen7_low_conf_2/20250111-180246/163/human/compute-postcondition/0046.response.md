The code `print(dp[1])` accesses the second element of the `dp` array (`dp[1]`) and prints it. Since the initial state specifies that `dp[0]` contains the maximum value that can be obtained starting from index 0 and moving backwards through the `dp` array, and all other elements of `dp` remain 0, `dp[1]` is specifically stated to be 0.

Therefore, the code will print `0`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `dp[0]` contains the maximum value that can be obtained starting from index 0 and moving backwards through the `dp` array, `dp[1]` is 0, all other elements of `dp` remain 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `m` is 0, `aseg[0]` is its original value, `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`, for each `j` from 2 to `n + 1`, `aseg[j]` is the cumulative sum up to `j - 1`, `along[0]` is its original value, for each `k` from 1 to `n - 1`, `along[k]` is the maximum of `along[k]` and `along[k - 1]`, `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value among all elements in `along`, `l` and `r` are any valid integers.**
