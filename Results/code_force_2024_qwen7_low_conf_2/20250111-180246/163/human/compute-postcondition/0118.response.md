According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` must be less than `n`).

The states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
