The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n - 1` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, after executing the code, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n - 1]`) will be updated to the value of `dp[n]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[n]`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
