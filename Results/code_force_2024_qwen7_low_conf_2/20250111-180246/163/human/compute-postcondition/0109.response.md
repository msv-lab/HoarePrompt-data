`l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of the other variables (`aseg`, `m`, `n`, `along`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0 except for `aseg[l]` which is 2 and `aseg[r + 1]` which is -2, `m` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `l` and `r` are integers input by the user, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`**
