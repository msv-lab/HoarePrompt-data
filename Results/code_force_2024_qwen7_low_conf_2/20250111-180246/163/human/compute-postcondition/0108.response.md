Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0 except for `aseg[l]` which is 2 and `aseg[r + 1]` which is -2.
   - `m` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer from input.
   - `l` and `r` are input integers.
   - `along[l]` is `r + 1`.
   - `i` is `m`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop `for i in range(m):` means the loop will iterate `m` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `m`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration). Therefore, `i` should be `m + 1`.

Since the other variables (`aseg`, `m`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `along[l]`) do not change within the loop based on the given information, they remain the same.

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

- `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0 except for `aseg[l]` which is 2 and `aseg[r + 1]` which is -2.
- `m` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer from input.
- `l` and `r` are input integers.
- `along[l]` is `r + 1`.
- `i` is `m + 1`.

State: **`aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0 except for `aseg[l]` which is 2 and `aseg[r + 1]` which is -2, `m` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `l` and `r` are input integers, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, `i` is `m + 1`**
