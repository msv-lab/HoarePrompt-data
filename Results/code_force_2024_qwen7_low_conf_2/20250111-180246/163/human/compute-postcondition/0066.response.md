Output State: **`i` is equal to `m`, `dp[0]` contains the maximum value that can be obtained starting from index 0, `dp[1]` is 0, all other elements of `dp` remain 0, `t` is incremented by `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input (and must be greater than 0), `aseg[0]` is 0, `aseg[1]` is 0, for each `l` where `aseg[l]` was updated, `aseg[l]` is the maximum of `r + 1` and the original value of `aseg[l]` before any updates, `aseg[r + 1]` is 0 if `r + 1` is outside the bounds of the array, otherwise it is a value that is 1 less than its original value, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements, each set to -1, `l` and `r` are integers input by the user, `along[l]` is the maximum of `r + 1` and the original value of `along[l]` before any updates.**
