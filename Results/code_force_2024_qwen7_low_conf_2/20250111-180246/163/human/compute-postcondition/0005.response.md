The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. This means that `l` and `r` are now assigned the values of the first and second integers input by the user, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is the first integer input, and `r` is the second integer input.**
