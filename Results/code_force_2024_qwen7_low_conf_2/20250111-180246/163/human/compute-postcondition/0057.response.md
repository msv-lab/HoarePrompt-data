The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `l` and `r`. The values of `i` and `m` are not affected by this code. Therefore, `i` remains 2 and `m` must still be greater than 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
