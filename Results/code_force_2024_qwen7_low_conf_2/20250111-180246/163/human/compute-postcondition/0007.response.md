`aseg[r + 1]` is decremented by 1. The value of `aseg[l]` is 1, and all other elements in `aseg` are 0. After decrementing `aseg[r + 1]`, its value will be -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0 except `aseg[l]` which is 1, `aseg[r + 1]` is -1, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is the first integer input, and `r` is the second integer input.**
