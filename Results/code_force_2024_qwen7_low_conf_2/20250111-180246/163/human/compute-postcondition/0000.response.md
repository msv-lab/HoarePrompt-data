To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop will start iterating. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input provided will trigger the loop.

The loop is triggered by the number of test cases, which is read from the input. The variable `_` in the loop is simply used as a placeholder to iterate over the number of test cases provided. Therefore, the loop will execute if there is at least one test case.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), where `t` represents the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, we need `t` to be greater than 0. Since `t` can range from 1 to \(10^4\), we only need to ensure `t` is positive.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0**.

In practice, since `t` is within the given bounds, we only need to confirm that `t` is indeed greater than 0, which it always will be according to the problem constraints.

Thus, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0**.
