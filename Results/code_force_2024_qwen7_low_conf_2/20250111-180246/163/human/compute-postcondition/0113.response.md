Output State: **`aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` where `aseg[l]` for each `l` is the number of times `l` appears as the left boundary in the inputs and `aseg[r + 1]` for each `r` is the negative of the number of times `r + 1` appears as the right boundary plus one in the inputs, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where `along[l]` is the maximum right boundary `r + 1` encountered for each `l` during the loop executions, `m` is an integer from input, `n` is an integer from input, and the loop has executed `m` times.**
