The code snippet `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r` respectively. This means the values of `l` and `r` are now set to the integers entered by the user.

Let's break down the impact on the variables:
- `t` remains unchanged and is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `aseg[l]` remains 2.
- `aseg[r + 1]` remains -2.
- All other elements in `aseg` remain 0.
- `along[l]` remains `r + 1`.
- All other elements in `along` remain -1.
- `m` remains greater than 0.
- `i` remains `i + 1` from the previous iteration.
- `l` is now the first integer input.
- `r` is now the second integer input.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `aseg[l]` is 2.
- `aseg[r + 1]` is -2.
- All other elements in `aseg` are 0.
- `along[l]` is `r + 1`.
- All other elements in `along` are -1.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `l` is the first integer input.
- `r` is the second integer input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `aseg[l]` is 2, `aseg[r + 1]` is -2, all other elements in `aseg` are 0, `along[l]` is `r + 1`, all other elements in `along` are -1, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input**.
