The code reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This affects the variables `l` and `r` by assigning them the values of the two integers input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `aseg`, `along`, `m`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0 except `aseg[l]` which is 1, `aseg[r + 1]` is -1, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with `along[l]` updated to `r + 1` and all other elements equal to -1, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `l` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input**
