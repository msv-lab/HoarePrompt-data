Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers, `dp[1]` contains the maximum value that can be obtained starting from index 1 and moving backwards through the `dp` array based on the operations performed by the loop, all other elements of `dp` are updated according to the loop logic, `aseg[0]` is its original value, for each `j` from 1 to `n + 1`, `aseg[j]` is the cumulative sum up to `j - 1`, `along[0]` is its original value, for each `k` from 1 to `n - 1`, `along[k]` is the maximum of `along[k]` and `along[k - 1]`, `along[n]` is the maximum value among all elements in `along`, `l` and `r` are any valid integers.**
