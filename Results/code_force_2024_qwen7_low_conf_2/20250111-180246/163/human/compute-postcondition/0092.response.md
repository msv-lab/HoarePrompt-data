Output State: **`i` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers, and `n` must be a positive integer. If `along[i]` is less than 0 for all `i` from `n` to `1`, then `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[i + 1]` for all `i` from `n` to `1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i + 1]` and `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]` for all valid `i` from `n` to `1`. All other variables retain their original state.**
