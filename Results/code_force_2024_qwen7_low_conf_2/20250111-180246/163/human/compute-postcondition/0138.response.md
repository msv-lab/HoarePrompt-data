Postcondition: ***`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])` if `along[i] < 0`; otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])`. `n` is greater than 0.***

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block, ensuring that the state of the program variables (`total`, `i`, `dp[i]`, and `n`) is accurately reflected after the execution of the if-else statement, taking into account the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
