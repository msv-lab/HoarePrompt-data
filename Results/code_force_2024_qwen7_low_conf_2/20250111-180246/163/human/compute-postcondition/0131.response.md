According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `n` down to 1. The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `total` is unspecified, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop starts with `i` being `n` and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.
2. The loop will continue until `i` becomes 1 (inclusive).
3. The condition `n` must be greater than 0 ensures that the loop will run at least once if `n` is 1.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by 1, making it `n - 1`.

Given that `n` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

The final answer is:
State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
