The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, this means that `dp[n - 1]` is now equal to `dp[n]`. The values of `total` and `n` remain unspecified, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 1`, `dp[n - 1]` is equal to `dp[n]`**
