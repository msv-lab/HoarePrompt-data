The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `along[i]` is less than 0, the only variable that changes is `dp[i]`.

Since the value of `dp[i + 1]` is not specified, it remains unspecified in the output state. However, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[n]`) is now equal to `dp[n + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `along[i]` is less than 0, `dp[i]` (or `dp[n]`) is equal to `dp[n + 1]`**
