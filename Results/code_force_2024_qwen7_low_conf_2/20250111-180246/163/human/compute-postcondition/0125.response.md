To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement step by step:

The for loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the `range()` function**:
   - The `range(n, 0, -1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` down to `0` (exclusive) in steps of `-1`.
   - This means `i` will take values from `n` down to `1` (since `0` is excluded).

2. **Determining the conditions for loop execution**:
   - For the loop to start and execute at least once, there must be some valid value for `i` within the specified range.
   - Specifically, `i` must start from a value where `n > 0`, because if `n` is less than or equal to `0`, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Initial state adjustments**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and decreases until `1`, `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Additionally, `i` will start at `n`, so we need to set `i` to `n`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to start and execute.
- `i` must be set to `n` for the first iteration.

Thus, the required states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
