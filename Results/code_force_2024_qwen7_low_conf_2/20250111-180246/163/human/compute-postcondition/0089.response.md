The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` assigns the value of `dp[i + 1]` to `dp[i]`. This means that the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`dp[i]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1]`, and all other variables retain their initial state.**
