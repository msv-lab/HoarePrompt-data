`aseg[l]` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is an integer input by the user. All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `dp[0]` contains the maximum value that can be obtained starting from index 0, `dp[1]` is 0, all other elements of `dp` remain 0, `t` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input (and must be greater than 1), `aseg[0]` is 0, `aseg[1]` is 0, `aseg[l]` is 1 (where `l` is an integer input by the user), `aseg[2]` to `aseg[n + 1]` are 0, `along` is a list of `n + 2` elements, each set to -1, `l` and `r` are integers input by the user.**
