`n` and `m` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which reads two integers separated by space from the standard input and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer**
