Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 3`, `dp[i]` is either `dp[i + 1]` or `aseg[i] + dp[along[i]]` (whichever is greater), `aseg[0]` is its original value, `aseg[1]` is `2 * aseg[0]`, for each `j` from 2 to `n + 1`, `aseg[j]` is the cumulative sum up to `j - 1`, `along[0]` is its original value, for each `k` from 1 to `n - 1`, `along[k]` is the maximum of `along[k]` and `along[k - 1]`, `along[n - 1]` is the maximum value among all elements in `along`, `l` and `r` are any valid integers, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` where `dp[i]` is updated and all other elements remain 0.***
