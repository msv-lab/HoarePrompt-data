Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` where `aseg[l]` is the sum of all increments at index `l` and `aseg[r + 1]` is the negative sum of all decrements at index `r + 1`, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` where `along[l]` is the maximum of all `r + 1` values encountered for each `l`, `m` is the total number of iterations of the loop, `l` is the last integer input for the left boundary, and `r` is the last integer input for the right boundary.**
