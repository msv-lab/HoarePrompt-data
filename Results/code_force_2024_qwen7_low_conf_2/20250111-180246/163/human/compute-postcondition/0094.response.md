Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers.
   - `dp[1]` retains its original value.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop runs for as many times as the user inputs (i.e., the number of lines the user enters).
   - There is no explicit modification of `i` or `dp` within the loop body; it only depends on the input.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since there is no explicit modification of `i` or `dp` within the loop, the values of `i` and `dp` remain unchanged from the initial state.
   - The only thing that changes is the number of iterations the loop will perform based on user input.

5. **For the Loop to Execute One More Time:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user needs to provide an additional line of input.
   - Therefore, the number of iterations will increase by 1.

6. **New State:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `dp` remains a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers, and `dp[1]` retains its original value.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - The loop will now run one more time based on the additional user input.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `dp` is a list of length `n + 2` where all elements are integers, and `dp[1]` retains its original value, `n` must be a positive integer, and the loop will execute one more time based on user input.**
