According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 3. The condition for the loop to continue is still that `m` must be greater than 2.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2**
