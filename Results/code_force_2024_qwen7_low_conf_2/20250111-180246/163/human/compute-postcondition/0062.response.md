The code `l, r = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `l` and `r`. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. However, we know that `l` and `r` will be integers.

The initial state of `i` is 3, and `m` must be greater than 2. These conditions remain unchanged unless the input affects `m`, but since `m` is not mentioned in the code, its state remains valid as per the initial condition.

Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
