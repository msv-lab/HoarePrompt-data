The code `aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]` updates the value of `aseg[i + 1]` by adding the value of `aseg[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, the index `i + 1` is 2. Therefore, the value of `aseg[2]` is updated to its current value plus the value of `aseg[1]`. 

Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `aseg[1]` and `aseg[2]`, we denote the updated value of `aseg[2]` as `aseg[2] + aseg[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `aseg[2]` is `aseg[1] + aseg[2]`**
