In the current iteration, `i` is `n - 1`, and the code snippet updates `dp[i]` as follows:
```python
dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
```
This line sets `dp[i]` to the value of `dp[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the value of `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[n]`.

The values of `total`, `i`, and `dp[i]` are updated, but `n` remains unchanged. The state at the start of the next iteration (when `i` becomes `n - 2`) will be:
- `total` remains unspecified.
- `i` decreases by 1, so `i` is now `n - 2`.
- `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`, which means `dp[n - 2]` is set to `dp[n - 1]`.

Thus, the output state after executing the given code snippet is:

Output State: **`total` is unspecified, `i` is `n - 2`, `dp[i]` is `dp[n - 1]`, `n` is greater than 0**.
