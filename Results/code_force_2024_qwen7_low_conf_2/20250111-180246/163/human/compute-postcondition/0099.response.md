`l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers. The input is expected to provide two integers separated by a space, which will be assigned to `l` and `r`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input and must be greater than 0, `aseg` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to 0, `along` is a list of length `n + 2` with all elements equal to -1, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**
