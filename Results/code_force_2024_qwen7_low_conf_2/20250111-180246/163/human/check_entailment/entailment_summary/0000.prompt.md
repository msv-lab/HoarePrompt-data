You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
There is a fun game where you need to feed cats that come and go. The level of
the game consists of n steps. There are m cats; the cat i is present in steps
from l_i to r_i , inclusive. In each step, you can feed all the cats that are
currently present or do nothing.

If you feed the same cat more than once, it will overeat, and you will
immediately lose the game. Your goal is to feed as many cats as possible
without causing any cat to overeat.

Find the maximum number of cats you can feed.

Formally, you need to select several integer points from the segment from 1 to
n in such a way that among given segments, none covers two or more of the
selected points, and as many segments as possible cover one of the selected
points.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le
10^6 , 1 \le m\le 2\cdot 10^5 ).

The i -th of the next m lines contains a pair of integers l_i and r_i (1 \le
l_i \le r_i \le n ).

The sum of n for all tests does not exceed 10^6 , the sum of m for all tests
does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the maximum number of cats you can
feed.

Note

In the first example, one of the ways to feed five cats is to feed at steps 4
and 11 .

  * At step 4 , cats 1 , 2 , and 3 will be fed.
  * At step 11 , cats 5 and 6 will be fed.

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        aseg = [0] * (n + 2)
        along = [-1] * (n + 2)
        for i in range(m):
            (l, r) = map(int, input().split())
            aseg[l] += 1
            aseg[r + 1] -= 1
            along[l] = max(r + 1, along[l])
        dp = [0] * (n + 2)
        for i in range(n):
            aseg[i + 1] += aseg[i]
            along[i] = max(along[i], along[i - 1])
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            if along[i] < 0:
                dp[i] = dp[i + 1]
            else:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i + 1], aseg[i] + dp[along[i]])
        print(dp[1])





# Execution Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers `n` and `m`, and arrays of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each test case, it constructs a dynamic programming (DP) solution to find the maximum value that can be obtained starting from index 1 and moving backwards through the DP array based on the specified operations. Specifically, for each interval `[l_i, r_i]`, it updates two auxiliary arrays: `aseg` (which keeps track of prefix sums) and `along` (which stores the maximum possible end index for each start index). After processing all intervals, it calculates the DP values such that `dp[i]` represents the maximum value obtainable starting from index `i`. The function ultimately prints the result of `dp[1]` for each test case. Potential edge cases include when `l_i` equals `r_i` (in which case no update is made to `aseg`), and when there are no valid intervals (in which case `dp[1]` would be zero).
