You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on t and n . You can make hacks only if both
versions of the problem are solved.

For a binary^\dagger pattern p and a binary string q , both of length m , q is
called p -good if for every i (1 \leq i \leq m ), there exist indices l and r
such that:

  * 1 \leq l \leq i \leq r \leq m , and 
  * p_i is a mode^\ddagger of the string q_l q_{l+1} \ldots q_{r} . 

For a pattern p , let f(p) be the minimum possible number of \mathtt{1} s in a
p -good binary string (of the same length as the pattern).

You are given a binary string s of size n . Find

In other words, you need to sum the values of f over all \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
substrings of s .

^\dagger A binary pattern is a string that only consists of characters
\mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

^\ddagger Character c is a mode of string t of length m if the number of
occurrences of c in t is at least \lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil . For example,
\mathtt{0} is a mode of \mathtt{010} , \mathtt{1} is not a mode of
\mathtt{010} , and both \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} are modes of \mathtt{011010}
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the binary string s .

The second line of each test case contains a binary string s of length n
consisting of only characters \mathtt{0} and \mathtt{1} .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4
.

Output

For each test case, output the sum of values of f over all substrings of s .

Output

    1
    2
    0
    346
    
Note

In the first test case, the only \mathtt{1} -good string is \mathtt{1} . Thus,
f(\mathtt{1})=1 .

In the second test case, f(\mathtt{10})=1 because \mathtt{01} is \mathtt{10}
-good, and \mathtt{00} is not \mathtt{10} -good. Thus, the answer is
f(\mathtt{1})+f(\mathtt{10})+f(\mathtt{0}) = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 .

In the third test case, f equals to 0 for all 1 \leq i \leq j \leq 5 . Thus,
the answer is 0 .
