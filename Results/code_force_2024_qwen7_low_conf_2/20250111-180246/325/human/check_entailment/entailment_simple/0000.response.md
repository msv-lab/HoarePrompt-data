Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not compute the function \( f(p) \) for all substrings of the binary string \( s \) and sum these values as required.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Computation of \( f(p) \)**:
   - The program calculates \( f(p) \) for the entire string \( s \) instead of for all its substrings. According to the problem, \( f(p) \) should be computed for all possible substrings of \( s \).
   - The program uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to calculate the minimum number of 1s needed for the substring ending at position \( i \) of \( s \). However, this is only done for the full string and not for all substrings.

2. **Summing Over All Substrings**:
   - The problem requires summing \( f(p) \) over all \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) substrings of \( s \). The program does not account for all substrings; it only computes the value for the full string.

3. **DP Initialization and Update**:
   - The dynamic programming approach used in the program is initialized and updated for the full string but does not extend to subproblems for all substrings.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
1. Iterate over all possible substrings of \( s \).
2. For each substring, compute \( f(p) \).
3. Sum the values of \( f(p) \) for all substrings.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how the program should be structured:

1. **Outer Loop**: Iterate over all starting points of substrings.
2. **Inner Loop**: Iterate over all ending points of substrings.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Compute \( f(p) \) for the substring using dynamic programming.
4. **Accumulate Results**: Sum the results of \( f(p) \) for all substrings.

The current implementation fails to meet these requirements and thus does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
