Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of values of \( f \) over all substrings of the binary string \( s \), but it does not accurately determine the minimum number of 1s in a \( p \)-good binary string for each substring pattern \( p \). 

The core issue lies in the logic used to calculate \( dp[i] \). The program incorrectly assumes that the value of \( dp[i] \) is simply \( n - i + dp[i + 1] \) when \( s[i] == '1' \), without properly accounting for the requirement that the substring must be \( p \)-good. 

A correct implementation would need to evaluate each substring to ensure it meets the \( p \)-good condition and then calculate the minimum number of 1s required. The current approach does not handle this evaluation correctly, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
