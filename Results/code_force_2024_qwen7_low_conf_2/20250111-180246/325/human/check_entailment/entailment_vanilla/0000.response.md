Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into chunks. It correctly identifies the number of test cases, the length of each string, and the strings themselves.

2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: A dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized to store the minimum possible number of `1`s for each substring ending at each position. This setup is correct.

3. **DP Calculation**: The DP calculation is performed correctly from the end of the string towards the beginning. For each position `i`, if `s[i]` is `1`, it calculates the value of `dp[i]` as `n - i + dp[i + 1]`. If `s[i]` is `0`, it sets `dp[i]` to `dp[i + 1]`. This logic ensures that `dp[i]` stores the minimum possible number of `1`s in any `p-good` substring ending at `i`.

4. **Result Calculation**: The result for each test case is calculated as the sum of the first `n` elements of the `dp` array, which correctly represents the sum of `f(p)` over all substrings of `s`.

5. **Output**: The results are printed out one by one, which is correct.

Given the logic and implementation align with the problem statement and examples provided, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
