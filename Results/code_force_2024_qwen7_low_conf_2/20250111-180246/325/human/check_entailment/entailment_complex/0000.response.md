### Reasoning:

Let's break down the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Function Call and Initial State**:
   - The program starts by calling `func_1()`.
   - Before entering `func_1()`, the state of the program is as described:
     - `t` is the number of test cases, \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
     - For each test case, `n` is the length of the binary string `s`, \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
     - `s` is a binary string of length `n`.

2. **Inside `func_1()`**:
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the number of test cases (`num_cases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` and `s` from the input.
   - It initializes a `dp` array to store intermediate results.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum number of `1`s required for all substrings starting from each position `i` to the end of the string.
   - It calculates the sum of `dp[:n]` for each test case and appends it to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles the calculation of the minimum number of `1`s needed for all substrings ending at each position `i`.
   - The transition `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]` if `s[i] == '1'` ensures that the current character contributes to the count if it is `1`.
   - The transition `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` if `s[i] == '0'` ensures that the current character does not contribute to the count if it is `0`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `s` is empty or `n` is zero. When `s` is empty, the program still processes the case and calculates the result accordingly.
   - The sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed \(10^4\), which means the program should be efficient enough to handle the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
