#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a binary string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    num_cases = int(data[index])
    index += 1

                dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[index]` after the loop completes, `s` is the value of `data[index + 1]` after the loop completes, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is `2 * num_cases`, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` after the loop completes, `results` is a list containing the sum of `dp[:n]` for each iteration, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is determined based on the value of `s`, and `result` is the sum of `dp[:n]` for the last iteration.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `results` is a non-empty list that must have exactly `num_cases` elements, and `result` is the sum of `dp[:n]` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases defined by the number of test cases `t`, the integer `n`, and the binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the binary string `s` using dynamic programming. The function stores these sums in a list `results` and prints each sum after completing all test cases. The final state of the program includes `results` as a non-empty list containing the calculated sums for all test cases, and `result` holding the sum of `dp[:n]` for the last iteration. Potential edge cases include handling invalid input and ensuring that `n` and the length of `s` match. If `s` is empty or `n` is zero, the function still processes the case and calculates the result accordingly.
