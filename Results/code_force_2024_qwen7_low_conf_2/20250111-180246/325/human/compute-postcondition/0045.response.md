`dp[i]` is assigned the value of `dp[i + 1]`. According to the initial state, `i` is \( n - 2 \). Therefore, `dp[i]` becomes `dp[n - 1]`.

The output state will reflect this change while keeping all other variables as they were:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 500 \), `n` is at least 1, `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]`, `s` is now `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 5, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string, `dp[j]` is updated to \( n - j + dp[j + 1] \) where \( s[j] == '1' \), if no character '1' is found in `s`, `dp` remains unchanged, `i` is \( n - 2 \), `dp[i]` is `dp[n - 1]`.**
