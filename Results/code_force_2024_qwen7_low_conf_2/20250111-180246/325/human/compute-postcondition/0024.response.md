Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes the following variables:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1
   - `s` is now `data[2]`
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element
   - `index` is 3
   - `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
   - `result` is 0
   - `i` is `n - 3`

2. The code snippet to execute is:
   ```python
   dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]
   ```

3. Let's identify the variables affected by this code:
   - `dp[i]` is updated to the value of `n - i + dp[i + 1]`.
   - `i` is already defined as `n - 3`.

4. The updated value of `dp[i]` depends on the current value of `i` which is `n - 3`. So, `dp[n - 3]` is updated to `n - (n - 3) + dp[n - 2]`.

Given the initial conditions, we can update `dp[n - 3]`:
- Since `dp` is initialized to a list of `n + 1` zeros, `dp[n - 2]` is 0 initially.
- Therefore, `dp[n - 3] = n - (n - 3) + 0 = 3`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[n - 3]` set to 3, `result` is 0, `i` is `n - 3`**.
