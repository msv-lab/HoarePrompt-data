The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1]`. Given that `dp` is initially a list of `n + 1` zeros, the value of `dp[i + 1]` is 0. Therefore, `dp[i]` is updated to 0.

Since the initial state of `dp` is `[0] * (n + 1)` (a list of `n + 1` zeros), updating `dp[i]` to 0 changes the list `dp` to have its `i-th` element set to 0 while the rest remain 0. All other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where the `i-th` element is 0 and the rest are 0, `result` is 0, `s[i]` is not equal to '1'**
