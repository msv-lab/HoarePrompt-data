The code initializes a list `dp` with zeros, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. This means `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. The values of the other variables (`t`, `s`, `data`, `index`, `num_cases`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
