The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state where `index` is 1, after executing this code, `index` will become 2. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 2, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list**
