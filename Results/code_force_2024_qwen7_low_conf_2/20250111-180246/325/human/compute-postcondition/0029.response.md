The code `results.append(result)` appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. This means that `result` is added to the end of the list `results`. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, `index`, `num_cases`, `dp`, and `result` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string, `result` is the sum of the elements in `dp` up to the index `n-1`.**
