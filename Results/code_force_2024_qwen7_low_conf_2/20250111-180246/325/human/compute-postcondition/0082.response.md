The code `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res`. However, the variable `res` is not defined in the provided initial state, and there is no assignment or calculation involving `res` before the print statement. Therefore, the print statement will raise an error because `res` is not defined. Since the initial state does not include `res`, and no changes are made to any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list**
