Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is at least 1, `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]`, `s` is now `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 5, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string, and `dp[j]` is updated to `n - j + dp[j + 1]` where `s[j] == '1'`. If no character '1' is found in `s`, `dp` remains unchanged.***
