Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is equal to `data[6]` and must be at least 1, `s` is the eighth element of `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 8, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`, and `i` is -1. If `s[-1]` is '1', then `dp[-1]` is assigned the value `n + 1 + dp[0]`. If `s[-1]` is not '1', then there is an error indicating an out-of-range access for `dp[-1]`.***
