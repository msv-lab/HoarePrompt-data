`index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after the increment, `index` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, and `num_cases`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`.**
