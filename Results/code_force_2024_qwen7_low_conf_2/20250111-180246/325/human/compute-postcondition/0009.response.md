`s` is reassigned to the value of `data[index]`. Given the initial state, `index` is 2, so `s` will take the value of `data[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 2, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list**
