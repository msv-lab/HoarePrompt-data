The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. This means that the value of `result` is added to the end of the list `results`.

Since `result` is the sum of `dp[:n]`, the updated state of `results` is `[result]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is equal to `data[6]` and must be at least 1, `s` is the eighth element of `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 8, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing `[result]`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is determined based on the value of `s`, and `result` is the sum of `dp[:n]`.**
