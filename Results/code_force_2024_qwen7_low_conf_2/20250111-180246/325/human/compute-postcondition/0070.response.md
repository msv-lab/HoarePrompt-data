Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is equal to `data[6]` and must be at least 1, `s` is the eighth element of `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 8, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`. If `s[i] == '1'` for any `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, then `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with elements updated as `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` and `i` ends up being 0. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element from index 0 to `n-2` is 0 and `dp[n-1]` is 0, and `i` is 0.***
