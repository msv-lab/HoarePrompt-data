The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the value of `dp[n - 2]` is now set to be the same as `dp[n - 1]`.

The other variables remain unchanged in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1; `s` is now `data[2]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element; `index` is 3; `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`; `results` is an empty list; `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `dp[n - 2]` updated to `dp[n - 1]`; `result` is 0; `i` is `n - 2`.**
