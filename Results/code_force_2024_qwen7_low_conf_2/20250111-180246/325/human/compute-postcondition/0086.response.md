The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters but is described in terms of constraints related to variables `t`, `n`, and `s`. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, we focus on the outputs based on the given constraints.

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
- The sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed \(10^4\).

Based on these constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each defined by `t`, `n`, and `s`. 

Output:
Case_1: The function returns a result based on processing the binary string `s` of length `n` for each test case.
Case_2: Since there are multiple test cases, the function may return a list or dictionary containing results for each test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process multiple test cases, each defined by `t`, `n`, and `s`, and return results based on the binary string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases defined by `t`, `n`, and `s`, and returns results based on the binary string `s`.**
