The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. Given the initial state, the variable `index` is 3, so `n` will be assigned the integer value of `data[3]`.

Let's summarize the changes and the unchanged states:

- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[3]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `s`, `data`, `index`, `num_cases`, `results`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]` and must be at least 1, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string.**
