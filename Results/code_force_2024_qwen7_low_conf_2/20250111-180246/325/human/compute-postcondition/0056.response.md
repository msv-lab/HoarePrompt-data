`index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 6, so after incrementing, `index` becomes 7. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is equal to `data[6]`; `s` is the fourth element of `data`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element; `index` is 7; `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, and `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string, and for each index \(i\) from 0 to \(n\), `dp[i]` is calculated as follows: if `s[i] == '1'`, then `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]`; otherwise, `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]`; `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.**
