The code prints the value of the variable `res`. However, the variable `res` is not updated or assigned any new value in the given code snippet. Therefore, the print statement will simply output the current value of `res`. Since `results` is a non-empty list, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list**
