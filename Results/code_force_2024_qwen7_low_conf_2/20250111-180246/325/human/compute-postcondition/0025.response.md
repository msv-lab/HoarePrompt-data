The code `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is set to `n - 3`, so `dp[i]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i + 1]`, which is `dp[n - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 3, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list, `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `result` is 0, `i` is `n - 4`, `dp[i]` is equal to `dp[n - 2]`**.
