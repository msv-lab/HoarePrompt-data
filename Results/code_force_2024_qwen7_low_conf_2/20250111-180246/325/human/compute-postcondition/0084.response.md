The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res`. However, in the initial state, `results` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, but there is no assignment or manipulation of `res` before the print statement. Therefore, `res` is not defined or updated within the given code snippet.

Since `res` is not defined, the code will raise a NameError when executed. No changes are made to the initial state of `results`.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list that must have at least 2 elements, and there is a NameError due to the undefined variable `res`.**
