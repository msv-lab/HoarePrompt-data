The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`. This does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `s`. It just changes how input is read from standard input. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `s` is a binary string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1', and `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**
