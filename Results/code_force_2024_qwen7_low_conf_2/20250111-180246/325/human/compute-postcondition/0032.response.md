The variable `index` is incremented by 1. Initially, `index` is 3, so after executing `index += 1`, `index` becomes 4. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, `num_cases`, `results`, and `dp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]`, `s` is now `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 4, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string.**
