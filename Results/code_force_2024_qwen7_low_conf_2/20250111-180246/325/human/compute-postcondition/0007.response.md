The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value at the position specified by `index` in the list `data` and converts it to an integer using `int()`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element
- `index` is 1
- `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`
- `results` is an empty list

The variable `n` is updated to the integer value at `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list**
