Let's analyze the loop and determine the final state of the variables after the loop executes.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates from `length - 1` down to `0`. The key operations within the loop are:
- If `input_string[i]` is `'1'`, then `dp[i]` is set to `length - i + dp[i + 3]`.
- If `input_string[i]` is `'0'`, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[i + 1]`.

### Final State After All Iterations
1. **Initialization**:
   - `num_cases` > 0 (unchanged).
   - `length` ≥ 0 (unchanged).
   - `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements initialized to 0.
   - `result` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `input_string` is the stripped input string (unchanged).

2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - The loop updates `dp[i]` based on the value of `input_string[i]` and the values of `dp[i+1]` and `dp[i+3]`.
   - For each `i` from `length - 1` to `0`, `dp[i]` is updated according to the condition in the loop.
   - By the end of the loop, `dp[0]` will contain the final computed value.

3. **Final Values**:
   - `dp[0]` will be the result of the computation performed by the loop, starting from the last character of `input_string` and moving backwards.
   - `i` will be `-1` after the loop ends (since the loop increments `i` towards `-1`).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `num_cases`, `length`, `result`, and `input_string` remain unchanged.

### Conclusion
After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of the variables will be:
- `num_cases` > 0.
- `length` ≥ 0.
- `i` = -1.
- `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements where each element is 0, except `dp[0]` which contains the final computed value.
- `result` is 0.
- `input_string` is the stripped input string.

### Output State
Output State: **`num_cases` is a positive integer, `length` is a non-negative integer, `i` is -1, `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements where each element is 0 except `dp[0]` which is the result of the computation, `result` is 0, and `input_string` is the stripped input string.**
