The code snippet `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]` modifies the `dp` list. Given the initial state:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` is at least 1, `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]`
- `s` is now `data[4]`
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element
- `index` is 5
- `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0
- `results` is a list containing the value of `result`
- `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0
- `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string
- `result` is 0
- `s[i]` is not '1'

The code sets `dp[i]` to `dp[i + 1]`. Since the index `i` is not specified, this operation applies to every index in the range of `dp`, effectively setting each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`) to the next element `dp[i + 1]`.

Given that `dp` is initialized to 0 for all elements, `dp[i + 1]` is also 0 for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. For `i = n`, `dp[n]` does not exist, so the assignment does not affect the last element.

Therefore, the updated `dp` list will be `[0, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (a list of zeros of length `n + 1`).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is at least 1, `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]`, `s` is now `data[4]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 5, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `result`, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, `result` is 0**
