Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is an integer equal to `data[1]` and must be at least 1; `s` is now `data[2]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element; `index` is 3; `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`; `results` is an empty list; `dp` is a list of `n + 1` zeros; `result` is 0. If `s[i]` is '1', the `i-th` element of `dp` is now `n - i`. Otherwise, the `i-th` element of `dp` remains 0.***
