The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly listed in the provided code snippet. However, based on the constraints and relationships described, it implies that the function should handle a series of test cases where each test case includes three inputs: `t`, `n`, and `s`.

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of only characters '0' and '1'.
- The sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed 10,000.

Given the output cases are not specified in the problem statement, we focus on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s`.**
