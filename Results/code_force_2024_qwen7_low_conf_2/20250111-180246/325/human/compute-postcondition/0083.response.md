According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list. Since the list was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, it means there is at least one element left to process in the current iteration.

However, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least two elements in the list. This is because the current iteration is processing the first element, and for the next iteration, the next element must be available.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` contains at least two elements, and the loop will process the second element in the next iteration.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list that must have at least 2 elements**
