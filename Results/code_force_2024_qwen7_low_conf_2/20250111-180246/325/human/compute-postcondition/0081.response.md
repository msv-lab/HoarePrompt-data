According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the list `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.

Let's break it down:

1. **Initial State**: `results` is a non-empty list.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `results`.
3. **End of Previous Iteration**: Since `results` was non-empty, the loop has completed at least one iteration.
4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` still contains at least one element.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list**
