The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 4, so after the increment, `index` becomes 5. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is an integer equal to `data[3]`; `s` is now `data[4]`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element; `index` is 5; `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing the value of `result`; `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string.**
