The code `result = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `result`. This is the only assignment made, so no other variables are affected. The precondition remains valid for the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is equal to `data[6]`; `s` is the eighth element of `data`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element; `index` is 8; `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0; `result` is 0.**
