Output State: **`result` is the sum of all elements in `dp`, `i` is `length + 10`, `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, each initialized to 0 except `dp[0]` which is the result of the computation, `input_string` is the stripped input string.**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `num_cases` is a positive integer.
   - `length` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is initialized to -1.
   - `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, all initialized to 0 except `dp[0]`, which is the result of the computation.
   - `result` is initialized to 0.
   - `input_string` is the stripped input string.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `i` in the `dp` list.
   - Inside the loop, `result` is incremented by the value of `i`.

3. **Observations from Output States**:
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `i` is 0, `result` is 0.
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `i` is 1, `result` is 1.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, `i` is 2, `result` is 3.

4. **Final State Analysis**:
   - Since `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, and the loop iterates over each element, the loop will execute exactly `length + 10` times.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `length + 10`.
   - During each iteration, `result` accumulates the sum of all elements in `dp`.
   - Therefore, `result` will be the sum of all elements in `dp`.

5. **Final Values**:
   - `i` will be `length + 10` (the last element accessed in the list).
   - `dp` remains unchanged as the loop only increments `result`.
   - `result` will be the sum of all elements in `dp`.
   - `input_string` remains the same as it was initialized.

Thus, the final output state is that `result` is the sum of all elements in `dp`, `i` is `length + 10`, `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, each initialized to 0 except `dp[0]` which is the result of the computation, and `input_string` is the stripped input string.
