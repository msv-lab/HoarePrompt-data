Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data[index]` after the loop completes, `s` is the value of `data[index + 1]` after the loop completes, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is `2 * num_cases`, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` after the loop completes, `results` is a list containing the sum of `dp[:n]` for each iteration, `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is determined based on the value of `s`, and `result` is the sum of `dp[:n]` for the last iteration.**
