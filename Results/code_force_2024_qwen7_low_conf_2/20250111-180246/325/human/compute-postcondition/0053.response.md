`results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `dp`. Since `results` was initially a list containing a single element (the value of `result`), appending `result` to `results` means `results` now contains two elements, both of which are the same (the value of `result`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\); `n` is equal to `data[3]`; `s` is the fourth element of `data`; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element; `index` is 5; `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data` minus 1 and must be greater than 0; `results` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the value of `result`; `dp` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements set to 0, and `dp[0]` is the sum of the positions of all '1's in `s` relative to the end of the string, and for each index \(i\) from 0 to \(n\), `dp[i]` is calculated as follows: if \(s[i] == '1'\), then `dp[i] = n - i + dp[i + 1]`; otherwise, `dp[i] = dp[i + 1]`; `result` is the sum of the first `n` elements of `dp`.**
