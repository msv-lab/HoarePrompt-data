`result` is incremented by the value of `i`, which is 2. Therefore, `result` becomes `1 + 2`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, `result` is 3, `input_string` is the stripped input string**
