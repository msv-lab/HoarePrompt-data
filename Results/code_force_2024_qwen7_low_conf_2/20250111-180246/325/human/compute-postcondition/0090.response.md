`result` is incremented by the value of `i`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `result` becomes 0 + 0 = 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, `result` is 0, `input_string` is the stripped input string.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `dp` is a list of `length + 10` elements, `result` is 0, `input_string` is the stripped input string**
