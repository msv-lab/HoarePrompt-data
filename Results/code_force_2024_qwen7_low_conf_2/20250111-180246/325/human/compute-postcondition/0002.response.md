The code `index = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `index`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a binary string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0.**
