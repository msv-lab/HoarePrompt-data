Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop runs `num_cases` times.
   - `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`.
   - The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and is incremented with each iteration.

2. **Initial States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin`.
   - `index` is 1.
   - `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_cases` must be a positive integer.
   - `num_cases` must be less than or equal to the length of `data`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, we need to ensure that `data` is not empty and contains at least one element.
   - Therefore, `data` must have at least one element.

### Conclusion:
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `data` must have at least one element.
- `num_cases` must be a positive integer (which is inherently true if `data` has at least one element).

Thus, the final answer is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting a line read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least one element, `index` is 1, `num_cases` is the first element of the list `data`, `results` is an empty list**.
