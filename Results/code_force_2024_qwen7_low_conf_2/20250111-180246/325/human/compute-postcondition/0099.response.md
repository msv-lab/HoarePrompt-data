Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it uses dynamic programming to compute a value for each position in the string based on the characters '0' and '1'. It then sums these computed values and prints the total sum as a Decimal. The function handles multiple test cases sequentially, ensuring that the `dp` array is reset for each new test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has processed all test cases, printed the total sum for each, and is ready to exit. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the binary string contains invalid characters other than '0' and '1', although the code currently only processes strings of '0' and '1'. There is no explicit handling for invalid input formats (e.g., non-integer values for `n`), which could lead to runtime errors.**
