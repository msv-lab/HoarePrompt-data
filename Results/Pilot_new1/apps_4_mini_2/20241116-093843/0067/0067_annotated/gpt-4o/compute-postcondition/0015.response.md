Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. It then compares these ranges and prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met, indicating an overlap in the possible vote counts. The function does not return any value. **
