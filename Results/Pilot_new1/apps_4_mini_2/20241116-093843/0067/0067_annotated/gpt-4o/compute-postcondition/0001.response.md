`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, where `x` is an input integer. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, and `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, and `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`**
