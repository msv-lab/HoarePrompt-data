Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (`y`), the output is '-'. If `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` (`y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (`x`), the output is '+'. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`, the output is '?'. This ensures all edge cases are considered, including the scenarios where `max_upvotes` equals `min_downvotes` or `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes`.***
