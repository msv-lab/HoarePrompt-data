The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the integers `x`, `y`, and `z` within the defined constraints, but the specific return value or behavior of the function is not detailed. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with integers x, y, and z constrained between 0 and 100, but the specific return value is not defined.**
