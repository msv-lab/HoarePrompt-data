`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, which is an input integer. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (input integer), `y` (input integer), `z` (input integer), `min_upvotes` (assigned the value of `x`), and `max_upvotes` (assigned the value of `x + z`). The state of `min_downvotes` is now determined by the value of `y`. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`**
