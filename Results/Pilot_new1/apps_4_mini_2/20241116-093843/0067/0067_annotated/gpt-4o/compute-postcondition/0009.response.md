The code executes a print statement, which outputs the character '+'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged after this execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, the value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, and the output is '+'**
