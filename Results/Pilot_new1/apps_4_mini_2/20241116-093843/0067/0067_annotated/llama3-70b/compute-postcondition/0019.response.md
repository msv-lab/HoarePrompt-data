Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` but `z` is not 0, and '?' if `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`. The function does not return any value. **
