The code `print('-')` outputs a hyphen to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is less than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (x <= y + z), and a hyphen is printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is less than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (x <= y + z), and a hyphen is printed.**
