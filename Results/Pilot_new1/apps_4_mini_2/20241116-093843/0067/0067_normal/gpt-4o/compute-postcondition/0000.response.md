The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on the input provided and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, but they will be updated to whatever integers are input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` have been updated to new integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to new integer values based on input, where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
