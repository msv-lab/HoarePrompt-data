The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `y` holds a new integer value based on input. The other variables (`x`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, and `max_upvotes`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`.

Output State: **`min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**
