To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the conditions under which the program outputs different results and see if it covers all possible scenarios as described.

The problem states that we have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). The output should be determined based on the relationship between these integers.

Let's break down the logic in the code:

1. **If `x > y + z`**: The program outputs `'+'`. This means that even if all unknown votes (z) are downvotes, upvotes (x) would still exceed downvotes.
2. **If `x < y`**: The program outputs `'-'`. This indicates that upvotes are fewer than downvotes, regardless of unknown votes.
3. **If `x == y`**:
   - If `z == 0`, it outputs `'0'`, meaning there are equal upvotes and downvotes with no uncertainty.
   - If `z > 0`, it outputs `'?'`, indicating uncertainty because unknown votes could tip the balance either way.
4. **If `x > y`**: The program outputs `'?'`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the potential impact of the unknown votes.

Now, let's analyze the output hints provided:

- The hints state that if `x` is greater than `y + z`, it prints `'+'`, which is correct.
- If `x` is less than `y`, it prints `'-'`, which is also correct.
- If `x` equals `y` and `z` is `0`, it prints `'0'`, which is correct.
- If `x` equals `y` and `z` is not `0`, it prints `'?'`, which is correct.
- However, the hint states that if `x` is greater than `y`, it also prints `'?'`, which is not accurate since there could be a case where `x > y` but still less than or equal to `y + z`. 

### Edge Cases
- If `x = 3`, `y = 2`, and `z = 1`, the output should be `'+'` because `3 > 2`, but the program would output `'?'`, which is incorrect.
- If `x = 2`, `y = 2`, and `z = 1`, the output should be `'?'` (since the unknown vote can change the result), and the program correctly outputs `'?'`.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case correctly when `x > y` but `x <= y + z`. This means there are scenarios where the output does not match the expected result according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for cases where `x` is greater than `y` but not greater than `y + z`, leading to incorrect output in those situations.
