Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, '?' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `y`, '?' is printed. Additionally, the value of `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x â‰¤ y + z`).***
