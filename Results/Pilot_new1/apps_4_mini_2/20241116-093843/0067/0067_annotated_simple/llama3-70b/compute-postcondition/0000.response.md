The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on the input provided, where the input consists of three integers separated by spaces. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, so we cannot determine their specific values after execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values**
