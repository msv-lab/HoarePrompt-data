The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values are: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, and `max_upvotes` is `x + z`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`**
