The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a non-negative integer `n`, which is constrained to the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since there are no parameters explicitly defined in the function signature, we cannot outline any specific input conditions or relationships. Consequently, we cannot determine the output based on input parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified based on the provided constraints.**
