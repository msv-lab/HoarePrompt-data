The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on a non-negative integer `n` which is constrained to be within the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. Since the specifics of the output based on the value of `n` are not provided, we can only state that the function will return a value based on the value of `n` within the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on the non-negative integer n, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
