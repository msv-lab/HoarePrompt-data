Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; if the last digit of `n` (i.e., `remainder`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is `n` minus `remainder`. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, then `result` is `n` plus the difference between 10 and `remainder`, which can result in values ranging from `n + 1` to `n + 4`.***
