The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, so `remainder` will be the last digit of `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n**
