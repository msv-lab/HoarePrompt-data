Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; if `remainder`, the last digit of `n`, is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`, which results in `result` being either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`, depending on the specific value of `remainder`.***
