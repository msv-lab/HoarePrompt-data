To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

From the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
- We derive `remainder` as the last digit of `n` using `n % 10`.

The logic for `result` is as follows:
- If `remainder` (which is `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`.
- If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Since the code snippet is only `print(result)`, it outputs the value of `result` but does not change the state of any variables.

Therefore, the output state includes the value of `result` based on the conditions described above.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is either `n - (n % 10)` if `n % 10` ≤ 5, or `n + (10 - (n % 10))` if `n % 10` > 5.**
