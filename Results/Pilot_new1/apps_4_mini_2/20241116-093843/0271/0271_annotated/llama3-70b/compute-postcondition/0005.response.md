The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10, `n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 5 (inclusive). Thus, `n - n % 10` will result in `n` rounded down to the nearest lower multiple of 10.

Let’s denote the value of `n` as `k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9, `k` is not divisible by 10, and `k % 10` is between 1 and 5. Therefore, the output state will show the modified value of `n` after the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and the value of `n - n % 10` is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.**
