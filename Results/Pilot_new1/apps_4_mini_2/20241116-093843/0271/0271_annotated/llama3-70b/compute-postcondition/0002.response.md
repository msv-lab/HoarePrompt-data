The code executes a print statement that displays the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9 and is divisible by 10, its specific value is printed without altering any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` retains its original value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10**
