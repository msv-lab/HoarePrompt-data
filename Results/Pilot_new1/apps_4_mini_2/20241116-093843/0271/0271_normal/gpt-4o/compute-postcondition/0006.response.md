Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `remainder` (which is `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is `n - remainder`, effectively rounding `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`, rounding `n` up to the next multiple of 10. This ensures that `result` is always a multiple of 10 within the range of 0 to 10^9.***
