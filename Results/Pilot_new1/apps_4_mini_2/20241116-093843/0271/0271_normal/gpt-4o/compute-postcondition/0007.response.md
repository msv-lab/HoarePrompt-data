To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet. 

The code snippet involves printing the variable `result`, which is derived from the variable `n` based on the conditions involving `remainder`, calculated as `n % 10`. 

1. **Understanding the Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9.
   - `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`.

2. **Calculating `result`**:
   - If `remainder` (i.e., `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is `n - remainder`.
   - If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`.

3. **Effect of Code**: 
   - The code `print(result)` will output the value of `result`, but does not modify any variables.

Since the specific value of `n` is not provided, we cannot compute an exact numeric value for `result`. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the conditions outlined.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is either `n - (n % 10)` if `n % 10` ≤ 5 or `n + (10 - (n % 10))` if `n % 10` > 5, and `print(result)` outputs the value of `result`.**
