Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop checks pairs of characters from the start and end of the string `s` for equality, with `i` ranging from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`. If any pair of characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal, the function returns False. If the loop completes without returning, it implies that `s` is a palindrome. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the function would return True by default if not handled otherwise. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and the function would also not handle this case properly.**
