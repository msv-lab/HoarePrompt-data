Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user and checks whether it is a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not handle edge cases for empty strings, but since the input length is between 1 and 1000, it is expected to process valid strings only. **
