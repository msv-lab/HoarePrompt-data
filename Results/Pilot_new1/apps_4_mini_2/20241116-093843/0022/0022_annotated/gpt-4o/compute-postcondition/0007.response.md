Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the character at the middle index `i` of `s` does not match the character at the corresponding position from the end of the string (`s[n - 1 - i]`), the function returns False. If the characters match, the function continues execution without returning False.***
