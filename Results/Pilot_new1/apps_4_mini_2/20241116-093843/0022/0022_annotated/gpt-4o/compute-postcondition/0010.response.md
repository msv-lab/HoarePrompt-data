Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not equal the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False; otherwise, the execution continues without returning any value. This means that if `s` is of even length and the characters at the specified indices match, it suggests a potential symmetry in the string, while a mismatch indicates it is not symmetric at those positions.***
