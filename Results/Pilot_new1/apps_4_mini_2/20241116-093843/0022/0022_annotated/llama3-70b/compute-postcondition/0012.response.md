According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. 

Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` is at least 1, and when `i` is incremented to 2, it will be equal to `n // 2` if `n` is 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4. 

In summary, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`. The value of `i` will increment to 2 in the next iteration, and `is_palindrome` remains unchanged since it is still True.

State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 2**
