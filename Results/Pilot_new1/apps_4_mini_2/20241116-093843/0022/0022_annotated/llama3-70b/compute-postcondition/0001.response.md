The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function, which assigns the value to `n`. The value of `n` will be the number of characters in the string `s`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is the length of that string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is the length of that string**
