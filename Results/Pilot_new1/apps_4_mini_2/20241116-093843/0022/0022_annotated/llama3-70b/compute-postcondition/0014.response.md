The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
