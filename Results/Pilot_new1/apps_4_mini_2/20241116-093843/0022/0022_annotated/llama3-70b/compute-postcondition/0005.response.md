The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `is_palindrome` is `True`, but since `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to `False`, indicating that the string `s` is not a palindrome. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
