The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `is_palindrome`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `is_spalindrome` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is False**.
