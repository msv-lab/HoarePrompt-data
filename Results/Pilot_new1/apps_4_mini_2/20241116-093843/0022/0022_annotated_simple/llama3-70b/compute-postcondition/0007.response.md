Postcondition: ***`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If the characters are equal, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged as True, and further checks would continue if applicable.***
