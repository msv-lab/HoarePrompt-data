The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0, the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
