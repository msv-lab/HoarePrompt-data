Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `color` is the second integer in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers, and if `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, it is now initialized to 0. If `color` was already in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
