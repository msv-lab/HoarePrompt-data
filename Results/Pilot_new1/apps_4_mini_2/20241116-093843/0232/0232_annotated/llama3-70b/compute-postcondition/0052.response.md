Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` for at least one `j` in the range from `i` to `n - 1`. If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `n` is 0, `found` remains False, `i` is 0, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary. If `n` is greater than 0 and no matching counts are found, `found` remains False, and `window_counts` contains the counts of colors encountered up to `j = n - 1.`***
