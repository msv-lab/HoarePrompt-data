The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop.
