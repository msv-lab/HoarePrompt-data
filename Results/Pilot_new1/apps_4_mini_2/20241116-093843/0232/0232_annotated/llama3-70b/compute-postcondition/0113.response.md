Postcondition: ***`found` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 4, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
