Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first integer in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not already present in `color_counts`. If `color` was already present, the state of `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
