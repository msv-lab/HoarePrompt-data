Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[3]`. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, it is now added with a value of 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
