Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and `k` is a list of `m` integers with a sum between 1 and `n`. If `current_counts` matches `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, if `current_counts` does not match `desired_counts`, the function does not return any value.***
