The value at `colors[right]` is used to index into `current_counts`, incrementing the count for that specific color. The `left` variable remains unchanged at 0, and `right` is `n`, which is provided as part of the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated count for the color at index `right` in `current_counts`.

Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is n, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
