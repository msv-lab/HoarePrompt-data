Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers with a sum between 1 and `n`, and at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]` for some color in `desired_counts`. If all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for every color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
