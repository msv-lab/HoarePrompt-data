According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Given that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1, the loop can execute. However, `j` is not initialized, which means it needs to be set to the starting value of `i` for the loop to begin correctly. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `j` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
