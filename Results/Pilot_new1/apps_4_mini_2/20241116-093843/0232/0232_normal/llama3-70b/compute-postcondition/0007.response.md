Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element in `colors`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, no changes are made to `color_counts`.***
