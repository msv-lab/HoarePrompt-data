Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged; if `window_counts` values, when sorted, match `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the state of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, while `i`, `n`, and `j` retain their values of 1, greater than 2, and 2 respectively.***
