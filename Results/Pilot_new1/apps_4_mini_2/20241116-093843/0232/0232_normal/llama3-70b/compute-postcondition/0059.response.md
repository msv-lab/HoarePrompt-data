Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged, and the state of `i`, `n`, and `j` remains as `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[1]`.***
