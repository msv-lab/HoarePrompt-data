The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the elements obtained from the `input` function. The previous state of `counts` is not specified, but it will now contain integers from the input. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `colors` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is that `counts` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers obtained from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input**
