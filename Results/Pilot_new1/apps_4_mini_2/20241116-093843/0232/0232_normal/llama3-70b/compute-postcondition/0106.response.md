According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than 2, it can accommodate this increment. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `i`, as `j` will take on the value of 3 in the next iteration.

State: **`color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, `found` is set to True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, `color_counts` remains unchanged, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`.**
