The code assigns the value `0` to `color_counts[color]`. The previous value of `color_counts[color]` could either be `1` or the previous value incremented by `1`, but it is now explicitly set to `0`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in `colors`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts[color]` is now 0.**
