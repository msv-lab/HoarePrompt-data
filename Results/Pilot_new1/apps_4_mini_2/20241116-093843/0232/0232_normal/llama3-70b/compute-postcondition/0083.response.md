Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged; `window_counts` contains counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]`, with `window_counts[color]` being incremented for each color encountered. All counts in `window_counts` match the respective targets in `counts`, therefore `found` is set to True. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` empty, `found` as True, `i` as 1, and `j` not initialized.***
