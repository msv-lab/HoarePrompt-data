Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in `colors`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and if `color` is not present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
