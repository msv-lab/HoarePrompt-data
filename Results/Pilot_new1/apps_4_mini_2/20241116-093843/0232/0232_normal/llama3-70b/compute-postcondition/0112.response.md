The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color` is `colors[3]`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `color_counts` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
