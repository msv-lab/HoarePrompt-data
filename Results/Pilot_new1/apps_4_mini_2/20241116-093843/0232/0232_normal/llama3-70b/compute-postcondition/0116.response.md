Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the counts of colors found in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`, `found` is True, indicating that the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` is False, and `i` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to `1`, `window_counts` is empty and `found` is False.***
