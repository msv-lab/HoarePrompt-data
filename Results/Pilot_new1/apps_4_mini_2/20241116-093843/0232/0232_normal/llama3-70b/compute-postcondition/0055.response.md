According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the value of `i`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`, which is guaranteed since `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. 

At the beginning of the loop:
- `j` will start from `i`, which is 1.
- The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Since `j` is currently at least 0 and at most `n-1`, and `i` is set to 1, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. 

Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 1 (the value of `i`) at the start of the loop.

State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1**
