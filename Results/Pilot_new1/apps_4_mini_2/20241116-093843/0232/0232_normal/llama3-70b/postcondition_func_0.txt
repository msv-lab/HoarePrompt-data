The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by a list of `n` colors and a list of `m` target counts. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of colors that contains each unique color in the target counts with the exact frequencies specified. If such a subarray is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where `m` is greater than `n`, which could lead to incorrect behavior.
