Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding counts in `current_counts` equal to the desired counts, the function returns 'YES' and the loop does not execute. If any color in `desired_counts` has a count greater than its corresponding count in `current_counts`, the loop will execute until either all colors meet their desired counts or `left` is incremented to a point where it is no longer possible to meet the desired counts. At the end of the loop, `left` will be incremented by the number of times the loop executed, and `current_counts` will have been decremented for `colors[left]` for each iteration. If the loop exits without returning 'YES', it implies that not all colors reached their desired counts, and the final state of `current_counts` reflects the decremented counts for the colors processed.**
