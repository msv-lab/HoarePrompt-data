The value of `current_counts` at the index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` is not specified, but it is stated that `right` is equal to its previous value plus 1. Therefore, the specific index being updated in `current_counts` is based on the color associated with the new `right` index. The states of `left` and `right` are not affected by this operation, but `current_counts` is updated.

Output State: **`left` is incremented, `right` is equal to the previous value of `right` + 1, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
