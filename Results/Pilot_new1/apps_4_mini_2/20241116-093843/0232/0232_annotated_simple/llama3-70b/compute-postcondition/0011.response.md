Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `color` is the second element in the colors list, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and if `color` is not present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
