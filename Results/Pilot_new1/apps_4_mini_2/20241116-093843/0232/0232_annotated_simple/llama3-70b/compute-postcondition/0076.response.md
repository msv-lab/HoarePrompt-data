Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is n-1, `j` is n-1, `n` is greater than n-1, and `color` is set to colors[j]. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
