The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split by spaces. The `input` function accepts a string of space-separated integers, which are then converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` are not directly affected by this operation, but `counts` now holds a list of integers derived from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable and its relationship to the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers from input, and `counts` is a list of integers from input**.
