The value of `found` is assigned `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, so now `found` changes to `True`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, and `window_counts[color]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
