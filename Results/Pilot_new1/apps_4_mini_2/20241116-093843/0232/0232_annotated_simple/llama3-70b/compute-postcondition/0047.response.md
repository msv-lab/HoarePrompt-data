Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and no further action is taken regarding the loop.***
