The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is set to True, `i` is n-2, `j` is n-1, `n` is greater than n-1, and `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
