The value of `n` is updated by concatenating `t` to it. Since `n` contains the concatenation of characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, the previous value of `n` is retained, and `t` is added to it. The output state will reflect the updated value of `n`, which is now `n` concatenated with `t`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is updated to include `t`, while other variables remain unchanged.**
