Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and `n` is an empty string. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to contain the character `c`; otherwise, `n` remains an empty string.***
