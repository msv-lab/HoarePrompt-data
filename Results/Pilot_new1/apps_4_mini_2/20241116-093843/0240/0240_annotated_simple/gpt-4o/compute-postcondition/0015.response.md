The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, while `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it generates and returns all possible numbers that can be formed by inserting the string `sub` into the string `chars` at various positions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `generate_possible_numbers` is to accept a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, and return all possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, returning all possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars`.**
