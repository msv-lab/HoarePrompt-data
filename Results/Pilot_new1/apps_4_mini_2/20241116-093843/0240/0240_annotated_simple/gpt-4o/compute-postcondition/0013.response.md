According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `permutations(chars)`. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the `chars` string. Since `perm` is currently set to the third permutation of `chars`, we need to determine the next permutation in the sequence.

Given that `perm` is the third permutation, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the fourth permutation of `chars`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `candidate` is updated to reflect the new permutation and is checked for validity.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `perm` should be set to the fourth permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` should be updated to equal `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
