The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. The initial state indicates that `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, so `candidate` will now hold that same permutation as a string. The state of `chars` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
