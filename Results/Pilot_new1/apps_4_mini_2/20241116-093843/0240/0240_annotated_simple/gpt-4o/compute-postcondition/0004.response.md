Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number when checked against `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. There is no action taken if `candidate` is not valid.***
