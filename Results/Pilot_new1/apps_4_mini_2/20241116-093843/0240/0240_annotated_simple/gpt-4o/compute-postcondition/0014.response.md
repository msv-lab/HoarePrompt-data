Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. The loop generates all permutations of `chars` and yields those that are valid numbers according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only leading zeroes, all permutations may also be invalid if `sub` does not allow such numbers, resulting in no candidates being yielded.**
