`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all elements of the iterable `perm` into a single string. The value of `perm` is already defined as the third permutation of `chars`, and since `candidate` is set to be the same as `perm`, it takes on that value. The state of `chars` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`**
