Output State: **If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will iterate through all permutations of `chars`. After executing, `perm` will be the current permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` will be the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is valid according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, it will yield `candidate`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and there are no permutations to consider, leaving `perm` undefined and no `candidate` generated.**
