Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 digit, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, the function does not yield anything.***
