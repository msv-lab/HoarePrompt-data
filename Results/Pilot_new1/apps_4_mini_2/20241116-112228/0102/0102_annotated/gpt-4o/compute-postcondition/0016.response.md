Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and `n` is an integer such that n is less than 0 or greater than 9. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens[n - 10]`. If `n` is in the range of 10 to 99, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens-ones' for non-multiples of ten, where `tens[n // 10]` represents the tens place and `ones[n % 10]` represents the ones place, or just the string representation of the tens place if `n` is a multiple of 10. If `n` is outside the range of 10 to 99, the function does not execute the if block and does not return a value.***
