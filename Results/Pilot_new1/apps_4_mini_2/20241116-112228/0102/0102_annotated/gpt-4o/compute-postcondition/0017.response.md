Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representation of `s` in the format 'tens-ones' for non-multiples of ten, or just the string representation of the tens place if `s` is a multiple of 10. If `s` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not execute the if block and does not return a value.***
