Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place corresponding to `n // 10`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]'. If `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not execute any return statement, and the program's behavior is not defined for those cases.***
