The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `wait_time` while maintaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`; `wait_time` is 0**.
