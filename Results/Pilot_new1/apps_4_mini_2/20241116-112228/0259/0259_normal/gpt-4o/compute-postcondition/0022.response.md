Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This ensures that `wait_time` is always a non-negative integer.***
