The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i`) remain unchanged as the code only affects `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, `i` is `n`, and `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, `i` is `n`, and `wait_time` is 0**
