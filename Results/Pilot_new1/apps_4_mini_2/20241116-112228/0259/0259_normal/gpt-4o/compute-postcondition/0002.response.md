According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Since `n` is given as a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting index for the loop. The other variables are not directly affected by the loop's execution, but they are relevant for the loop's body.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
