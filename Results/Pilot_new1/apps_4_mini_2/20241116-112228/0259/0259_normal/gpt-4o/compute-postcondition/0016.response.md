Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000. If `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. All scenarios are accounted for, including cases where `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`, and the conditions under which `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.***
