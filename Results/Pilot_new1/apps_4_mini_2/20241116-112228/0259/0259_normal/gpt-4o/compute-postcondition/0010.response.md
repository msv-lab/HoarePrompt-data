Given the initial state, the code snippet computes the wait time for a bus route based on the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. The calculation of `wait_time` involves the modulo operation and subtraction.

The initial state indicates that:
- `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that `1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000`
- `min_wait_time` is positive infinity
- `chosen_route` is -1
- `i` is 0
- `s_i` is less than `t`
- The value of `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0

The line of code `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the wait time for the bus based on the current route's departure time `d_i` and the time `t` minus the start time `s_i`. 

Since `s_i < t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, we can assume that `d_i` is a positive integer greater than zero, which will yield a valid wait time.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculated `wait_time` based on the provided conditions. However, since specific values for `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided, we can only describe the output state in general terms.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000; `min_wait_time` is positive infinity; `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is 0; `s_i` is less than `t`; wait_time is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
