The value of `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]` and is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The other variables remain unaffected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.
