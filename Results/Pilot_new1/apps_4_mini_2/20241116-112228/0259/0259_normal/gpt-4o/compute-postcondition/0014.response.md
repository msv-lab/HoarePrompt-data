The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous value of `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, but since `min_wait_time` is being set to `wait_time`, the new value of `min_wait_time` will be equal to the previous value of `wait_time`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.**
