Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` reflects the minimum waiting time calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`, covering all scenarios including when the bus departs after or at time `t`, when it arrives exactly at time `t`, and when the next bus arrives after time `t`. In all cases, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer.***
