The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers \(s_i\) and \(d_i\) such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\).

After executing the function body, the program returns the index of the chosen bus route that offers the minimum wait time, which is referred to as `chosen_route`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), t (a positive integer), and bus_routes (a list of tuples of positive integers), and returns the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time.**
