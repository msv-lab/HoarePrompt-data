The code `buses.append((s, d))` adds a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` already contains two tuples, and `s` and `d` are assigned input integers. Therefore, after executing the code, `buses` will contain three tuples: the original two tuples plus the new tuple `(s, d)`.

The other variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d), (s, d), (s, d)]`**
