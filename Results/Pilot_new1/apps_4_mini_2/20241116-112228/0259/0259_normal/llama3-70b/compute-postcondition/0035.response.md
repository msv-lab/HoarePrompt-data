Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads input for the number of buses `n` and the current time `t`. It then collects `n` tuples of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` for each bus. The function calculates the minimum time until the next bus departs based on the formula `(t - s) % d`, and it returns the 1-based index of the bus with the earliest next departure. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0 or negative), it will return -1. If all buses have a departure time greater than or equal to the current time, the index will remain -1, indicating no buses are available.**
