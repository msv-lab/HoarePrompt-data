The values of `n` and `t` are assigned the values from `input()`, which is split and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n` and `t` remain within their defined ranges, so the output state reflects that `n` and `t` are now specific positive integers based on user input. Other variables (`s_i` and `d_i`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer**
