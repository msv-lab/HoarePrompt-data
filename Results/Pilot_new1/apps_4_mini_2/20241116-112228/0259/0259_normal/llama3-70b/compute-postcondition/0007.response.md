The `buses` list is modified by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it. The previous values of `s` and `d` are input integers, and `buses` originally contains one tuple `[(s, d)]`. After the execution of the code, `buses` will now contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list of buses.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d), (s, d)]**
