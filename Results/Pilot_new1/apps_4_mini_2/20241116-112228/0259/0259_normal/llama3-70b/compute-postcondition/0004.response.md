The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The previous values of `s` and `d` are input integers, and since `buses` is initially an empty list, after the execution, `buses` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(s, d)`. The other variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d)]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d)]**
