According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. Since `buses` contains `n` tuples and `n` is currently 0, the loop cannot execute because there are no elements to iterate over. To enable the loop to execute, `buses` must contain at least 1 tuple. Additionally, the index `i` should be initialized to 0, and the first tuple `(s, d)` should be the first tuple in `buses`. 

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple of integers `(s, d)`, `min_time` is float('inf'), `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
