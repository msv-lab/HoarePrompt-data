The `buses` list is modified by appending a tuple `(s, d)` to it. Since `buses` is initially an empty list, after the execution of the code, `buses` will contain one tuple consisting of the values of `s` and `d`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`**
