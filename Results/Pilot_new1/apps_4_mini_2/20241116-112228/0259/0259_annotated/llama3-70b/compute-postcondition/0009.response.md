The line of code `s, d = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts them into integers, assigning them to `s` and `d` respectively. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown, as they are input values. The state of `n` and the list `buses` is not affected by this line directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s` and `d`, which are now input integers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 100; `s` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; and a tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses**.
