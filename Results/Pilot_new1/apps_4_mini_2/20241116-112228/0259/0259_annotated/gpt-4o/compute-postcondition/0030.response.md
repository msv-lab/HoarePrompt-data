The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state specifies that `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, and `d_i` hold certain values based on previous operations, but they are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is updated if `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is 0**.
