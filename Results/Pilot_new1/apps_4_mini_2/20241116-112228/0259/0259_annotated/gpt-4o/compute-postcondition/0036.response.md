Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), and `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged and `chosen_route` does not get updated. This ensures that the program accurately reflects the minimum wait time for the chosen route based on the bus schedule, considering all possible values of `wait_time` relative to `min_wait_time`.***
