Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), and `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. In all cases, `min_wait_time` is updated if the calculated `wait_time` is less than its previous value, and `chosen_route` is updated to `n`, with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. This ensures that the program accurately reflects the minimum wait time for the chosen route based on the bus schedule.***
