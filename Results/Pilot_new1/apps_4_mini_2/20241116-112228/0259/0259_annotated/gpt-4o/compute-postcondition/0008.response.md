The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables, and all other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0], and `wait_time` is 0.
