According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value (which is `n - 1` in a zero-indexed loop). Since `n` is a positive integer, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is the termination condition of the loop. 

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration of the loop, `i` should be incremented to `n`, and since the loop will not execute again after reaching `n`, there is no need to adjust `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, or any other state variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, `chosen_route` remains unchanged, `i` is n**
