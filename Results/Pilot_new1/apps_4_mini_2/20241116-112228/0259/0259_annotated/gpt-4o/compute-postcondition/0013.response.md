Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is a float representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0]. The `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, indicating that a more optimal waiting time has been found for the bus.***
