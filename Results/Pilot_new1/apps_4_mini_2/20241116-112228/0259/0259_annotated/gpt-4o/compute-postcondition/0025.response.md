The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, so `chosen_route` will now hold the new value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is not specified, but it can be inferred that `chosen_route` will be one greater than the previous value of `i`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.**
