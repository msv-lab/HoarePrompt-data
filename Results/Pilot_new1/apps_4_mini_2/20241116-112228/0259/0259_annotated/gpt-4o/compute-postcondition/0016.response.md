Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is a non-negative float representing the minimum wait time calculated from the bus schedule, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1` if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. This indicates that the bus route corresponding to the index `i` is chosen based on the shortest wait time. If no route has a shorter wait time than the current `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
