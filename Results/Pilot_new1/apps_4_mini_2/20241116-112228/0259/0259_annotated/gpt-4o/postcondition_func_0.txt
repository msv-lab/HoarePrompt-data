The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list `bus_routes` containing tuples of start times and intervals for each bus route. It calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given time `t` and returns the 1-based index of the route with the shortest wait time. If there are no routes (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating no available routes.
