Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, and `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`. If `time` calculated as (t - s) % d is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 1. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, there is no change to `min_time` or `ans`.***
