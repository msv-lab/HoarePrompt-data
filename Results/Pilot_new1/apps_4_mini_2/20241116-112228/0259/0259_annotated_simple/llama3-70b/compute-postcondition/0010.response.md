The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state specifies that `buses` contains two tuples, and since `s` and `d` are input integers, they will be added as a new tuple in the list. The values of `n`, `t`, and the existing tuples in `buses` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the new tuple to the list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains three tuples, and the new tuple `(s, d)` has been added.**
