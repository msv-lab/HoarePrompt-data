The line of code `s, d = map(int, input().split())` takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, converts those parts into integers, and assigns them to the variables `s` and `d`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `buses` contains two tuples, but these variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s` and `d` as input integers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples, and `s` and `d` are input integers**
