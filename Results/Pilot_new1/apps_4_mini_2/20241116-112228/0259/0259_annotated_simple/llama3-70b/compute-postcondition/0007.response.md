The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` contains one tuple, and the values of `s` and `d` are input integers. After executing the code, the list `buses` will now contain two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`. The other variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple `(s, d)`**
