Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `chosen_route` is 2. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is non-negative and respects the boundaries defined by `min_wait_time`. Additionally, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged unless the newly calculated `wait_time` is less than it. Values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`.***
