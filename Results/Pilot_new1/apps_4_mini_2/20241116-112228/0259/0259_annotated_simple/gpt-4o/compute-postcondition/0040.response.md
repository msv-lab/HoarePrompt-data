The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, with a constraint of 1 <= n <= 100. The parameter `t` is also a positive integer representing the time at which the person arrives at the bus stop, with a constraint of 1 <= t <= 100000. The parameter `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000), representing the first bus arrival time and the interval between buses for each route. After executing the function body, it returns the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, which is stored in `chosen_route`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the arrival time at the bus stop, and a list of bus route definitions, and return the index of the bus route with the least waiting time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (arrival time), and bus_routes (a list of bus route definitions), and returns the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time.**
