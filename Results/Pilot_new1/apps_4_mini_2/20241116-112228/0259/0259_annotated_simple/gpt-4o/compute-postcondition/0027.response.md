According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, which means there are additional iterations available. However, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.

Since `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 with each iteration, if the loop has completed one iteration, `i` would be 1 at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already greater than 2, it does not need to be changed. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2**
