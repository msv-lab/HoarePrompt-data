The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so we cannot determine the exact value of `chosen_route`. However, the state of `min_wait_time` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unknown increment of `i` and the unchanged state of `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
