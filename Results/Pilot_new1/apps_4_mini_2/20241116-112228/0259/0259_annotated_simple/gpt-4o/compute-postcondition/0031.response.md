To evaluate the impact of the provided code, we analyze the variables involved:

1. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.
2. `chosen_route` is 2, which suggests that `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from `bus_routes[2]`.
3. `n` is greater than 2, indicating that we are working with a valid route index.

The line of code calculates `wait_time` as follows:
- `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`

This expression computes the wait time based on the departure interval `d_i` and the current time adjusted by the start time `s_i`. The modulo operation `(t - s_i) % d_i` determines how much time has passed since the last bus (or the next bus's departure time based on the current time).

Since we do not have the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[2]`, we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `wait_time`. However, we can infer that `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer since it represents a duration until the next bus arrives.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the known variable states and the computed `wait_time`:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**.
