The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, the calculation will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i`. 

The value of `wait_time` will be computed based on the formula provided. The other variables, including `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `n`, remain unchanged unless the computed `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. 

However, since we do not have specific values for `s_i` and `d_i`, we cannot determine the exact output for `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the impact of the code without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` remains unchanged unless `wait_time` is less than it, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
