The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of bus routes), an integer `t` (the arrival time), and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the start time and interval of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus based on the provided routes and returns the 1-based index of the bus route that offers this minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes (i.e., `n` is 0), the function will return -1, indicating no available routes. If all buses have already departed before time `t`, it will still calculate wait times based on the intervals of the bus routes.
