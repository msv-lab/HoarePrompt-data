The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list to the two ends of the list (index `0` and index `n-1`) and prints this maximum distance. However, it does not handle cases where `1` or `n` is not present in the list, which would raise a ValueError.
