The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `a`. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraint that it is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and the list `a` must contain `n` distinct integers, each ranging from 1 to `n`, representing a permutation of size `n`. The function processes the input and produces an output based on the provided constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n), representing a permutation of size n.**
