The code assigns `max_pos` the value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The variable `n` is an input integer within the specified range, and since `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `max_pos` will hold the position of `n` in `a`. If `n` is not present in the list, this will raise a ValueError, but for the sake of this task, we will assume `n` exists in `a`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer within the specified range, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer within the specified range, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`**.
