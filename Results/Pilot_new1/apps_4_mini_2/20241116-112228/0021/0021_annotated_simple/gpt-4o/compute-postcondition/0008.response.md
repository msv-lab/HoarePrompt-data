The variable `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `dist2` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)` and `dist3` is calculated as `abs(0 - min_pos)`, and `dist4` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. Since `dist1` is not defined in the initial state, its value is unknown.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the known calculations and the fact that `max_distance` is determined based on the maximum of the given distances.

Output State: **`max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, where `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos), `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos), and `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos**
