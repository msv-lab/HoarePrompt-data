The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (with the condition that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, each ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list `a`, then computes the distances from these positions to both ends of the list (index 0 and index `n-1`). The maximum of these distances is then printed as the output. 

However, the function does not handle potential edge cases such as:
- If the input list `a` does not contain the integers 1 or `n`, which would raise a `ValueError` when calling `index()`.
- It does not check if the input list `a` has the correct number of elements (i.e., it should contain exactly `n` elements).

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers, calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` to the ends of the list, and prints this maximum distance. It does not handle cases where 1 or `n` are not present in the list or where the list does not contain exactly `n` elements. **
