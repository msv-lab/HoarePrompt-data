To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code performs the following steps:
1. Reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from input.
2. Finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array `a`.
3. Calculates the distances from the minimum and maximum elements to both ends of the array (index 0 and index n-1).
4. Determines the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Key Points:
- The program calculates the distances from the positions of 1 and n to both ends of the array. 
- It assumes that swapping either of these elements with an element at the opposite end will yield the maximum distance.
- The logic does not explicitly check if performing the swap actually results in the minimum and maximum being at the ends, nor does it consider if they are already at the ends.

### Potential Issue:
Let's consider a case where the minimum and maximum are already at the ends:
- For example, with the input:
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
  Here, the minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (4) is at index 3. The distance is already 3, and any swap will not improve this distance. The program will still compute a maximum distance of 3, but it does not account for the fact that we are required to perform a swap. 

In this case, although the distance is maximum, the requirement of performing a swap is not handled correctly, leading to the conclusion that the output should reflect the fact that the distance cannot be increased by a swap.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle the requirement of performing exactly one swap when the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array, we conclude that there is a logical flaw.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
