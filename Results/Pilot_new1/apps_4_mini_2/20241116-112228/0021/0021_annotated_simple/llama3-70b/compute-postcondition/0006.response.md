The code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. Since `max_dist` and `min_dist` are dependent on previous calculations, but their specific values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact output. However, we know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `min_dist` depends on the unspecified value of `pos1`. The output state will reflect the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `min_dist` is dependent on the unknown value of `pos1`; the output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
