To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

The problem states that we have a permutation of integers from 1 to n and we want to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads an integer `n` and then reads a list of `n` distinct integers.
2. **Finding Positions**: It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and maximum element (n) in the list.
3. **Calculating Distances**: 
   - It calculates `max_dist` as the maximum of the absolute difference between the positions of 1 and n minus 1, and `n - 2`.
   - It calculates `min_dist` as the minimum of the absolute difference between the positions of 1 and n minus 1, and `n - 2`.
4. **Final Output**: It prints the maximum of `max_dist` and the difference `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Distance Calculation Logic**: The way `max_dist` and `min_dist` are calculated does not correctly account for the actual swap that would maximize the distance between the positions of 1 and n. The logic of subtracting 1 and using `n - 2` is not valid for all cases.
  
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case when 1 and n are already at the ends of the array. For instance:
   - If the input is `2` followed by `1 2`, the maximum distance is already `1`, but the program's logic does not reflect that correctly because it is not performing the swap accurately.

3. **Incorrect Output for Certain Cases**: 
   - For the input `3` followed by `1 2 3`, the expected output is `2` (by swapping 2 and 3), but the program may not yield this correctly due to the flawed distance calculation.

### Example Test Case:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 3 2
```
- The program will find positions: `pos1 = 0` (for 1) and `posn = 1` (for 3).
- The absolute difference is `abs(0 - 1) = 1`. 
- The program calculates `max_dist` and `min_dist` incorrectly, leading to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:

Given the flaws in the distance calculation and handling of edge cases, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
