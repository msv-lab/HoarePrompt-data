To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: 
   - An integer `n` representing the size of the permutation.
   - A list of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`.

2. **Output**: 
   - An integer representing the maximum possible distance between the minimum (1) and the maximum (n) elements after exactly one swap.

3. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - The distance between two elements is defined as the absolute difference between their positions in the array.

### Program Logic:
- The program finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the array.
- It calculates the distance from both the minimum and maximum elements to both ends of the array (indices 0 and n-1).
- It then takes the maximum of these distances.

### Potential Issues:
The program does not explicitly simulate the swap or check the resulting distances after performing the swap. It only calculates potential distances without considering the actual swap of elements.

### Example Cases:
Let's consider a test case to see if the program behaves as expected.

#### Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Here, the minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (5) is at index 4.
- The current distance is `abs(0 - 4) = 4`.
- The program will calculate the distances to the ends:
  - `dist1` (from 0 to max_pos): 4
  - `dist2` (from n-1 to max_pos): 0
  - `dist3` (from 0 to min_pos): 0
  - `dist4` (from n-1 to min_pos): 4
- The maximum distance calculated is `max(4, 0, 0, 4) = 4`.

However, if we swap the minimum (1) with the maximum (5), the array becomes:
```
5 2 3 4 1
```
- The new positions are: min at index 4, max at index 0.
- The new distance is `abs(0 - 4) = 4`, which is the same as before.

Now consider a case where the minimum and maximum are not at the ends, for example:
```
5
2 1 3 4 5
```
- The minimum (1) is at index 1 and the maximum (5) is at index 4.
- The program calculates the distances:
  - `dist1` (from 0 to max_pos): 4
  - `dist2` (from n-1 to max_pos): 0
  - `dist3` (from 0 to min_pos): 1
  - `dist4` (from n-1 to min_pos): 3
- The maximum distance calculated is `max(4, 0, 1, 3) = 4`.

But if we swap elements (1) and (5), the array becomes:
```
5 2 3 4 1
```
- The new distance is still `abs(0 - 4) = 4`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the effect of the swap on the positions of the elements. It only calculates potential distances without actually simulating the swap and verifying the new positions of the minimum and maximum. Therefore, it may not yield the correct maximum distance in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
