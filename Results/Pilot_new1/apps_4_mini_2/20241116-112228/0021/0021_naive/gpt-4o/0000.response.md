To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem requires maximizing the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.

The program does the following:
1. It reads the size of the permutation `n`.
2. It reads the permutation array `a`.
3. It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n).
4. It calculates four possible distances:
   - Distance from the start of the array (index 0) to the maximum element's position.
   - Distance from the end of the array (index n-1) to the maximum element's position.
   - Distance from the start of the array (index 0) to the minimum element's position.
   - Distance from the end of the array (index n-1) to the minimum element's position.
5. It finds the maximum of these distances and prints it.

However, the program does not consider the actual effect of performing a swap. The maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements is not simply the maximum of these four distances. The program fails to account for the requirement that a swap must be performed to achieve the maximum distance.

**Potential Case:**
Consider the permutation `a = [1, 3, 2, 4]` with `n = 4`. 
- The positions of 1 and 4 are `0` and `3`, respectively.
- The maximum distance without considering a swap would be `3` (from position 0 to position 3).
- However, if we swap `1` with `4`, the array becomes `[4, 3, 2, 1]`, and the distance becomes `3`.
- But if we swap `2` with `4`, the array becomes `[1, 3, 4, 2]`, and the distance becomes `2`.
- The program would output `3`, which does not reflect the maximum achievable distance after a swap.

Thus, the logic does not correctly account for the requirement of performing a swap to achieve the maximum distance.

Correctness: **False**.
