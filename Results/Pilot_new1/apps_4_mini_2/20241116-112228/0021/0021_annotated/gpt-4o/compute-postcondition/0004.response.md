The variable `dist1` is assigned the value `abs(0 - max_pos)`, which calculates the absolute distance from index 0 to the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The value of `max_pos` is determined by the position of `n` in the list `a`. Since `max_pos` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it is an integer index corresponding to the position of `n` in the list. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `dist1` based on the unknown `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos)**
