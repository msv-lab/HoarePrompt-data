Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
