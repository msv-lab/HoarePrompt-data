The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine any return values or conditions based on the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers based on the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
