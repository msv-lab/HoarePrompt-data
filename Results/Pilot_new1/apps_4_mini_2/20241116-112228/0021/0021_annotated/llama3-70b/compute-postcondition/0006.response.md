To determine the output state based on the given initial state and code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved and the impact of the code.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `pos1` is the index of the value `1` in the list `a`.
   - `posn` is the index of the value `n` in the list `a`.
   - `min_dist` is calculated as \( \min(\lvert pos1 - posn \rvert - 1, n - 2) \).

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code calculates \( \max(max\_dist, n - 1 - min\_dist) \).
   - However, we need to note that `max_dist` is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot compute the value of `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` without knowing the value of `max_dist`.

3. **Impact on Output State**:
   - Since `max_dist` is undefined, we cannot produce a numeric output from the print statement.
   - The other variables remain unchanged.

Since we cannot calculate the output due to the undefined variable, we will state that the output reflects the current state of the defined variables and the inability to compute the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list a; `posn` is the index of the value n in the list a; `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `max_dist` is undefined.**
