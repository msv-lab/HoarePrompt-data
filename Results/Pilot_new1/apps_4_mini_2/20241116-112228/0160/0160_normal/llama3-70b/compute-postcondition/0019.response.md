According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is at least 1, and therefore `math.sqrt(gcd)` is at least 1, meaning `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1. The current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

To allow the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it should now be `k + 1`. The loop can continue as long as `k + 1` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now `k + 1`, and the maximum value of `i` should be `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is at least 1, `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`**
