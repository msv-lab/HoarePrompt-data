According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gcd`. The loop iterates from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, which means for the loop to execute, `gcd` must be at least `1`. 

Given that `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, and since `A` is a non-empty list of integers, `gcd` will always be at least `1` if the integers in `A` are positive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be at least `1`, since the loop starts at `1`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `gcd` is at least `1`, `i` starts at `1`, and the loop will iterate up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is 1**
