Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, and `max_divisor` is at least 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `gcd` is not a perfect square, `max_divisor` is also updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, the value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
