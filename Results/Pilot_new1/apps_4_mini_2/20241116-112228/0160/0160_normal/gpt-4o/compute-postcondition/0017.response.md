The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer that falls within the constraints of 2 <= N <= 500, where N is the length of the list of integers A. The function returns a sorted list of the divisors of `x` in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` and return its divisors sorted in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer x and returns a sorted list of its divisors in descending order.**
