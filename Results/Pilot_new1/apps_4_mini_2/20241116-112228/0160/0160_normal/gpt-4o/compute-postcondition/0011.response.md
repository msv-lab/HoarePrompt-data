The set `divisors` is updated to include the value of `i`, which is `k + 1`. The previous state of `divisors` included `1`, `2`, and potentially `x // 2` if `x` was divisible by `2`. The value of `i` is determined by the value of `k`, which is a non-negative integer. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects the inclusion of `i` in `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` now includes `k + 1`; `x` is at least 4; `i` is `k + 1`, and `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `k + 1`.**
