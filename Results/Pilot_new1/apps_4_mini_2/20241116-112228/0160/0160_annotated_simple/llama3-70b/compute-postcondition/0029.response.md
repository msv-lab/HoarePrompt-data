According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` in relation to `gcd`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is at least `(i + 1)`, which means `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` for the loop to execute again.

If `i` is currently at a certain value, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Additionally, since the loop runs from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the condition for the loop to execute again implies that `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`. We need to set `i` to `i + 1`.

State: **`gcd` is at least `(i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
