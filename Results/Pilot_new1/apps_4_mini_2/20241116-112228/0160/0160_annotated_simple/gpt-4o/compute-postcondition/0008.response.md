The code snippet `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the result of the integer division `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `x` is not provided in the initial state, but we know that `i` is 2. Since `divisors` already includes the value 2, we will check the effect of adding `x // 2` to `divisors`.

The output state will depend on the value of `x`. If `x` is an integer such that `x // 2` is already in `divisors`, it will remain unchanged. If `x // 2` is a new value, it will be added. However, without knowing the specific value of `x`, we cannot determine the exact state of `divisors`.

Therefore, the output state will indicate that `divisors` may or may not change depending on the value of `x`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes 2, `i` is 2, and `divisors` may include `x // 2` depending on the value of `x`.**
