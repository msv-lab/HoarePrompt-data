The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. 

- `N` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq N \leq 500\).
- `K` is a non-negative integer that must satisfy the constraint \(0 \leq K \leq 10^9\).
- `A` is a list of integers with a length of `N`, where each element \(A[i]\) is an integer such that \(1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^6\).

The function's output is based on the values of `N`, `K`, and the contents of the list `A`. However, the specific output conditions and values are not provided in the prompt.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer between 2 and 500), K (a non-negative integer), and A (a list of N integers each between 1 and 10^6), and returns a value based on these parameters.**
