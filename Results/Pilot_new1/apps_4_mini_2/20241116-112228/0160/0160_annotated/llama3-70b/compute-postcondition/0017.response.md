Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, and `max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd` or updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd` divided by `i`, provided that `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
