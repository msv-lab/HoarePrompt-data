The variable `A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. However, the exact contents of `A` depend on the input provided, which is unknown at this stage. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `A` but does not specify its contents.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers from input.**
