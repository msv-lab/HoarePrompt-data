According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be updated to 2.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 2**
