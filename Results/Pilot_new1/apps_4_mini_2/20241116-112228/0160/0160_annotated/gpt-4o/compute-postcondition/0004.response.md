The `divisors` set is updated to include the value of `x // i`. Since `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, `x // i` will simply be equal to `x`. The previous state of `divisors` contains 1, and now it will include `x` as well. 

The output state reflects the updated contents of `divisors` while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` now contains 1 and x, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
