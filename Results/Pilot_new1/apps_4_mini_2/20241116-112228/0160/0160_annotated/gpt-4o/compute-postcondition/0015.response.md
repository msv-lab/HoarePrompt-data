Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all divisors of `x` up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is a positive integer, `divisors` will include 1 and `x`, and potentially other divisors depending on the values of `i` during the loop's execution. If `x` is 1, `divisors` will only contain 1. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is a perfect square, `i` will be equal to `sqrt(x)` at some iteration, ensuring that `i` and `x // i` are only added once.**
