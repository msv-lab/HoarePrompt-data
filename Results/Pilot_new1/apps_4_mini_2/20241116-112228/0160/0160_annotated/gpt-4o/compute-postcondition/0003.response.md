The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is currently 1, the set `divisors` will now contain the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` now contains 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` now contains 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
