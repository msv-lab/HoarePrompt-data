The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The initial state specifies that `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`, which means it is a non-negative integer that satisfies the condition of being at least `i + 1`. The value of `divisors` is not provided, but it is implied that it is a set that can hold unique values.

Since `i` is added to the set `divisors`, the output state will reflect that `i` has been added to `divisors`, but the specific values of `divisors` before and after the operation are not known.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `i` has been added to `divisors`.**
