According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`. This means that in the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop. Therefore, `x` must be adjusted so that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is increased by 1, which requires `x` to be greater than the square of the current `i`.

Since `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`, we need to adjust `x` so that it is greater than `i^2`. This means we need to set `x` to at least `i^2 + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `x` is greater than `i^2`**.
