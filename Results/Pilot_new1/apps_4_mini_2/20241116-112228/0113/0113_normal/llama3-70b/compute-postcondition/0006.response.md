After executing the code `n += 1`, the value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is initially less than or equal to 8, the new value of `n` will be at most 9. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is less than or equal to 8, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10, and `n` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 9.

Output State: **`n` is less than or equal to 9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10**
