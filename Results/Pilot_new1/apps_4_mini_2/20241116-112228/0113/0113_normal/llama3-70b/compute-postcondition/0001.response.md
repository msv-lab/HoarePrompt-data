The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, which means `x` will be one of the powers of ten from `1` (when `k` is 0) to `100000000` (when `k` is 8). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is `10` raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is `10 ** k`**
