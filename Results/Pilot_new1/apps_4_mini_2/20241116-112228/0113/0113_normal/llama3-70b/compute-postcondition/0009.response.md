To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial conditions and the provided code snippet.

1. The initial state states that if `n` is initially a multiple of 10, then `n` remains unchanged. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, then `n` becomes the next multiple of 10, which is calculated as `n + (10 - (n % 10))`. The variable `k` remains unchanged, and `x` is assigned the value 10.

2. The code `print(n)` outputs the current value of `n`, which could either be unchanged or the next multiple of 10 based on its initial value.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `n`, we can summarize the possible scenarios:

- If `n` is a multiple of 10, `n` remains unchanged.
- If `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n` is updated to the next multiple of 10.

However, since the print statement will output the current value of `n`, we can conclude that the output state will reflect the value of `n` as it is after the condition is evaluated.

Output State: **`n` is either unchanged or updated to the next multiple of 10, `k` remains unchanged, `x` is 10**
