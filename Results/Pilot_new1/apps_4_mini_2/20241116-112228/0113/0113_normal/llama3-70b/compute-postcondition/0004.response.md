The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, it will still not be a multiple of 10 after the increment. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is not a multiple of 10, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10, and `n` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is not a multiple of 10, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10, and `n` is incremented by 1**
