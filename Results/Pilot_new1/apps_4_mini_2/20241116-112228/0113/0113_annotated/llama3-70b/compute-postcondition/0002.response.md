The value of `n` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `n` is a positive integer based on input, so after execution, `n` becomes `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on input (now `n + 1`), `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input (now `n + 1`), `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
