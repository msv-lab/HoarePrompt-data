The value of `n` is incremented by 1, changing its previous state. Since `n` was such that `n % x` is not equal to 0, the new value of `n` will still not be divisible by `x`. The output state reflects the updated value of `n`, while `x` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is now incremented by 1, `n % x` is still not equal to 0**
