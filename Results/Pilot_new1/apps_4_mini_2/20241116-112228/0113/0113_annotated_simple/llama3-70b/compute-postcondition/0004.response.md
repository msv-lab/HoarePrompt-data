The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state states that `n + 1` is not divisible by \(10^k\), after incrementing, the new value of `n` becomes `n + 1`. The divisibility condition does not change with this operation, so the output state reflects the new value of `n` without affecting other variables.

Output State: **`n` is such that `n` is now `n + 1`, and `n + 1` is not divisible by 10^k**
