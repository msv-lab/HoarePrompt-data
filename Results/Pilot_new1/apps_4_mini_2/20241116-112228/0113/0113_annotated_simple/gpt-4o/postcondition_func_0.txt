The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as \(10^k\), and returns the value of \(x\) which is computed as \(n\) multiplied by the integer division of the multiplier by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(n\) and the multiplier. Note that the function assumes `n` is positive and `k` is non-negative, but it does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected results in contexts where these values are passed.
