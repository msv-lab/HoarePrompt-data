Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the function prints -1, indicating that the balance cannot change. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints the number of iterations required to reach the balance from `x`, calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `(x - balance)` is not divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function still prints the same number of iterations, adjusted accordingly.***
