Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `count` is initialized to 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition is satisfied. If `(x - b)` is not divisible by `balance`, or if `(x - b) // balance` is negative, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
