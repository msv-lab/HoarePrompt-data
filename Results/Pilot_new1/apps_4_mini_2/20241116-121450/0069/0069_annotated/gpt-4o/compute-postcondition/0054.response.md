To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `i` is given as 2.
2. We need to look at the values of `prefix_balances[1]` and `prefix_balances[2]`. 
   - `prefix_balances[1]` can be either 1 or -1.
   - `prefix_balances[2]` can be either 2, 0, or -2.
3. The code updates `prefix_balances[i]`, which is `prefix_balances[2]`, using the formula:
   ```
   prefix_balances[2] = prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)
   ```
4. The value of `s[i - 1]` is `s[1]`, but we do not have the value of `s` provided. Therefore, we cannot determine whether `s[1]` is '0' or not, which affects the calculation.

Given that we have two cases for `prefix_balances[1]` (1 or -1) and two possible outcomes for the conditional expression depending on the value of `s[1]`, we can outline the possible values for `prefix_balances[2]`:

- If `prefix_balances[1]` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then:
  ```
  prefix_balances[2] = 1 + 1 = 2
  ```
- If `prefix_balances[1]` is 1 and `s[1]` is not '0', then:
  ```
  prefix_balances[2] = 1 - 1 = 0
  ```
- If `prefix_balances[1]` is -1 and `s[1]` is '0', then:
  ```
  prefix_balances[2] = -1 + 1 = 0
  ```
- If `prefix_balances[1]` is -1 and `s[1]` is not '0', then:
  ```
  prefix_balances[2] = -1 - 1 = -2
  ```

Thus, the possible values for `prefix_balances[2]` can be 2, 0, or -2 depending on the initial values and the value of `s[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `i` is 2**
