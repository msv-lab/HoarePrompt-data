Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 2; otherwise, `count` remains 1. This means that `x` must be such that the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` for `count` to increase.***
