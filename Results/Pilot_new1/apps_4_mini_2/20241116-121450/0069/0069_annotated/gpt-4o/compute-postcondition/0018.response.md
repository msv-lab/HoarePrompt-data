According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently 3 (as it is the next value to be used in the loop based on the range). 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (which allows `i` to take the value of 3) and after the next iteration, `i` will increment to 4. Therefore, to adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`; `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3**
