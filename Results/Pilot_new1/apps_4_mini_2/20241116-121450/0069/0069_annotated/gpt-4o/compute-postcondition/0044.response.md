The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous state of `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1, and `T` is greater than the number of completed iterations. The value of `x` is now defined based on the data at `index + 1`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` includes -1, and `T` is greater than the number of completed iterations.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` includes -1, and `T` is greater than the number of completed iterations**
