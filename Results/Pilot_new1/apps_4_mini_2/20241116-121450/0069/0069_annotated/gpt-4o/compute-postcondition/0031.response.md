Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `count` is initialized to 0, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains 0. Additionally, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, and `balance` is not equal to 0.***
