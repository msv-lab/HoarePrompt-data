The code initializes an empty list `results`. The variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `data` remain unchanged, and `index` is still 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `results` while noting that other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100); `n`, `x`, `s`, and `data` are unchanged; `index` is 1; `results` is an empty list.**
