According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. For the loop to execute, the list must contain at least one element. Given that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, it will always have at least one element as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, the variable `b` will iterate through each element in `prefix_balances`. 

Since `balance` is stated to be not equal to 0, it indicates that there is some imbalance in the counts of '0's and '1's in the string represented by the cumulative balances. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute:
- `prefix_balances` must have at least one element (which it does, since it has length `n + 1`).
- `b` will start from the first element of `prefix_balances`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `count` is initialized to 0, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0**
