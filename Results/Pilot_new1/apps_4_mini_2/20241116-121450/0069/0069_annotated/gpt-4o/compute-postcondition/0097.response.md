Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the result of adding 1 for each '0' and subtracting 1 for each '1' up to index `i`. `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` are equal. `n` is 0 or lower, so the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains unchanged (all zeros). The value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`.***
