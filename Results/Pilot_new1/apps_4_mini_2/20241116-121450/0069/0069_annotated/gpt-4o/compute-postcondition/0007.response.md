The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 1, so the expression evaluates to `int(data[2])`. The value of `data[2]` is unknown, which means we cannot determine the specific value of `x`. The other variables (`T`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])` which is unknown.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])` which is unknown**.
