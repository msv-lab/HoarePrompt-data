Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the result of adding 1 for each '0' and subtracting 1 for each '1' up to index `i`. `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` are equal. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, leaving `prefix_balances` unchanged (all zeros).***
