Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the program prints `-1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the printed result will depend on the specific values of `x` and `balance`, since the division by zero must be handled. Otherwise, the program prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, accounting for all cases where `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`.***
