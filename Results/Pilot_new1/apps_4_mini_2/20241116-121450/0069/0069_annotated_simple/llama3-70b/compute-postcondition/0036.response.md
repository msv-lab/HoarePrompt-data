Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the program must handle this case separately to avoid division by zero. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged.**
