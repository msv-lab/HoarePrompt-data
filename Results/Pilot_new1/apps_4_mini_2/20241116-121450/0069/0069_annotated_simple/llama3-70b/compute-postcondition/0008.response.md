Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x` (i.e., `balance` is either less than or greater than `x`).***
