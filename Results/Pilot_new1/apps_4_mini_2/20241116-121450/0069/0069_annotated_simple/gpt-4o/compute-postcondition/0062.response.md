Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `results` contains at least one element; if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` is appended with -1. Otherwise, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with 0. In both cases, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` has been increased by 3.***
