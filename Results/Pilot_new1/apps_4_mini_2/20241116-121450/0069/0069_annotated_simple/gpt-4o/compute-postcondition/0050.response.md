Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`; `results` is 0; `T` is greater than 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`; `index` is increased by 3; `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`.**
