Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `T` is at least 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. If `(x - b)` is not a non-negative multiple of `balance`, the value of `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
