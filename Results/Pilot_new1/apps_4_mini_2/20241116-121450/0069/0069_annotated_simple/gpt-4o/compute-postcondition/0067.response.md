Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, and the expression `(x - b) % balance == 0` holds true, with `(x - b) // balance >= 0` also holding true.**
