The value of `index` is increased by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in `s`, `results` contains at least one element, `T` is greater than 0, `x` is assigned from `data[index + 1]`, `n` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`, and `s` is now assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
