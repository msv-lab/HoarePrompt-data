Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100). For each iteration, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `balance` is zero, the output depends on the value of `x`: if `x` is also zero, the output is `n + 1`, otherwise it is `-1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not zero, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and is non-zero, it handles division appropriately. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and all variables retain their initial state.**
