The code snippet reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `x`. The value of `T` is not directly affected by this operation, but it indicates that `n` and `x` will be assigned values based on user input. Since `T` is a positive integer, we can assume that `n` and `x` will also be positive integers, but their specific values depend on the input provided.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers**
