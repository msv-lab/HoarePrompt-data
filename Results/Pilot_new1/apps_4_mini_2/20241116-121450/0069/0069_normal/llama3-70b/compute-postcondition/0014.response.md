Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1, indicating that the difference is perfectly divisible by the count difference. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, representing the number of additional operations needed to achieve the desired balance. This covers all scenarios based on the relationship between `x`, `balance`, and the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.***
