The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly, as it has been defined without any input arguments. However, based on the provided constraints, we can infer that it is expected to work with certain variables that must be defined or passed in a different context (potentially through global variables or user input).

Given the constraints:
- `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100).
- `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5).
- `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, without specific output conditions or behavior detailed in the output section, we cannot determine the return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but is expected to operate with a positive integer T, a positive integer n, an integer x, and a binary string s based on the constraints given. The output behavior of the function is not specified.**
