Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where the balance is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances[1]` through `prefix_balances[n]`; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.***
