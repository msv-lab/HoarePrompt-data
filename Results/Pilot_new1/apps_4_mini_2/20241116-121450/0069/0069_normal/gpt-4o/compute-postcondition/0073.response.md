The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Given that `count` can either be 0 or 1, the new value of `count` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is either 0 or 1; `count` is either 1 or 2 after the increment.

Output State: **`count` is either 0 or 1; `count` is either 1 or 2**
