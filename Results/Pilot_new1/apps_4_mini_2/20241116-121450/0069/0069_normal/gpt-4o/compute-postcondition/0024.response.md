The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. This operation does not affect the previous values of `prefix_balances`, and the state of `results` changes to include the new value. The output state indicates the current state of `prefix_balances` and the updated state of `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to n; `results` has an additional element 0 appended.**
