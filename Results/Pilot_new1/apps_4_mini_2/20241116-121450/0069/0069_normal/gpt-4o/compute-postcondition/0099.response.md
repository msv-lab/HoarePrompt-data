Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. Otherwise, `results` includes an additional element with the value 0. This accounts for the case when `n` is 0 or lower, where `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, and `results` will still be updated accordingly.***
