The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list containing input values split by whitespace, and `index` is currently 1. The value of `n` will be determined by the second element of the `data` list (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is the integer value from `data[1]`, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.
