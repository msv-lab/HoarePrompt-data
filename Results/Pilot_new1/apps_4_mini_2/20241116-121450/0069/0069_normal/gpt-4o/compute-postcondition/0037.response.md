Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all 0s, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` remains unchanged unless the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` is true and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, in which case `count` is increased by 1. This means that if the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
