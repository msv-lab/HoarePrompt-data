Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the balance of the string is zero and the desired balance `x` is also zero. According to the problem description, if the balance is zero, there can be an infinite number of prefixes with balance equal to `x` if `x` is in the set of prefix balances. However, the program only checks if `x` is in `prefix_balances` and returns `-1` if it is, which implies an infinite number of prefixes when it should instead return `-1` only if the balance is zero and `x` is zero.

For example, consider the test case:
```
1 0
00
```
Here, the balance of the string is `2` (two `0`s and zero `1`s), and thus the balance is not zero. The desired balance `x` is `0`. The correct output in this case should be `0`, as there are no prefixes of `t` that can achieve a balance of `0`. However, the program would incorrectly output `-1` if `x` were `0` and the balance were also `0`.

Thus, there are potential cases where the program does not work as expected, confirming that the program is incorrect.
