To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it step by step against the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Inputs**:
   - The inputs are `n`, `m`, `k` which represent the number of blocks (entrances), the number of floors per block, and the number of apartments per floor, respectively.
   - The inputs also include `a` and `b`, which are the apartment numbers for Edward and Natasha.

2. **Calculating the Floor and Block**:
   - The program calculates which floor and block Edward and Natasha are on using:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - This logic appears correct as it correctly calculates the block and floor numbers based on the apartment numbering system described.

3. **Calculating the Time to Move Between Blocks**:
   - The program calculates the time to move between blocks considering the circular structure:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This is also correct, as it finds the minimum time to transition between the two blocks, either clockwise or counter-clockwise.

4. **Calculating the Time to Move Between Floors**:
   - The program calculates the time to move between floors:
     ```python
     if a_floor > b_floor:
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - However, this logic seems incorrect. The time to move from one floor to another should only include the time taken to travel the floors (5 seconds per floor), plus the lift wait time (10 seconds) if Edward is using the lift. The current logic adds the lift wait time regardless of whether Edward is using the lift or stairs.

5. **Final Time Calculation**:
   - The total time is printed as the sum of the block time and floor time:
     ```python
     print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
     ```

### Potential Case:
Let's consider a specific case:
- If Edward lives on the first floor of block 1 (apartment 1) and Natasha lives on the first floor of block 2 (apartment k + 1). 
- In this case, if Edward uses the stairs, he would not need to wait for the lift, and the time to go from block 1 to block 2 should be just the time to walk to block 2 (15 seconds) and no additional time for the floor movement since they are both on the first floor.

However, the program erroneously adds a lift wait time of 10 seconds regardless, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge case where Edward is already on the same floor as Natasha correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
