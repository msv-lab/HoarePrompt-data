The variable `b_block` is assigned the value `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `b`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on user input. Since `b`, `m`, and `k` are known, `b_block` is calculated based on these values. The previous values of `a`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculated value of `b_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on user input; `a` and `b` are distinct integers based on user input; `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1; a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
