To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

The code snippet calculates `min_floor_time` based on the difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor`, multiplied by 5 and then adding 10. The values of `b_floor` and `a_floor` are not provided directly in the initial state, but we know that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.

Since `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, the expression `(b_floor - a_floor)` will yield a non-negative integer. 

The calculation for `min_floor_time` will therefore yield a non-negative value that depends on the specific values of `b_floor` and `a_floor`. However, we cannot determine the exact value without knowing those specific integers. 

Thus, the output state will reflect that `min_floor_time` has been calculated based on the relationship between `b_floor` and `a_floor`.

Output State: **`min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10**
