To provide the output state, we first need to analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the initial state. 

1. The code calculates `min_block_time` as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. This means that `min_block_time` will depend on the values of `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n`.

2. The code also calculates `min_floor_time` based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If not, it is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. 

3. Finally, the `print` statement outputs the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

However, since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_block`, `b_block`, `a_floor`, and `b_floor` are not provided in the initial state, the output state will reflect that the calculations were made based on these variables without specifying exact numerical results.

Output State: **`min_block_time` is calculated based on `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n`; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the result of `min_block_time + min_floor_time` is printed.**
