To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the problem requirements carefully.

### Problem Description Summary:
- The building has `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
- Apartments are numbered sequentially.
- Edward can move between floors and blocks in specified timeframes.
- The goal is to compute the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment from his own.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
if a_floor > b_floor:
    min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
else:
    min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

### Key Observations:
1. **Block Calculation**:
   - The calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` seems correct as it divides the apartment number by the total number of apartments per block (`m * k`).
   
2. **Floor Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the floor for both apartments is also correct, using modulo to determine the floor number.
   
3. **Block Time Calculation**:
   - The code correctly computes the minimum time to traverse between blocks, considering the circular nature of the building.

4. **Floor Time Calculation**:
   - The time to move between floors is calculated correctly, including the lift wait time.

### Edge Cases:
- The code assumes that Edward will always need to go to the first floor before moving to another block. If Edward is already on the first floor, the lift time should not add unnecessary time.
- If both apartments are on the same floor, the code should handle the transition between blocks correctly without unnecessary time penalties.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints describe the function's operation and confirm that it calculates the total time required for Edward's journey based on the block and floor calculations. The hints mention that the function prints the total time required, which aligns with the code's output.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the problem description, the code correctly computes the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment. However, the edge case regarding unnecessary time when already on the first floor could be a potential oversight. 

Since the code does not explicitly handle the case where Edward is already on the first floor, it may lead to incorrect results in that scenario.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation of Incorrectness:
The code does not account for the scenario where Edward starts on the first floor, thus leading to potential overestimation of the time required to reach Natasha's apartment. For example, if Edward and Natasha are in the same block and on the same floor, the code would still apply the lift wait time, which is incorrect.
