To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. The initial state provides that `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. 
3. The calculation for `reverse_walk_time` uses the same `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` values, but it computes a different expression based on their absolute difference.

Since the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the relationship between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` will depend on the specific values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`. Thus, the output state can only describe the relationship without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
