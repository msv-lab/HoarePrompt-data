The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The initial state does not provide the value of `apartment`, but it is implied that it is a positive integer within the range defined by `1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k`. The calculation involves taking the modulus of `apartment - 1` with respect to `m * k`, which determines the position within the block.

Since the exact value of `apartment` is not provided, the output state will reflect that the calculation is dependent on `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
