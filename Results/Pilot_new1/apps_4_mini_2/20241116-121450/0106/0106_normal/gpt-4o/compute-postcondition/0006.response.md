Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block_a` and `floor_a` are the results of get_location(a); `block_b` and `floor_b` are the results of get_location(b). If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of (`floor_a` - 1), indicating the time to exit based on the floor level.***
