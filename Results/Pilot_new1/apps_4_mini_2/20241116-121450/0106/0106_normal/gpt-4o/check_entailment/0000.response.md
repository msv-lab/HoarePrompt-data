To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Initial Assessment

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Edward lives in apartment `a` and Natasha in apartment `b`.
   - The building has `n` entrances, `m` floors per entrance, and `k` apartments per floor.
   - The task is to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha, considering the time taken to use stairs and elevators, as well as walking between entrances.

2. **Functionality of the Code:**
   - The function `get_location(apartment)` computes the entrance (block) and floor based on the apartment number.
   - The function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)` calculates:
     - Time to exit the floor (using the elevator if not already on the first floor).
     - The minimum walking time between entrances (either directly or in reverse).
     - Time to reach Natasha's floor from the first floor of her entrance.
   - The calculation seems to consider all necessary components of the journey.

### Edge Cases Consideration

- The provided code does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are zero, which could lead to division errors or incorrect calculations. However, the problem constraints guarantee that `1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000`, so this should not be an issue given valid inputs.
- The function assumes valid apartment numbers and does not check for negative or zero values. However, since the input guarantees valid ranges, this may not be a concern here.

### Output Hints Agreement

- The output hints describe the functionality of both functions accurately, indicating that `get_location` returns the correct block and floor for a given apartment number.
- The hints for `func_1` summarize the time calculations correctly, including the elevator wait time, walking time, and floor transition time.

### Conclusion

After careful consideration of the code, the problem description, and the output hints, it appears that the code correctly implements the required functionality. It calculates the time for Edward to reach Natasha accurately based on the given problem constraints.

Thus, I cannot identify any edge cases or scenarios where the code fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

**Explanation:** The program correctly computes the time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment by considering all necessary factors: elevator usage, walking time between entrances, and time to reach the target floor. The calculations align with the problem description and constraints provided.
