The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in its definition. However, it operates on the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`, ensuring that `a` and `b` are distinct values (i.e., `a ≠ b`). 

Since the output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and a and b are distinct integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). The output behavior is not specified.**
