Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote while adhering to the specified ratio of 1:2:4.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the compote using the formula:
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
   This ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available lemons, and that the number of apples and pears used is consistent with the required ratios.
3. It then computes the total number of fruits used in the compote:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`
   This correctly sums the number of lemons, apples, and pears based on the number of complete sets (`min_lemon`).

The program handles edge cases, such as when there are not enough fruits to make even one compote (for example, if any of `a`, `b`, or `c` is insufficient to meet the ratio requirements). In such cases, `min_lemon` will be zero, and the output will correctly be zero.

All provided examples in the problem description return the expected results, confirming the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements, and I conclude that it is correct.
