The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated based on the initial state. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The print statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since `total_fruits` is derived from `max_lemons`, which in turn depends on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state will reflect the values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and the function prints `total_fruits`.**
