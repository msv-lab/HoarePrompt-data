The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates on three positive integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value or the specific behavior based on the input parameters. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters based on the constraints given.

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers a, b, and c representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The return value is not specified.**
