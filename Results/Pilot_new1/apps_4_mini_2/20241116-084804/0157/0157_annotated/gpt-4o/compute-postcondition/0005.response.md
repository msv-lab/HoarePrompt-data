To determine the output state, we first need to evaluate the variables based on the initial state given:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.
- `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(total_fruits)
```

This line will print the value of `total_fruits`.

Since `total_fruits` is derived from `max_lemons`, and `max_lemons` in turn depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- The value of `total_fruits` is determined by the previously calculated `max_lemons`, which is based on the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- The output will be the printed value of `total_fruits`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `total_fruits` based on the calculations.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7, and the function prints total_fruits.**
