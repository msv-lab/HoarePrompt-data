The variable `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is unknown, but it is stated to be a positive integer, and it will be updated to the new input integer. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
