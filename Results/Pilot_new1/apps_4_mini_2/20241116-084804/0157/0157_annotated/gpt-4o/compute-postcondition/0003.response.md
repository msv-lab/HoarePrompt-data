The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and the exact values will determine the output. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_lemons` is calculated based on these inputs. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
