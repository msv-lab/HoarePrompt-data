To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code and how it aligns with the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears, and he wants to make a compote with a specific ratio:
- For every 1 lemon, he needs 2 apples and 4 pears.
The task is to compute the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in the compote based on these constraints.

### Code Analysis:
The function reads three integers from input, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
```python
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```
This line effectively finds the limiting factor among the available fruits:
- The number of lemons available (`a`)
- The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`)
- The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`)

Then, it calculates the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```
This simplifies to:
```python
total_fruits = max_lemons * 7
```
Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Insufficient Fruits**: If any of the fruits required for the compote are not sufficient (e.g., not enough pears), the function will correctly return `0` because `max_lemons` will be `0` in such cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Exact Ratios**: The function correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits, ensuring the ratios are maintained.
3. **Minimum Input Values**: The function handles the smallest values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (all being 1) correctly, resulting in `0` since there aren't enough fruits to meet the ratio.

### Evaluation of Annotations:
The annotations state that the function:
- Accepts three positive integers.
- Calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the available fruits.
- Prints the total number of fruits produced using those lemons.

The examples provided in the problem description align with the function's logic:
- For the input (2, 5, 7), it computes `1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears` resulting in `7`.
- For (4, 7, 13), it computes `3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears` resulting in `21`.
- For (2, 3, 2), it correctly identifies that not enough pears are available, returning `0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases. It handles edge cases appropriately and adheres to the specified ratios. The annotations support this conclusion by summarizing the function's behavior accurately.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
