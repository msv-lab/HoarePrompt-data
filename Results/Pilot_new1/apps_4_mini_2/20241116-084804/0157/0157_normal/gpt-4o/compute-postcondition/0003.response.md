The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum of three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, as well as the computed value of `max_lemons` based on these inputs.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
