The function accepts three integer inputs from the user (a, b, and c) and calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients that can be made based on the quantities provided. Specifically, it calculates the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, then computes the total as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which effectively totals to `min_lemon * 7`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
