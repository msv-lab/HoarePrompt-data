Postcondition: ***`digits` is the set of string representations of all integers contained in the lists within `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed; otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` contains at least `n` lists of integers. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set.***
