The code updates the `digits` set by adding string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` contains at least one list, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, the `digits` set will now contain the string representations of the integers in `cube`. The previous state of `digits` was an empty set, and it will now hold the string values of the integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
