The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all of its digits can be matched with available faces on a set of cubes represented by `cube_faces`. It returns `True` if all digits can be matched with distinct cube faces; otherwise, it returns `False`. If there are no cubes (i.e., if `n` is 0 or less), the function will not process any digits and will return `False`.
