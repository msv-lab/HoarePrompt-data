The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has now been marked as used. The previous state indicates that `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, so after execution, `used_cubes[i]` will be `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` values where `used_cubes[i]` is now `True`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` values where `used_cubes[i]` is now `True`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is False**.
