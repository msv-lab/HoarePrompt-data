Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where `used_cubes[i]` is now `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is set to True, indicating that the digit was found in the corresponding cube face. If the digit was not found in `cube_faces[i]` or if `used_cubes[i]` was already `True`, there are no changes to `used_cubes[i]` or `found`, and the program continues without breaking out of the loop.***
