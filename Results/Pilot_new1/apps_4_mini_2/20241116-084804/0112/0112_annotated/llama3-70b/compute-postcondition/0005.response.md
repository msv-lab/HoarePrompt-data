According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lists in `cubes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning `cubes` contains at least one list (the first list has been assigned to `cube`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2, and `cube` must be the second list in `cubes`. Therefore, `digits` should be updated with the string representations of the integers in the second list of `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with the string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
