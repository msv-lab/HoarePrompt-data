The code updates `digits` with the string representations of the integers in `cube`. Since `n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, the state of `cube` is determined by the contents of the third sublist. The `digits` variable will now contain the string representations of each integer in `cube`. The previous state of `digits` is not specified, but it will be updated with new string values. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated contents of `digits` based on the integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with the string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
