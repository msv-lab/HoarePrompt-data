The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lists of integers from the input, where each integer is between 0 and 9. It collects the unique string representations of these integers into a set called `digits`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. The function then constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and prints this integer. The function does not return any value.
