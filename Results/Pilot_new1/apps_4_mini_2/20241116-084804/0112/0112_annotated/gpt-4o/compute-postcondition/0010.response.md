According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, we adjust `n` to be greater than 1. The current value of `i` is 0, so we also need to set `i` to 1 for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, and `found` is a boolean.**
