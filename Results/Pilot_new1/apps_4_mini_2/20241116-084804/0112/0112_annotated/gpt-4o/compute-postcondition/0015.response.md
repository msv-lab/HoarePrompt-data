According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. This means that there is at least one more iteration possible since `i` can be incremented.

To prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to 2, and since `n` is still greater than 1, it remains unchanged. The `cube_faces` list will still contain `n` lists, and the `digits` list will still have at least one digit, but `digit` should now refer to the next digit in the `digits` list if applicable.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- Increment `i` to 2.
- The other states (`n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, and `digit`) remain unchanged, but we should ensure that `digit` is now the third digit in the `digits` list if `digits` has at least three elements.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, and `digit` is the third digit in the `digits` list (if available)**
