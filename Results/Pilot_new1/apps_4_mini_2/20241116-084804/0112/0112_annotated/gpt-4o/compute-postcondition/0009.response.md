Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, and `found` is a boolean. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes[i]` and `found` remain unchanged.***
