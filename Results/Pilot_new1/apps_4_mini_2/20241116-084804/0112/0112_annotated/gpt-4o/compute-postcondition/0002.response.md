According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. The loop will execute for each element in the `digits` list. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, the `cube_faces` list is defined, but it does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The key factor is that `digits` must contain at least 1 element for the loop to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration (if the loop executes), `digit` will be the last element in the `digits` list. For the loop to be executed, `digits` must have at least 1 digit. 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `digits` contains at least 1 element, and `digit` is initialized to the first digit in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list**
