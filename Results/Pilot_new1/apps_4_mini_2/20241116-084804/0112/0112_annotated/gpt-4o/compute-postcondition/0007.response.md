The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, and this change indicates that a condition has been met regarding the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces[i]`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `digit`, and `used_cubes`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, and `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, and `found` is True.**
