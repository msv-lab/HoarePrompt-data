According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more digit in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least one more digit, indicating that there are additional digits available for the loop to iterate over. 

Since `digit` is currently assigned the next digit in the `digits` list, for the loop to execute one more time, the `digit` must change to the next digit in the list, and the `digits` list must have at least one more digit available. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the `digit` is now the next digit and that the `digits` list has at least one more digit.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more digit, `n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `digit` is the next digit in the digits list, and `found` is assigned False**
