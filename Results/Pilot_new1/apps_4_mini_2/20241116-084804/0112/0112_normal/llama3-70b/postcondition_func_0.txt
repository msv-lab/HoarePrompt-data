The function accepts an integer input `n` (1 to 3), which indicates the number of subsequent lines to read. Each line contains 6 integers between 0 and 9. The function collects all unique digits from these lines into a set, removes '0' if it is present, and then constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. Finally, it prints this maximum number. If no digits are found (e.g., if all are '0's), the function will print an empty string.
