Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all digits found in the lists contained in `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 0 to 3 lists.***
