The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the input values to integers. The number of inner lists created is determined by the value of `n`, which can be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the output state reflects that `cubes` will contain either 1, 2, or 3 lists of integers based on user input. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers from input**
