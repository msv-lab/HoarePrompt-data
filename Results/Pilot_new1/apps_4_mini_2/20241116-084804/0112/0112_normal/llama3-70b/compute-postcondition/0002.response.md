The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `digits` is now an empty set, the output state reflects the current status of `digits`. The values of `n` and `cubes` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers; `digits` is an empty set**
