The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The value of `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Therefore, the length of the `used_cubes` list will be either 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `n`. Other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`**
