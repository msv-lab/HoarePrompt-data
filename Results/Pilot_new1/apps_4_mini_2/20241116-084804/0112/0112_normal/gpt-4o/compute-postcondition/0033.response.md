Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched to a set of cube faces (represented by `cube_faces`). It returns True if all digits can be matched, and False if any digit cannot be matched. If the input number has no digits (i.e., is 0), the function will still return True since the loop does not execute, effectively treating it as a valid case. Additionally, if `n` (the number of cube faces) is less than 1, the function will not perform any matching and will also return True, which may not be the intended behavior. **
