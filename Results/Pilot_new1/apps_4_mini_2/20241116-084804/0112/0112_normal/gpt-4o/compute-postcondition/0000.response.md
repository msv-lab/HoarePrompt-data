The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, but we know `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. The code converts `num` to a string and then creates a list of its digits. Since `num` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `digits`. The output state reflects that `digits` is a list of characters derived from the string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num`**
