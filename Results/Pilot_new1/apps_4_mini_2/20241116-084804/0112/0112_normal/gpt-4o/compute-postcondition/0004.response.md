According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, which means it will run `n` times as long as `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the loop will definitely execute since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

At the start of the first iteration, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0. The other variables, `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `found`, do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but we note their states for completeness. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:
- `i` is initialized to 0, as it starts from 0 in the range.
- `n` is as defined (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).
- `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`.
- `digits` is a list with at least 1 element.
- `found` remains False.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
