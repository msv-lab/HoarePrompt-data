Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False. If `found` is True, it indicates that `digit` was found in one of the `cube_faces` where the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` was initially False, and the respective `used_cubes[i]` is now set to True. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `used_cubes` as a list of `n` elements all set to False, and `found` remains False.***
