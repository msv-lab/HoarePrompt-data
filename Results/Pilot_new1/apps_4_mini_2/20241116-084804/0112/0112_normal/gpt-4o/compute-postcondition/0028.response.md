The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which is already its previous value. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state is: `found` is False, `digits` has at least two elements, and `digit` is the next element in the list.

Output State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least two elements, `digit` is the next element in the list**
