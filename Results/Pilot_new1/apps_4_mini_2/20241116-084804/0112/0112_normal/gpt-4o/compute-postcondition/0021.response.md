Output State: **If `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` and the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` is False, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop breaks after executing for that index. If `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]` or if `used_cubes[i]` is already True, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its previous value. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains a list of `n` elements all set to `False`, and `found` remains False.**
