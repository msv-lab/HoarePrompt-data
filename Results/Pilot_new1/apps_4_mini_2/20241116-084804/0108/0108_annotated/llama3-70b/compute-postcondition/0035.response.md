Output State: **`if 'b' is present in s, then res` is 'a' repeated according to the count of 'b' in the original s, `s` will eventually contain characters starting from the first character after 'b' in Unicode, and `char` will be the character that was being processed in the last iteration. If 'b' is not present in s initially, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain as 'a' repeated according to the count of 'b' in the original s, while `s` and `char` will remain unchanged.**
