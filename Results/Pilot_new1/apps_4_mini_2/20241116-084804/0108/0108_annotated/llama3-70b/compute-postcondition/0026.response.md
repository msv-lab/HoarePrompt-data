The value of `res` is incremented by `char`, which is 'c'. The previous value of `res` is not specified, but it will now include the character 'c' appended to it. The other variables, including `s` and `char`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `res`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include 'c', `s` contains characters starting from 'c', and `char` is 'c'**
