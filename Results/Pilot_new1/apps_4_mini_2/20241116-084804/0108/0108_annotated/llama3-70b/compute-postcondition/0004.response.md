The value of `res` is updated by appending `char`, which is 'a'. Since `res` is initially an empty string, after the execution, `res` will be 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
