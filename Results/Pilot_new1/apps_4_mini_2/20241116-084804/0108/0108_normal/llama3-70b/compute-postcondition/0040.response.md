Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing each character from `s` repeated for each occurrence, transformed into the next character in the alphabet until all characters in `s` are processed. The length of `res` is less than 26, indicating that not all characters of the alphabet are represented in `s`. The string `s` remains unchanged, and any characters in `s` that are not in the `alphabet` are not processed, leaving `res` unaffected by those characters.***
