The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. Given that `res` is initially 'a' and `char` is also 'a', the new value of `res` will be 'a' + 'a', which results in 'aa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
