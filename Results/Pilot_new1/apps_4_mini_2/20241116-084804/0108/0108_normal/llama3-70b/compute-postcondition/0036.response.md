According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `alphabet`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in the `alphabet` after the last character processed. Since the state mentions that `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character processed, we need to ensure that `char` reflects this. 

If `char` is not present in `s` at the beginning, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged. However, since we want to prepare for the next iteration, we need to set `char` to the next character in the `alphabet`, which would be the character following the last processed one. 

Thus, we need to adjust `char` to the next character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted since `s` and `res` are not directly affected until the loop executes.

State: **`if char is present in s then res` is a repeated string of 'a' for each occurrence of 'a' in `s` plus one 'c' for each occurrence of 'c' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'char' replaced with the next character in the alphabet until `char` is no longer in `s`; char is the next character in the alphabet after the last character processed.**
