The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, which calculates the length of the string `target`. The string `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which has a length of 26. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of the user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of the user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26**
