Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement of replacing characters to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". Specifically, it only checks if the characters of the input string can match the target subsequence without actually allowing for character replacements. 

For example, consider the input string "aabbccddeeffgg". In this case, the program would output "-1", even though it is possible to replace characters to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" (e.g., replacing the second 'a' with 'b', the second 'b' with 'c', and so on). 

Thus, the program fails to account for the ability to replace characters to achieve the desired subsequence, making it incorrect.
