Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of characters from the original `s` that were sequentially replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If the length of `res` is 26, the function prints `res`. If the length of `res` is less than 26, then either `s` contains characters beyond 'z', remains unchanged, or contains lowercase letters that were not all processed; if `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` is an empty string, and the function prints -1.***
