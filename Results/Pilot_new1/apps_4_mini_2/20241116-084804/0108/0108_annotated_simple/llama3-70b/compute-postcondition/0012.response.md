According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'c', and `char` is 'b'. Since `char` ('b') is not in `s` ('c'), the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` needs to include 'b'. 

State: **`s` is 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
