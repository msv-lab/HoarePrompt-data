The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char`, which is 'b'. The previous value of `res` is 'ab', so after executing the code, `res` becomes 'abb'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` contains 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
