The code snippet updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `ord(char) + 1`, and `s` is modified accordingly. However, `res` is updated to include `char`, and `s` remains unchanged as per the initial state condition. 

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `char`, and `s` is modified to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the next character.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, and `s` is modified to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the next character**.
