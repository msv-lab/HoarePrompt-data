The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values based on the input provided. The input function accepts a string of space-separated integers, which are then converted to integers by the `map(int, input().split())` function. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are replaced with the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers from the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on input values**
