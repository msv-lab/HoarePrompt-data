The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print function does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is 0, `a` is equal to `b`, and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is 0, `a` is equal to `b`, and the function prints 'YES'**
