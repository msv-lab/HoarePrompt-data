Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative result of `(b - a) / c`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `c` is not equal to 0 and either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output is 'NO'.***
