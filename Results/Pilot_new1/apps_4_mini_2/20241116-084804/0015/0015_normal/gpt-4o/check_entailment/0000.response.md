To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the output hints carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if a favorite integer `b` appears in a sequence defined by the first element `a` and a constant difference `c`. The sequence can be expressed as:
- \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \times c \)
We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Code Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Check if `b` equals `a`:**
   - If `b` is equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "YES".
  
2. **Check if `c` is zero:**
   - If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "NO" since the sequence remains constant at `a`.

3. **Check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative:**
   - The condition `(b - a) % c == 0` checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` repeatedly.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., not moving backwards if `c` is positive or not going forwards if `c` is negative).

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case where `c` is negative:**
   - If `c` is negative, `(b - a) / c` would be negative if `b > a`, which is handled correctly by the current conditions.

2. **Case where `c` is positive:**
   - The conditions correctly check if `b` can be reached from `a` by adding positive increments.

3. **Case where `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive:**
   - The program correctly identifies that `b` cannot be reached from `a` if `c` is positive.

4. **Case where `b` is less than `a` and `c` is negative:**
   - The program correctly identifies that `b` can be reached if the conditions `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` are satisfied.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the behavior of the code accurately. They explain the checks being performed and the logic behind returning "YES" or "NO". There is no discrepancy between the hints and the code logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c` for all potential cases outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem requirements.
