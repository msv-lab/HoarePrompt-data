To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The sequence is defined such that:
   - First element is `a` (i.e., `s_1 = a`).
   - The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c` (i.e., `s_{i} - s_{i-1} = c`).
   - The sequence can be represented as: `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c`.

2. We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Key Cases to Consider:
- If `b` is equal to `a`, then the answer should be "YES".
- If `c` is zero, the sequence does not change and remains constant at `a`. Therefore:
  - If `b` is equal to `a`, print "YES".
  - If `b` is not equal to `a`, print "NO".
- If `c` is not zero, we need to check if `(b - a) % c == 0` and if `(b - a) / c >= 0`.

### Analyzing the Provided Program:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Issues in the Code:
1. The condition `elif c == 0: print('NO')` is incorrect. If `c` is zero, we should only return "NO" if `b` is not equal to `a`. If `b` is equal to `a`, it should return "YES".
  
### Example of Failure:
- Input: `10 10 0`
  - Expected Output: "YES" (since `b` equals `a`)
  - Actual Output: "NO" (due to the faulty condition)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `c` is zero correctly. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
