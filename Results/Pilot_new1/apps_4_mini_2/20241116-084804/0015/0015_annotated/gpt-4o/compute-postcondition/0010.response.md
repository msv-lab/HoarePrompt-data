The code prints 'NO', which does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the values of the variables. The print statement indicates a specific output but does not alter the state of the variables. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user. The value of `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) is not divisible by c or (b - a) / c is negative. The output is 'NO'.**
