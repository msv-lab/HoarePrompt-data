The code assigns a new value to `total_sum`, calculated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `total_sum = (0 + num) % MOD`, which is equivalent to `total_sum = num % MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and there is no information given about `num` or `MOD`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the updated `total_sum`.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is incremented by 1, `total_sum` is `num % MOD`**
