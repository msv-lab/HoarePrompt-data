The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, after executing the line, `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `num` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is l % MOD, `num` is l, and the result of func_1(num, k) is true.**
