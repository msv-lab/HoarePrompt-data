To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the operation on the variable `dp[n, k]`.

1. The initial values are:
   - `dp[n, k]` is -720
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is greater than 2 (we'll denote it as `k` for calculation)

2. The expression being executed is:
   ```
   dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
   ```

3. Breaking down the expression:
   - `i - 1` is `2 - 1`, which equals `1`.
   - Therefore, `10 ** (i - 1)` is `10 ** 1`, which is `10`.
   - Now, we need to evaluate `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)`. 
     - Since `k` is greater than 2, `k - i` will be at least `k - 2`, which is at least `1`.
     - Thus, `10 ** (k - i)` will be `10` raised to a power greater than or equal to `1`, resulting in a value of at least `10`.
     - The term `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` will therefore be at least `10 - 10`, which equals `0` when `k = 3`.

4. The entire expression simplifies to:
   ```
   dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - i) - 10)
   ```
   Since `10 ** (k - i)` is greater than or equal to `10`, the term `(10 ** (k - i) - 10)` will be positive for `k > 3`.

5. Therefore, the value of `dp[n, k]` will be updated as follows:
   - If `k = 3`, then the term becomes `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * 0`, which does not change `dp[n, k]`.
   - For `k > 3`, `dp[n, k]` will be updated to a value greater than -720.

6. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the final value of `dp[n, k]` but we can state that it will be greater than -720 if `k > 3`.

Thus, the output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated from -720 to a value greater than -720; `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 2**.
