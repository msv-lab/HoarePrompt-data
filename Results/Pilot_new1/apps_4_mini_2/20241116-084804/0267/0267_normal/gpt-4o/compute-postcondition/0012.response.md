Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false for all values in the range, `total_sum` will also remain 0.**
