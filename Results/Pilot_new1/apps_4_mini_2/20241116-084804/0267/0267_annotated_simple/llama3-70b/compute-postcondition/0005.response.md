Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10, the function checks if the tuple (n, k) exists in the data structure `dp`. If it does, it returns the associated value from `dp`. If the tuple does not exist, there is no return value from the function.***
