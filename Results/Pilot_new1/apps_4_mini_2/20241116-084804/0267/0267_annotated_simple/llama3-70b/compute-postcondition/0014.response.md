According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently less than `k` (since it is within the range from 1 to k-1). 

Since `k` is greater than 2, the maximum value of `i` in the last iteration would have been `k-2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `k-1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `l`, `r`, `n`, and `dp[n, k]` do not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated from 9 * 10 by adding 9 * 10, `i` is `k-1`**
