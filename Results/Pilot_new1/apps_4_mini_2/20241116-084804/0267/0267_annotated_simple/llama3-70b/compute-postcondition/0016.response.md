According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k` since `k` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be `i = 2` at the start of the next iteration (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `k-1`). 

Since `k` is greater than 2, and `i` is currently less than `k`, we can conclude that the loop can execute again. However, we need to ensure that the state reflects the next iteration of `i`.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 * 10 + 9 * 10, i is 2`**
