The value of `dp[n, k]` is 180, and it is modified by the operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD`. However, the value of `MOD` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the new value of `dp[n, k]` after the modulus operation. The output state reflects that the variable `dp[n, k]` is affected, but its final value cannot be specified without knowing `MOD`. 

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is 180 and is modified by the operation `dp[n, k] %= MOD`, but the final value cannot be determined without `MOD`.**
