The provided Python program aims to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. Let's analyze the code and the problem description to determine its correctness.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`. It does this by converting `n` to a string, creating a set of its characters (digits), and checking the length of that set.
   - This logic is correct and adheres to the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function initializes `total_sum` to 0 and iterates through each number from `l` to `r` (inclusive).
   - For each number, it calls `func_1(num, k)` to check if the number has at most `k` different digits. If it does, it adds the number to `total_sum` modulo `998244353`.
   - The loop correctly accumulates the sum of the numbers that meet the criteria.

### Potential Issues

1. **Performance**: 
   - The algorithm uses a simple loop over the range from `l` to `r`. Given the constraints where `r` can be as large as `10^18`, this could lead to performance issues, as iterating through such a large range is impractical. The program will not terminate in a reasonable time for large inputs.

2. **Handling Large Ranges**:
   - For example, if we consider `l = 1` and `r = 10^18`, the program would attempt to iterate over an impossibly large range, which is not feasible.

3. **Missing Modulo Declaration**:
   - The variable `MOD` is referenced but not defined in the provided code. This will lead to a `NameError` when the code is executed.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle cases where `l` and `r` are very large, leading to performance issues. Additionally, the undefined `MOD` variable would cause runtime errors. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, especially for large inputs.

Correctness: **False**
