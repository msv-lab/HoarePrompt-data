The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since `total_sum` is initially 0, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + num) % MOD`, which simplifies to `num % MOD`. The value of `num` is `l`, and `l` is less than or equal to `r`, but we do not know the specific value of `l`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `total_sum` and the existing values of `num` and `l`.

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
