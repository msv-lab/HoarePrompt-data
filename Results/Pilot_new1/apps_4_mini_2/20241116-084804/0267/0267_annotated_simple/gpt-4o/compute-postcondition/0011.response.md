According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0 initially. If `func_1(num, k)` returned True during the last iteration, then `total_sum` would have been updated to `l % MOD`. However, since `total_sum` is still 0, it indicates that `func_1(num, k)` returned False, meaning no update occurred.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to check the current value of `num`. Since the loop starts at `l` and goes up to `r + 1`, if the last value of `num` was `r`, then `num` needs to be incremented to `r + 1` for the loop to execute again. However, since `num` can only take values up to `r`, the loop will not execute again if `num` has reached `r + 1`.

Thus, in order for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `num` is less than `r + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `num` is set to `l` for the loop to start again.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, l is less than or equal to r, num is l**
