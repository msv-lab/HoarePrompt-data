The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, after executing the code, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `num` is `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
