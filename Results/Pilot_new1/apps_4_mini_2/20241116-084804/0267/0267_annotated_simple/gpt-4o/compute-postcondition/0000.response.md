The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation, and their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables involved.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0**.
