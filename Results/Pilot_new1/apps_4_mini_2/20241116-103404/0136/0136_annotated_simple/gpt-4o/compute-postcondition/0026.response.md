The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, and may have leading zeroes. The function performs operations on these string representations of integers and returns a result based on the input values. However, the specific output or behavior of the function based on the values of `a` and `b` is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings.**
