Postcondition: ***If `len(a)` is less than `len(b)`, '<' is printed. If `len(a)` is greater than `len(b)`, '>' is printed. If `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, the output is determined by comparing `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed; if `a` is equal to `b`, '=' is printed. In all cases, `a` is either '0' (if it was originally empty) or retains its original value, `b` remains the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `data` remains unchanged.***
