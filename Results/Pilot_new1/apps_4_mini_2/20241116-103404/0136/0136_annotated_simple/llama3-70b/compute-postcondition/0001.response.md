The value of `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes in the input string will be removed. The initial state indicates that `a` is an input string with leading zeroes already removed, and `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. The state of `a` remains unchanged, but `b` will now reflect the new input without leading zeroes. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is the input string without leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is the input string without leading zeroes**
