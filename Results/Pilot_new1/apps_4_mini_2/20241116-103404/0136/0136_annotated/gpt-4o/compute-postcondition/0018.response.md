Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. The length of string `a` is less than or equal to the length of string `b`. Both strings retain their values without leading zeros, and `a` is greater than `b`. If `b` is empty, it is '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is '0'. If `b` was originally a non-empty string, it remains unchanged. Additionally, `a` is strictly greater than `b`.***
