Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. The first string `a` is unchanged or is '0' if it was originally empty, and has no leading zeros. The second string `b` is either '0' if it was originally empty or remains unchanged without leading zeros. The length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.***
