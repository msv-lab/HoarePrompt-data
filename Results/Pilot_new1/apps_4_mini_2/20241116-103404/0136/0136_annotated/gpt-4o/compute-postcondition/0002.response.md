The code assigns to `b` the value of `data[1]` with any leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers, and `a` is the string of the first integer without leading zeros. The value of `b` remains unchanged before this operation.

Since `data[1]` is a string representing a non-negative integer, removing leading zeros from it may result in an empty string if `data[1]` consists solely of zeros. The output state will reflect the change in `b`, while `data` and `a` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers; `a` is the string of the first integer without leading zeros; `b` is the string of the second integer without leading zeros**
