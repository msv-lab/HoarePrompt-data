Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. The length of string `a` is less than or equal to the length of string `b`. `b` is a non-empty string that remains unchanged without leading zeros. The string `a` is a non-empty string that is less than `b`, and both strings retain their values without leading zeros. If `a` was originally empty, it is set to '0'.***
