Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. The length of string `a` is greater than the length of string `b`. String `b` is either '0' if it was originally empty, or it remains unchanged without leading zeros if it was non-empty. String `a` remains unchanged or is set to '0' if it was originally empty, and retains its value without leading zeros.***
