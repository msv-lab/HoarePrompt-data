Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, and `b` is the input string after leading zeroes have been removed. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'. This covers all cases where `a` and `b` are compared lexicographically, ensuring that the strings are properly evaluated without leading zeroes affecting their comparison.***
