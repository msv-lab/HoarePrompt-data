The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `'>'`. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros and remaining unchanged if it was not empty; `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and if `b` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` is not equal to `a`, and the output is `'>'`.

Output State: **`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros and remaining unchanged if it was not empty; `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and if `b` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` is not equal to `a`, and the output is '>'**
