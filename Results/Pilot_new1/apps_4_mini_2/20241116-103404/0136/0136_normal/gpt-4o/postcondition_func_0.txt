The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, potentially containing leading zeros. It compares these two numbers and prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either number is initially empty (after removing leading zeros), it is treated as '0'. The function handles edge cases where the strings have different lengths or where one or both numbers are zero.
