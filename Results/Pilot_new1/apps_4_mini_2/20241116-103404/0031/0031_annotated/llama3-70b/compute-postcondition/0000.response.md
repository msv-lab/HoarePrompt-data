The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which means `total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`. The value of `n` is within the range of 1 to 10^18, so `total_days` will be a very large integer depending on the specific value of `n`. Other variables (`k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `total_days` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
