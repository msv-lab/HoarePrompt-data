The value of `numerator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`. Since `numerator` is 1 and `gcd` is also 1, the result of `numerator //= gcd` will be 1 // 1, which equals 1. The values of `denominator`, `total_days`, and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `total_days` is 2^n, `gcd` is 1.

Output State: **`numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `total_days` is 2^n, `gcd` is 1**
