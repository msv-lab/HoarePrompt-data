The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `n`. Since the initial conditions state that `k` is less than or equal to `2` raised to the power of `n`, the program does not execute any further operations. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**.
