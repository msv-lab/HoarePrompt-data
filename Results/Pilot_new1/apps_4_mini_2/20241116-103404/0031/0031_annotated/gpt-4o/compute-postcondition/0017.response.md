According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 3 (so that `i` can increment to 3), and `i` must be updated to 3.

State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^n - 2) % 1000003`, `denominator` is \(2^{3n} \mod 1000003\), `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 2**
