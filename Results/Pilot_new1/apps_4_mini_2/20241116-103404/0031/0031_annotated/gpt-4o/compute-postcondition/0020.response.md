The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The previous value of `denominator` is not specified, but it is calculated as `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`. The values of `numerator` and `p_no_shared` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.
