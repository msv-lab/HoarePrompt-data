The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The initial state mentions that `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, but it does not directly affect the assignment of `p_total`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `p_total` takes the value of `denominator`, while `p_no_shared` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**
