The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The previous value of `p_total` was assigned the value of `denominator`, so `B` will now hold that same value. The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_shared`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `denominator`.**
