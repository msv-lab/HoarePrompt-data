The code assigns the value `10 ** 6 + 3` to the variable `MOD`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the newly assigned value of `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**
