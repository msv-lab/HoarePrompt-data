To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
The problem requires us to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people have the same birthday when there are `2^n` days in a year. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b`. The logic here is correct and will be used later to ensure that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The first check `if (k > 1 << n)` is to see if the number of people `k` exceeds the number of days `2^n`. If it does, it immediately concludes that at least two people must share a birthday, returning \( (1, 1) \). This is correct.
   - The loop computes the probability of no shared birthdays by calculating the numerator and denominator of the probability fraction. This part is also logically sound, as it iterates over the number of people and adjusts the numerator and denominator accordingly.
   - After calculating the probability, it uses `func_1` to get the GCD and reduces \( A \) and \( B \) accordingly.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **When `n = 1` and `k = 2`**:
   - There are `2^1 = 2` days. Since `k = 2`, the probability of both people having the same birthday is \( \frac{1}{2} \). The program should output \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), but it will output \( A = 1, B = 1 \) because it checks `k > 2^n` and returns \( (1, 1) \) without calculating the actual probability.

2. **When `n = 1` and `k = 3`**:
   - There are only 2 days, and with 3 people, it guarantees that at least two will share a birthday. The program correctly outputs \( (1, 1) \) for this case.

3. **When `n = 2` and `k = 3`**:
   - There are `2^2 = 4` days. The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday should be calculated, and the program should output the correct irreducible fraction. The actual calculation is performed correctly.

### Conclusion
The program fails in the case where `n = 1` and `k = 2`, as it returns \( (1, 1) \) instead of \( (1, 2) \) due to the early exit condition. Thus, it does not handle all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
