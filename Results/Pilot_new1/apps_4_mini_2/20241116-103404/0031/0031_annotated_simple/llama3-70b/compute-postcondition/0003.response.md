According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. The states provided indicate that `n` is an integer within the specified range, which does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but it does determine the value of `total_days`. 

Since `numerator` and `denominator` are both initialized to 1, they will not affect the loop execution either. The variable `i` will start at 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. The initial values of `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not need to change for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
