Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1` modulo `MOD`; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k` modulo `MOD`; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B); A` is updated to `A // g`; `B` is updated to `B // g`.**
