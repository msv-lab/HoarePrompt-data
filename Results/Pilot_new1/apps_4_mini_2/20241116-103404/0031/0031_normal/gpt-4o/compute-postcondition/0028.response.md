The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the function does not print anything and continues execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and check the relationship between `k` and `2^n`, printing (1, 1) if `k` exceeds `2^n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it does not print anything and continues execution.**
