The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), the value of `total_days` will be a very large integer, specifically \(2^n\). The variable `k` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
