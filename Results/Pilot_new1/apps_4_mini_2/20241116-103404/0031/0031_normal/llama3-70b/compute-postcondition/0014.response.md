Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, where `numerator` is the product of `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, and `denominator` is `2` raised to the power of `n * k`. If `k` is greater than `total_days`, `numerator` will include negative values. If `k` is less than or equal to `total_days`, `numerator` will be non-negative.**
