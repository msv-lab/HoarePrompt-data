To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze it step by step in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If it is not possible to create such a sequence, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis
1. The first check `if n < k:` correctly identifies that if `n` is less than `k`, it's impossible to create a sequence of `k` positive integers, and thus it should return -1.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, k + 1):` is designed to create a sequence starting from 1 up to `k`. It attempts to append each integer `i` to the sequence and subtracts `i` from `n`.
3. After the loop, if the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it returns -1, indicating that it couldn't construct the required sequence.

### Edge Cases
- When `n` is exactly equal to the sum of the first `k` integers, which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. For instance, if `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` works because `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- When `k` is very large compared to `n`, it should return -1.
- When `n` is large and `k` is small, it should still be able to construct the sequence if the conditions are met.

### Potential Issue
The program does not handle the case where the sequence can be formed but the GCD is not maximized. Specifically, if we take `n` and `k`, the program only constructs the sequence by taking the first `k` integers. This does not guarantee that the GCD will be maximized.

For example:
- Let's consider `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The program will output `1 2 3` (which sums to 6), but we could also have `2, 4, 6` which sums to 12 and has a GCD of 2, which is greater than the GCD of the previous sequence (1).

### Conclusion
The program does not maximize the GCD of the sequence. Therefore, it is possible to have valid sequences that are not returned by the program. 

Correctness: **False**
