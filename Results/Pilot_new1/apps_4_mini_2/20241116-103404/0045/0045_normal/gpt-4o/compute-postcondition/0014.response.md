The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
