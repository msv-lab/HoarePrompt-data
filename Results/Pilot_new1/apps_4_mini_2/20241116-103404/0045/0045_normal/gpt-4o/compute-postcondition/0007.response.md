According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `k - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1` since the range function requires the start value to be greater than or equal to the stop value (which is `-1` in this case). Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, we can conclude that `k` is at least `1`. 

At the start of the loop:
- `i` will take on the value of `k - 1` in the first iteration. 
- The loop will continue until `i` reaches `0`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `1` and that `i` is initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: [d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k], `i` is `k - 1`**
