The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is greater than `b`, the value of `a % b` will be a positive integer less than `b`. 

Let's break it down:
- `a` is initially greater than `b`.
- After the execution:
  - `a` takes the value of `b`.
  - `b` takes the value of `a % b`, which is a positive integer less than `b`.

The specific values of `n` and `k` do not affect the operation of this code, and since `a` and `b` are not defined in terms of specific values other than `a > b`, we can only describe their relationship after the operation.

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, where `a` is greater than `b`**
