The code assigns the values of `b` and `a % b` to `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `a` is greater than `b` and `b` is greater than 0, `a % b` will yield a value that is less than `b`. Therefore, after the execution, `a` will have the value of `b`, and `b` will have the value of `a % b`. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b` (where `a` is greater than `b` and `b` is greater than 0)**
