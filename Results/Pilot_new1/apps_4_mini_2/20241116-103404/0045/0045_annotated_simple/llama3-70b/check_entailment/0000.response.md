The provided Python program is incomplete and does not address the problem description adequately. The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers but does not implement the logic required to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` with the maximum GCD.

Here are the key points regarding the problem description and the provided code:

1. **Input Requirements**: The program needs to handle two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the sum of the sequence and the number of elements in the sequence, respectively.

2. **Output Requirements**: The program should output a sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have the maximum GCD, or -1 if no such sequence exists.

3. **Missing Logic**: The program does not contain any logic to generate the sequence of numbers based on `n` and `k`. It only includes a function to calculate GCD, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

4. **Edge Cases**: For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the program should return -1 because it is impossible to create a strictly increasing sequence of three positive integers that sum to 5.

Since the program does not address the requirements of the problem description and lacks the necessary logic to produce the correct output, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
