To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The for loop is defined as `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it will iterate starting from `k - 1` down to `0`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `i` is currently at a value that has been increased by 1 (i.e., `sequence[i]` has been incremented). Therefore, we need to determine what the value of `i` was at the start of the last iteration. 

3. Given that the loop decrements `i` on each iteration, if `i` was `0` at the end of the last iteration, the loop would not execute again. However, if `i` was greater than `0`, it would execute again, decrementing `i` by 1.

4. The state indicates that `k` is at least `1`, which means `k - 1` is at least `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be decremented to `-1`, which means `i` must have been `0` at the end of the last iteration.

5. Since `i` is `0` at the end of the last iteration, the loop will not execute again unless `k` is adjusted to allow `i` to start from `1` or higher. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is increased to at least `2`, which allows `i` to start from `1` on the next iteration.

6. No other states need to be adjusted, as the rest of the variables (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence[i]`) do not affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the adjusted state will be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
