Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is `k - 2`). If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is not 0, the execution continues without breaking.***
