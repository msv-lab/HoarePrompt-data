Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues executing the next iteration of the loop or the subsequent statements in the program.***
