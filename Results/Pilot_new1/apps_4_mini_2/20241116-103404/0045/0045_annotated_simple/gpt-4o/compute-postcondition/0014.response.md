The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is now `k - 2`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
