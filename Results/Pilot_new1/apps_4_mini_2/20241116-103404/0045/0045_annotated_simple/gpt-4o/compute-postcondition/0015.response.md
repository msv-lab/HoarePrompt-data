Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is now `k - 2`). If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating the end of the current iteration, while maintaining the state of all other variables as described.***
