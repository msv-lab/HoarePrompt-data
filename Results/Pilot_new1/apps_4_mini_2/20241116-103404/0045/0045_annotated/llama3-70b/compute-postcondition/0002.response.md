The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is greater than `b`, the value of `a % b` will be less than `b` and greater than or equal to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is greater than `b` (let's denote `a` as `x` and `b` as `y` for clarity, where `x > y`).

After the execution:
- `b` will take the value of `y`, and `a` will take the value of `x % y`, which is a positive integer less than `y`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` after the operation.

Output State: **`a` is now `a % b`, `b` is now the previous value of `a`, and `a` is greater than `b`**
