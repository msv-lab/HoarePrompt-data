Output State: **If `b` is greater than 0, the loop will execute until `b` becomes 0. At the end of the loop, `a` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `n` and `k`, and `b` will be 0. If `b` is 0 at the start, the loop will not execute, and `a` will retain its initial value.**
