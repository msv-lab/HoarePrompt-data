The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the minimum required sum, defined as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum exceeds the available sum. If the minimum required sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value.

In Case 2, the function returns an updated sequence based on the value of a variable named `remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 0, the sequence reflects incremented values; if `remainder` is 0, the sequence remains unchanged; and if `remainder` is negative, the sequence has been incremented beyond its initial value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers, `n` and `k`, and to return either -1 if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`, or an updated sequence based on the value of `remainder` in other cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`. Otherwise, it returns an updated sequence based on the value of `remainder`.**
