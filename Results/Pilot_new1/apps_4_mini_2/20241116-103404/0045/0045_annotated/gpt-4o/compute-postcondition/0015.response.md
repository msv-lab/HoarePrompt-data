Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is equal to `k - 2`. If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that a condition for termination has been met; otherwise, the program continues executing the loop or subsequent statements.***
