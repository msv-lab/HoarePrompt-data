The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is updated at index `k - 2`, and `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
