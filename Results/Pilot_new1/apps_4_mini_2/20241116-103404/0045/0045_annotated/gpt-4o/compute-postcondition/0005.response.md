The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`. Therefore, the value of `remainder` depends on these calculations. 

Since `d` is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`, we can express `d * min_sum` as the largest multiple of `min_sum` that is less than or equal to `n`. Thus, `remainder` represents the leftover part when `n` is divided by `min_sum`.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder`. Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `k`, we will represent these values symbolically.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`**
