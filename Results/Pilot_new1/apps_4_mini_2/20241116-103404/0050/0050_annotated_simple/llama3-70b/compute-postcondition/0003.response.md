The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The output state will reflect the sorted state of the list `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers based on user input**
