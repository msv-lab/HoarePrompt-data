Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is at least `s[0]` (if `shares` was initially greater than 0, then `r` is at least `s[0] + shares * b[i]`), `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `s` is a sorted list. If `shares` was not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
