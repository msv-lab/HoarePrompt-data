Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, and `shares` is updated based on the division of `r` by `s[i]`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0 and `r` still as the input integer.***
