The variable `b` is assigned a new list created by mapping the `int` function over the results of `input().split()`. This means that `b` will contain a list of integers based on the input provided by the user. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers from user input; `b` is a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list of integers based on user input**
