The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum buying price from the list `s` and the maximum selling price from the list `b`. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial amount `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` at the minimum buying price and computes the total amount of bourles obtained by selling those shares at the maximum selling price, adding any remaining bourles from the initial amount. Finally, it prints the total bourles. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` or `m` is 0, which could lead to errors when trying to calculate `min_buy_price` or `max_sell_price` if the lists `s` or `b` are empty.
