The list `b` is sorted in reverse order, which means its values will be arranged from highest to lowest. The initial state indicates that `b` holds a list of integers from the input, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `b` has been sorted in reverse order, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `b` is sorted in reverse order**
