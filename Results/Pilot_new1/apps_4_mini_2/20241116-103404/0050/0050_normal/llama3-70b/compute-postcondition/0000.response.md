The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are integers within the range of 1 to 30, and `r` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are replaced by the values obtained from the `input().split()` function, which will be converted to integers. Other variables (`s` and `b`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `r`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000**
