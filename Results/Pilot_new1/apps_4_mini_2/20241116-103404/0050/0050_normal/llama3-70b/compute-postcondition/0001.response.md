The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into parts. The input is expected to be a space-separated string of integers, and since `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this line, their values remain unchanged. However, the exact contents of `s` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from the input.**
