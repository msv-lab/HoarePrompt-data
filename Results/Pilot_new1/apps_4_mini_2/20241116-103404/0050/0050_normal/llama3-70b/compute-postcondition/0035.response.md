The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
