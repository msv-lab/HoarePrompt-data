Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from input in descending order, and `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop or statement is exited without any changes to `shares` or `r`. This ensures that the logic correctly handles cases where `r` is either sufficient to allocate shares or not, while maintaining the integrity of the variables involved.***
