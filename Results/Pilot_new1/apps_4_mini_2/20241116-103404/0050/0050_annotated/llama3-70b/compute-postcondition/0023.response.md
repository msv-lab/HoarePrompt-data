According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to 3. Since `n` is greater than 1, it is possible for `n` to be at least 3 or greater, allowing for the next iteration.

Therefore, the necessary states to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions for `n` (being greater than 1) already allow for further iterations.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from input in descending order, `i` is 3**
