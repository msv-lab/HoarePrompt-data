The function `func` has no parameters explicitly defined in the signature. However, it operates under certain constraints for its inputs. The function is designed to work with the following:

- `n` and `m` are integers where the range is constrained to 1 <= n, m <= 30.
- `r` is an integer constrained such that 1 <= r <= 1000.
- `s` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `s_i` satisfies the constraint 1 <= s_i <= 1000.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers, where each integer `b_i` also satisfies the constraint 1 <= b_i <= 1000.

The function's output is not specified directly in the provided information. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality based on the constraints and relationships of the parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates on integers n and m, an integer r, a list s of n integers, and a list b of m integers, all within specified constraints.**
