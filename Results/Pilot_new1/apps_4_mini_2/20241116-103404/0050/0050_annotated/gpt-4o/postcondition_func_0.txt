The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from user input, along with two lists of integers `s` (buy prices) and `b` (sell prices). It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining amount after buying those shares, and then calculates the total value of shares sold at the maximum sell price plus any remaining amount. It prints this total value. The function does not handle cases where the lists `s` or `b` might be empty, which could lead to a ValueError when calculating `min_buy_price` or `max_sell_price`.
