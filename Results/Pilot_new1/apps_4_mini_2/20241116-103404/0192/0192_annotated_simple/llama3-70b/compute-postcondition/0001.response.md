The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the conditions that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but they are constrained by the given inequalities.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on user input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(`x - y`)**
