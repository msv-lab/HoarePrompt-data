The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input received from the user, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the input string into two integers. The previous values of `x` and `y` are overwritten, but since the new values are not specified, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now integers based on the user's input while maintaining the condition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on user input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
