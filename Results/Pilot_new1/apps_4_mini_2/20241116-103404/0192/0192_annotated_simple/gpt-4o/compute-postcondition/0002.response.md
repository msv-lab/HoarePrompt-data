The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it is implied that it operates on two integer variables, `x` and `y`, which satisfy the constraints: 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Based on these constraints, the function will perform operations using these integers. 

Since there is no output provided for the function, we cannot determine the specific return values or behavior based on the given information. Therefore, we can only state the accepted parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on two integers, x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value or behavior is not defined in the provided information.**
