The values of `x` and `y` are assigned through the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes a space-separated input, splits it, and converts each part to an integer. The initial state specifies that `y` is an integer such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided. Therefore, we know that `x` and `y` will be updated to new integer values based on the input. 

The output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now assigned new integer values based on user input, while still adhering to the initial conditions. 

Output State: **`x` is a new integer value, `y` is a new integer value such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
