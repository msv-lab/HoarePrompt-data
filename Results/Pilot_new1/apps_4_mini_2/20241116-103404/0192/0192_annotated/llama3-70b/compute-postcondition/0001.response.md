The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is an input integer greater than `y` and less than or equal to 100,000, and `y` is an input integer such that `3 ≤ y < x`, the value of `abs(x - y)` will be equal to `x - y`, since `x` is greater than `y`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer greater than `y` and less than or equal to 100,000; `y` is an input integer such that `3 ≤ y < x`; the printed value is `x - y`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than `y` and less than or equal to 100,000; `y` is an input integer such that `3 ≤ y < x`; the printed value is `x - y`**
