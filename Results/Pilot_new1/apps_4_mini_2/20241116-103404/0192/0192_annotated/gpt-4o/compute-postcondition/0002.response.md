The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Without further information on what the function does or returns based on `x` and `y`, we cannot accurately describe its functionality. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently indeterminate due to lack of information regarding its output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, and its return value is unspecified.**
