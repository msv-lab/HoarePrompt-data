The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of integers between `y` and `x` inclusive. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we compute the difference `x - y`, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer. The first term `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of complete pairs of integers between `y` and `x`, while the second term `(x - y) % 2` adds 1 if there is an unpaired integer left (i.e., if the difference is odd).

Let's denote `d = x - y`. Then the output of the print statement is `d // 2 + d % 2`, which simplifies to `(d + 1) // 2`. 

Thus, the output state will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`, but we can say that `d` is a positive integer. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the result of the print statement is (x - y + 1) // 2**
