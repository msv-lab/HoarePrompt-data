The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the input, where `input` accepts two integers separated by a space. The condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which means that the values of `x` and `y` must satisfy this condition after the input is processed. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now specific integers that comply with the given constraints.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `y` and less than or equal to 100,000; `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than `x`.**
