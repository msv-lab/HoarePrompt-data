Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs `x` and `y` from the user, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. It does not return a value, and it is assumed that `y` is always less than `x` and both are within the range of 3 to 100,000 based on the conditions mentioned. However, the function does not handle any input validation or error checking for cases where the input might not meet these constraints. **
