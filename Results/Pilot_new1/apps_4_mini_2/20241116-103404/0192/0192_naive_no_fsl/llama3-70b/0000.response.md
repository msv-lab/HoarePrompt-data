Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)`, which does not account for the operations needed to maintain a non-degenerate triangle. 

For example, consider the input `6 3`. The program outputs `3`, which is incorrect. The correct process involves transitioning through multiple states as described in the problem statement, and the minimum number of seconds required is `4`, not `3`. 

Thus, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y` while ensuring that it remains a non-degenerate triangle throughout the process.
