Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative count of '0's minus the cumulative count of '1's from the string `s` up to index `i-1`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros; `balance`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged.**
