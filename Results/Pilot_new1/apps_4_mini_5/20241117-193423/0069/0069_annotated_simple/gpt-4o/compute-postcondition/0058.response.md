Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative count of '0's minus the cumulative count of '1's from the string `s` up to index `i-1`. `balance` is equal to 0, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. The value `x` is present in the `prefix_balances` list.***
