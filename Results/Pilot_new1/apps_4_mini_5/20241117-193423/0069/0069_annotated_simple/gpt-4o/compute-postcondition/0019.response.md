The loop calculates the prefix balances based on the string `s`, where it increments the balance for each '0' and decrements it for each '1'. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` will contain the prefix sums calculated from `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance up to index `i - 1`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times; otherwise, if `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
