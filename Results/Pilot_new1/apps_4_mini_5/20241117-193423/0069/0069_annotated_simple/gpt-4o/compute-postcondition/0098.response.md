The code `results.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The previous values of the affected variable `results` are not specified, but the operation does not change any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `0` to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to index `i`; the balance is equal to 0, indicating that the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` are equal up to the last index considered. The value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`; `results` now includes an additional value 0.**
