Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, then if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; otherwise, it includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is initialized to 0, and for each element `b` in `prefix_balances`, if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `count` is incremented. Finally, `results` contains the value of `count`. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros and `results` is unaffected by the loop.***
