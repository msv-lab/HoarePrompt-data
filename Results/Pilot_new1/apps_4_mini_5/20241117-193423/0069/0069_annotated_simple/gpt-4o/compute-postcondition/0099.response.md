Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes an additional value 0. This indicates that the balance of '0's and '1's in the string remains equal up to the last index considered, regardless of whether `x` was present or not.***
