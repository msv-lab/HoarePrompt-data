Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums calculated from `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance up to index `i - 1`. The variable `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times; otherwise, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.***
