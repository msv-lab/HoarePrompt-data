The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `data[index + 2]` corresponds to `data[3]`. The initial states of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `results` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer from `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer from `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `results` is an empty list**
