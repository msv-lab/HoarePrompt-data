The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The `prefix_balances` and `balance` variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `prefix_balances` and `balance`, along with the addition of `0` to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, and `results` has 0 appended to it**
