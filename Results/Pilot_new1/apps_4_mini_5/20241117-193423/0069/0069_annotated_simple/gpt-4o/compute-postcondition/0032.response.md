According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements. Additionally, since the loop iterates over `b`, we need to adjust `b` to the next element in `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`**
