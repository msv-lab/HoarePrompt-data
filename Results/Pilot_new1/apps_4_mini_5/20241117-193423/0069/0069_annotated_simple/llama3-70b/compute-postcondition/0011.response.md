Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string from input, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, and it is not the case that `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`***
