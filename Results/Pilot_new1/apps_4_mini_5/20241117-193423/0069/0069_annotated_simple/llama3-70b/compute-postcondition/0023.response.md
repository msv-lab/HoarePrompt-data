Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which handles cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` leading to a division by zero, as well as ensuring that the output reflects the relationship between `x`, `balance`, and the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`.***
