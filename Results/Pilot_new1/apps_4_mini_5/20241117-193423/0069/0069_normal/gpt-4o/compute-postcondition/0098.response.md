The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list and does not affect the `results` list. The previous values of `results` are unknown, but a new value `0` is added to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that a `0` has been appended to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`; a `0` has been appended to `results`.**
