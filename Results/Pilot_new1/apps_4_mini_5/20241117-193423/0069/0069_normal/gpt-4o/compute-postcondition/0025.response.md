Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index in `s` results in a total balance of 0. If `x` exists in `prefix_balances`, `results` has -1 appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has 0 appended to it. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times and `balance` is 0; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and `balance` is 0.***
