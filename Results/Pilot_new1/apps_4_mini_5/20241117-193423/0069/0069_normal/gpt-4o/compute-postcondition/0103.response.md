Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0; `count` is initialized to 0; `b` is the last element in `prefix_balances`; `x` is an integer; `balance` is a non-zero integer; the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance`, and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is a non-negative integer.***
