Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `1 <= i <= n`) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to that index, calculated as `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros.**
