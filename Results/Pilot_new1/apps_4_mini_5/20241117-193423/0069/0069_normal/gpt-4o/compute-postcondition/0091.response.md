The code assigns a new value to `prefix_balances[i]`. The new value is calculated by taking the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and adding either 1 or -1 depending on whether the character at index `i - 1` in string `s` is '0' or not. 

Since `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros initially, `prefix_balances[i - 1]` will be 0, as long as `i - 1` is within the bounds of the list. The value added will be 1 if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or -1 if it is not.

Therefore, the output state will depend on the value of `s[i - 1]`:
- If `s[i - 1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
- If `s[i - 1]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:
- `prefix_balances` has been updated at index `i` to either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index `i` to either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**.
