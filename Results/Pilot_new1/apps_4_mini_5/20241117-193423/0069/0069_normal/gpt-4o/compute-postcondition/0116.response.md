According to the code, the loop iterates `T` times. The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable, indicating that the specific value of the loop variable is not needed in the loop body. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `T` must be greater than the current iteration count. Since the task does not provide the current iteration count, we can infer that it must be adjusted to reflect that the loop has executed `T - 1` times, meaning `T` should be at least 1 more than the current count.

If `T` is currently 1, the next iteration would need `T` to be at least 2. Therefore, we need to adjust `T` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0 or not 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances` or not, `results` contains -1 or 0 or a count, `T` is greater than 0**
