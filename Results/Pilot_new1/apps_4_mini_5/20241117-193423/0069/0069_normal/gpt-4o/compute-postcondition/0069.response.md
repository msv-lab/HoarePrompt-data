According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `prefix_balances` list. For the loop to execute one more time, it must have at least one more element after the current element `b`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, and `b` should be updated to the next element in the list.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements and that `b` is now the second element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`**
