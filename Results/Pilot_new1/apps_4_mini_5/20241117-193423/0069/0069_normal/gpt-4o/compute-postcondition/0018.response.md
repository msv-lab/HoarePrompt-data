According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts with `i` at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, which means `i` needs to be adjusted to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged since there is no indication that it has changed.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and the value of `s[n - 1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is unchanged**
