The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is unknown, but it is converted to an integer and then assigned to `x`. The other variables `balance`, `results`, `n`, and `prefix_balances` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has -1 appended to it, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with zeros.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has -1 appended to it, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with zeros**
