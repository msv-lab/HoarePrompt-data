Output State: **`prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index in `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the sum of the first `i` characters in `s` (counting '0's as +1 and '1's as -1). If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, and `i` will take values from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of length 1 filled with zeros.**
