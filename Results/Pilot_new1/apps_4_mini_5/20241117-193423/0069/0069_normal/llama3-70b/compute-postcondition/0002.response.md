The code assigns values to `n` and `x` by taking input and mapping it to integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not specified, but they will be updated based on the input provided. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and `x` is an integer between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000, the output state reflects that `n` and `x` will now hold the new values from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer**
