Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `x` is equal to `balance`, the function prints -1 to avoid division by zero. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring all cases regarding the balance and counts of '0's and '1's are accounted for.***
