The values of `n` and `x` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n` and `x` are overwritten with the new values from the input. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values for `n` and `x`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is the new input positive integer, `x` is the new input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
