Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in `s` and constructs prefix balances to determine how many ways `x` can be formed using the balance. If the balance is zero and `x` is found in the prefix balances, it appends -1 to the results; if not found, it appends 0. If the balance is not zero, it counts valid indices in prefix balances that satisfy specific conditions and appends this count to the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case. If there are no test cases (`T` is 0), nothing is printed. Edge cases include when `n` is less than 1, which results in no calculations being performed, and when `T` is 0, leading to an empty output. **
