The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The state of the other variables, including `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `-1` has been added to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `balance` is 0, `x` is one of the balances present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**.
