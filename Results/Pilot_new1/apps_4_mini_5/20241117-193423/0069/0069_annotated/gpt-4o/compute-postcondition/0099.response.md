Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in string `s`, and `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains an additional element, 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and `results` is updated accordingly based on the presence of `x`.***
