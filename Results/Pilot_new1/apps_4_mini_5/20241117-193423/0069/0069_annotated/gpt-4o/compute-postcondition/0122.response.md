According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, and for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements. The `result` will need to be the third element in the list during the next iteration.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `balance` is 0, and the function prints `results`**
