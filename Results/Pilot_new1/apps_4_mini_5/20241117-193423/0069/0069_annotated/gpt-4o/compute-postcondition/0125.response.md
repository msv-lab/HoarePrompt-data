Output State: **If `results` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute and print each element of `results`. If `results` is empty, the loop does not execute and nothing is printed. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, and the loop does not execute, leaving `results` unchanged. If `T` is 0, the outer loop does not execute at all, and `results` remains an empty list.**
