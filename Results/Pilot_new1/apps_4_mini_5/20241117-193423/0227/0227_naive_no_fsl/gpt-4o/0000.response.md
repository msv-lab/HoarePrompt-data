To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and functionality of the code.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. You have a sequence of distinct positive integers.
2. You need to determine the minimum number of variables `m` such that you can perform a sequence of operations:
   - The first operation assigns the first integer to a variable.
   - Subsequent operations assign the sum of values from two variables to a new variable, ensuring that the value assigned equals the next integer in the sequence.
3. If it's impossible to perform the operations, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        assigned.add(a[i])
    return m
```

#### Key Observations:
1. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted, which is necessary for the logic that follows.
2. **Assigned Set**: The `assigned` set keeps track of the values that have been assigned to variables.
3. **Logic for Forming New Values**: For each subsequent value in `a`, the code checks if it can be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values.
4. **Incrementing `m`**: If a value cannot be formed, the count of variables `m` is incremented.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Single Element Case**: For `n = 1`, the only integer can always be assigned to a single variable, so the output should be `1`.
2. **Impossible Cases**: The code should return `-1` if it's impossible to form the required sums. For example, if `a = [3, 6, 5]`, the program should output `-1` because `5` cannot be formed by any sum of previously assigned variables.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `1` with `a = [5]`, the output should be `1`.
- For the input `3` with `a = [3, 6, 5]`, the output should be `-1`.
- For the input `6` with `a = [2, 4, 8, 6, 10, 18]`, the output should be `3`.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the program does not correctly handle cases where the required sums cannot be formed. Specifically, it does not return `-1` when it's impossible to perform the operations as specified in the problem description. 

For example, in the case of `a = [3, 6, 5]`, the program would incorrectly increment `m` without recognizing that `5` cannot be formed from any combination of previously assigned sums.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
