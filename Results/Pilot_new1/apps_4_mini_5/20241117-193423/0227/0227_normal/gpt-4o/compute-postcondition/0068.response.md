Output State: **`m` is the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in `assigned`. `assigned` contains the elements from `a` that have been processed. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `m` remains 1. If `n` is greater than 1, the loop executes `n-1` times, and `m` can increase depending on whether `can_form` is False for each element `a[i]`. If at any point `assigned` is empty, `can_form` will be False, leading to an increment of `m`.**
