Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, indicating that there does not exist an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[3]` and that element is also in `assigned`. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop has not found a valid pair; if `assigned` is empty, then `can_form` remains False.***
