Output State: **If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. After the execution, if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[3]` and that element is also in `assigned`, then `m` does not change; otherwise, `m` is increased by 1. In the case where `assigned` is empty, `can_form` is also False, leading to an increment of `m` by 1. `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[i]`.**
