The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables alongside the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
