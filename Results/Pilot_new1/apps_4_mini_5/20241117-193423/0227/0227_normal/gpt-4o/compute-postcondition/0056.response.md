Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
