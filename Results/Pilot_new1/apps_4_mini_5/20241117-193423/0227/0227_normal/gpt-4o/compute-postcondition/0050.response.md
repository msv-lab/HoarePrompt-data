The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`assigned` has at least 1 element (specifically `a[3]`), `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the difference between `a[3]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`.**
