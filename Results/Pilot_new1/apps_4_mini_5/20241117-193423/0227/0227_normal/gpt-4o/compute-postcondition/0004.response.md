According to the code, the for loop will execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, as the range function will produce no values if `n` is 1. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23, we need to ensure that `n` is adjusted to be at least 2. Additionally, since `i` starts at 1, we need to set `i` to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
