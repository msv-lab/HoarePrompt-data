The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables: `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, or `i`, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False**
