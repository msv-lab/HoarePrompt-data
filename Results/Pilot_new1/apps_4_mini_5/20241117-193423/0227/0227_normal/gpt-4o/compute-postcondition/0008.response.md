The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, changing its previous state from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`**
