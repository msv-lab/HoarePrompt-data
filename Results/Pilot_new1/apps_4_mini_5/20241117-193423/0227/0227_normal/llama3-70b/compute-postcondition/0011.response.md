According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, and `i` will need to be incremented to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted since `m`'s value does not affect the loop's execution condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 3**
