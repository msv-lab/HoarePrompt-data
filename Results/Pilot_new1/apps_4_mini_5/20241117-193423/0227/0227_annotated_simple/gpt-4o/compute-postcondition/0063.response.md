Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer increased by 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty list, `can_form` is False. If the loop executed, `x` is the last element of `assigned` in the first iteration, the second to last in the second, and so on; however, no valid `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` to set `can_form` to True.***
