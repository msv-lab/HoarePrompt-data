Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, resulting in `m` being incremented by 2 overall. `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, and `assigned` is a non-empty list. If `can_form` was initially False, it remains unchanged regardless of the loop execution, and if `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute. If `assigned` contains elements but none satisfy the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False after the loop execution.***
