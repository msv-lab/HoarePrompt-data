Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False unless `a[i] - x` is an element of `assigned`, in which case `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `i` is 2, and `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False.***
