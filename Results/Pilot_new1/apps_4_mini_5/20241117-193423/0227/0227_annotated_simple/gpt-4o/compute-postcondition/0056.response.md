Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `x` is the second to last element of `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating a successful condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
