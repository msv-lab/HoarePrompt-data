The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `i` is 2, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged**
