Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists at least one value in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that value is also in `assigned`. If no such value exists after iterating through all elements in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 1, `i` remains 1, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers.**
