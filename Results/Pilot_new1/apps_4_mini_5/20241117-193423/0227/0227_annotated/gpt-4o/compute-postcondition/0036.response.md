According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `assigned` collection. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and `m` remains 2. 

Since `x` is the next element in `assigned`, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be updated to the next element in the `assigned` collection. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `x` needs to be the next element in `assigned` after the current one.
- The loop will continue executing as long as there are elements left in `assigned`.

State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned` (after the current one)**
