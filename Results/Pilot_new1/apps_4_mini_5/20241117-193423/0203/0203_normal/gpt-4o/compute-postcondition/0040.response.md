Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until at least one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, it means all 'D' characters lost their contests, and `r_queue` will contain the remaining indices of 'R' characters, potentially with new indices added from the contests. Conversely, if `r_queue` is empty, it indicates all 'R' characters lost, and `d_queue` will contain the remaining indices of 'D' characters. If either queue is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and the respective queue remains unchanged. Therefore, at the end of the loop, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty, and the other will contain the indices of the characters that won their contests, with possible new indices added based on the value of `n`.**
