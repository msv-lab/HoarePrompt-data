The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The variable `votes` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` based on the user input while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within 1 to 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
