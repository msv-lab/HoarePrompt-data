The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `votes` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list.
