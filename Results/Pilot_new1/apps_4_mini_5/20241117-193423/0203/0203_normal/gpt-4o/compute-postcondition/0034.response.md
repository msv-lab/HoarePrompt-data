The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has at least 1 element, `d_index` will hold the value of that first element, and `d_queue` will have one less element after the operation.

The state of `r_queue` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` remains unchanged**
