The code appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and the state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer within 3 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length at least 3; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character in the string `votes`, and `r_queue` now contains the value 2 appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 3 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length at least 3; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character in the string `votes`; `r_queue` contains 2**
