According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string. The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, the state indicates that `fractions` is a non-empty string and we have already processed the first character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state regarding the remaining characters in `fractions` and the current iteration index.

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one character left in the `fractions` string after the current character has been processed. If we have already processed the first character, the remaining string should have at least one character.

Thus, we can adjust the state as follows:
- The length of `fractions` must be at least 2, ensuring that there is a next character to process.
- The loop variable `fraction` should be updated to reflect the next character in the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 1 character remaining, fraction is the second character in the string**
