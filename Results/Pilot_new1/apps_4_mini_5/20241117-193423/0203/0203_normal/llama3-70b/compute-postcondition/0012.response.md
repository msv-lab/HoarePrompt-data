The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. Since `remocrats` is either 0 or 1, the new value of `remocrats` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is either 1 or 0; `remocrats` is either 1 or 2.
