Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is either 1 or 0, and `remocrats` is either 0 or 1. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 while `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is 'R', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1 while `depublicans` remains 0. Thus, exactly one of `depublicans` or `remocrats` will be 1, reflecting the count of the respective party based on the value of `fraction` while the other remains 0.***
