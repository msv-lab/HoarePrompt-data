The variable `remocrats` is assigned the value of 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 200,000), `fractions` (an input string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'), and `depublicans` (which is 0). The assignment of `remocrats` does not affect these other variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is an input string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is an input string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
