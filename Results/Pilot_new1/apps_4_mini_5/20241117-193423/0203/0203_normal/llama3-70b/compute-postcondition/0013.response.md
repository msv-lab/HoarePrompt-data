Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; if the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 (resulting in either 2 if it was originally 1, or 3 if it was originally 2), while `remocrats` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1). Otherwise, if the first character of `fractions` is 'R', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1 (resulting in either 1 if it was originally 0, or 2 if it was originally 1), while `depublicans` remains unchanged (either 1 or 2).***
