Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `n` is the total number of characters in `fractions`. If `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are 0. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop has executed exactly `n` times, counting each character in `fractions`.***
