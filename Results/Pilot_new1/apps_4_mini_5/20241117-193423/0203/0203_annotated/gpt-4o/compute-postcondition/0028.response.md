The operation `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has at least one element remaining, `d_index` will be assigned the value of that first element, and `d_queue` will now have one less element. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_queue` has at least one element remaining**.
