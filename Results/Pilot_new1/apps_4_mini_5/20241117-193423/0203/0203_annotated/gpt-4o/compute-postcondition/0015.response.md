The `d_queue` is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The previous state of `d_queue` could either be [0, 1] or [1] if `v` is 'D', or it could be [0] or empty if `v` is not 'D'. However, since we are appending 2 to `d_queue`, the new state will include this value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated `d_queue` and the unchanged values of `n`, `votes`, `r_queue`, and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string with at least 3 characters; `d_queue` is either [0, 1, 2], [1, 2], [2], or [2] if previously empty; `r_queue` remains empty; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character in `votes`.**
