Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, while `r_queue` contains the indices of characters that are not 'D'. After the loop executes, if `votes` is non-empty, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; if `votes` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.**
