Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is a non-empty queue, `r_queue` may be empty or non-empty. The loop has executed, and the elements of `r_queue` have been incremented by `n` while `d_queue` remains unchanged. If `r_queue` is empty, then `d_queue` contains elements that have been incremented by `n`. If `r_queue` is non-empty, both queues contain their respective elements, with `r_queue` elements incremented by `n`.***
