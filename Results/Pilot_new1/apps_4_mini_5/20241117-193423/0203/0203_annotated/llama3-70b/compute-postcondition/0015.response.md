The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, `fraction`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one, and `depublicans` is increased by 1**
