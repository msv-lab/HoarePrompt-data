Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string. If `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and remains 1, while `remocrats` remains 0. If `fractions` is not 'D', then `depublicans` remains 0 and `remocrats` is increased by 1, resulting in `remocrats` being 1.***
