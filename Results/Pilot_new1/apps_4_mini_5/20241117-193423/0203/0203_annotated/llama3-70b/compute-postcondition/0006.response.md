The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `depublicans` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 1, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
