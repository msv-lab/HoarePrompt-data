The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), but it will change based on user input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
