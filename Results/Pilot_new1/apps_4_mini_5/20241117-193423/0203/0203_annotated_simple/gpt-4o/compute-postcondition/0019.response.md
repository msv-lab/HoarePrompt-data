Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of non-'D' characters in `votes`. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `votes` contains only 'D' characters, `r_queue` will be empty and `d_queue` will contain all indices from 0 to n-1. If `votes` contains no 'D' characters, `d_queue` will be empty and `r_queue` will contain all indices from 0 to n-1.**
