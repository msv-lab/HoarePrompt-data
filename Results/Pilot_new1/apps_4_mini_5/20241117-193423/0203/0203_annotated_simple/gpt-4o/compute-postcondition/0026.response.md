Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of non-'D' characters in `votes` after removing the first element. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is updated to include `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated to include `r_index + n`, where `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue` after popping it, and `r_index` is the popped first index from `r_queue`. This ensures that the relative ordering of indices in both queues is maintained after the operation.***
