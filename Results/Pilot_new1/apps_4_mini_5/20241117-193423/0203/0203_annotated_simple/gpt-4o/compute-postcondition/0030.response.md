The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` will change to include this new value, while `r_queue`, `r_index`, and any other variables remain unaffected. The specific values of `d_index` and `n` are not provided, but the operation will still succeed based on their current values.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (d_index + n), `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped**.
