The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped. After this operation, `r_queue` will have one less element, while `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less index after popping the first element, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index after popping the first element, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was popped.**
