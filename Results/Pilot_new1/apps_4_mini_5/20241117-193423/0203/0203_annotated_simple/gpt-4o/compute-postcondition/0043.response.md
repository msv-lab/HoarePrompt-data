Postcondition: ***`votes` is an empty string or `d_queue` is empty, and `r_queue` contains all indices from 0 to n-1. If `votes` contains only 'D' characters, then `r_queue` is empty and `d_queue` contains all indices from 0 to n-1. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will not execute. If `d_queue` is empty, then `r_queue` contains shifted indices of non-'D' characters. If `r_queue` is empty, then `d_queue` contains shifted indices of 'D' characters.***
