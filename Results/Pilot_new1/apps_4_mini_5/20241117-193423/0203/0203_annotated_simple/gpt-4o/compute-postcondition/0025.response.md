The `r_queue` is updated by appending the value `r_index + n` to it. The values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_index` remain unchanged. Since `r_index` is from `r_queue` and it has been popped, it is not part of the current state of `r_queue` anymore. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of non-'D' characters in `votes` after removing the first element and now includes `r_index + n`, `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue` after popping it, and `r_index` is the popped first index from `r_queue`, with `d_index` greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
