The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from the input function, which splits the input string and converts each part to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified, but they are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers assigned from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers assigned from input**
