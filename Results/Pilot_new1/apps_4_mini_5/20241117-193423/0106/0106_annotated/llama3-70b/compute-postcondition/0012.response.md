Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `min_block_time` is defined; and the result of `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` is displayed.**
