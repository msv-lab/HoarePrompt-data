The value of `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the result of the expression `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The previous value of `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, but it remains unaffected by this line of code. The state of the other variables is not specified, so we cannot determine their values. Therefore, the output state is: `direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
