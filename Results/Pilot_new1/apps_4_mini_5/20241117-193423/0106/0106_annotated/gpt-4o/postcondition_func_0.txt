The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the dimensions of a building, and two distinct integers `a` and `b`, which represent apartment numbers. It calculates the total time taken to exit from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, considering the time to exit the floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function returns the total time as the sum of these components. However, the function does not handle cases where `get_location(a)` or `get_location(b)` might return invalid results, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
