Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly but reads five integers from input: three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to move between two points in a grid-like structure defined by these integers, based on their respective block and floor positions. The function then prints the total time, which is the sum of the time taken to move between blocks and floors. It does not handle cases where the input values are outside the specified constraints or where `a` and `b` are not distinct. **
