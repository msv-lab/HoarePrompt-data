Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the function prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
