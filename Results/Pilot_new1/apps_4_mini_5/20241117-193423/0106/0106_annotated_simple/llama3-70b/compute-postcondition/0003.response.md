The value of `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The previous values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on the input values. The calculation involves integer division of `(a - 1)` by the product of `m` and `k`, and then adding 1 to the result.

Since `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, `a_block` will also be a positive integer. The output state will reflect the updated value of `a_block` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on the input values; `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**
