The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input, where the input consists of three positive integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` can range between 1 and 1000. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown as they are being assigned new values. The output state will reflect that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now positive integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on the input values**
