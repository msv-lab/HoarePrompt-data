To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the provided initial conditions and the operation performed by the code.

The code snippet:
```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

In this case, we are calculating the value of `block` based on the value of `apartment`, which is not defined in the initial state but is implied to be a positive integer. The values of `m` and `k` are given as positive integers within the specified range.

1. **Variables involved**:
   - `apartment`: a positive integer (not defined in the initial state).
   - `m`: a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000).
   - `k`: a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000).

2. **Operation**:
   - The expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k)` computes the integer division of `(apartment - 1)` by the product of `m` and `k`.
   - Then, `1` is added to the result of the integer division to get the final value of `block`.

Since `apartment` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `block`. However, we can state that `block` is a positive integer resulting from the calculation based on the input values.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `block` is computed based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
