The variable `direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`. The expression `abs(block_a - block_b)` computes the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, which is then taken modulo `n`. This result is multiplied by 15 to determine `direct_walk_time`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `direct_walk_time`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation but does not specify numerical values. The output state is: `direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`**
