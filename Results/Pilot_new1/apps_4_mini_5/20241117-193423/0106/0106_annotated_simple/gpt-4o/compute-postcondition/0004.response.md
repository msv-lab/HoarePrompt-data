The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The parameter `apartment` is an integer that represents a specific apartment number within a structure defined by the parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`. The function calculates the values of `block` and `floor` based on the given apartment number. The `floor` is determined by the formula `(floor_within_block // k + 1)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` values based on the apartment's position within a multi-block structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor', where 'floor' is calculated as (floor_within_block // k + 1).**
