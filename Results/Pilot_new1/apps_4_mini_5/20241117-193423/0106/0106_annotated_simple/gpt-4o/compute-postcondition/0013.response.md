The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers constrained by the condition that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `total_time`, which is calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the calculated `total_time` based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), and a, b (integers), and returns the value of total_time calculated from time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.**
