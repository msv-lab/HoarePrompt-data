The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, it returns the total time calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), and a, b (integers representing apartment numbers), and returns the total time calculated based on the provided formula.**
