Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `time_to_exit` is either 0 (if `floor_a` is 1) or `floor_a + 9` (if `floor_a` is greater than 1); `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
