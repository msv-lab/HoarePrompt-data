The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `apartment` is one of the integers `a` or `b`, which are distinct integers in the range of 1 to `n * m * k`. 

The output state will reflect the calculation of `floor_within_block` based on the value of `apartment`, which is either `a` or `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
