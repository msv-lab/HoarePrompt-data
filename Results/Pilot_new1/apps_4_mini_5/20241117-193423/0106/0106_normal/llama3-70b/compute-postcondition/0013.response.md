The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that both are within the range of 1 to `n·m·k` and `a` is not equal to `b`. 

The function's output or return value is not detailed in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and a, b are integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k) such that a ≠ b. The specific return value of the function is not provided.**
