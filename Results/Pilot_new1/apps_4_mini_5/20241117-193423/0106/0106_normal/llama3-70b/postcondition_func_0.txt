The function accepts five positive integers: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to travel between two points in a grid defined by these parameters. The calculation involves determining the block and floor levels for both points, computing the time taken to move between blocks and floors, and summing these times. The function prints the total time, which accounts for both block transitions (at a rate of 15 units of time per block) and floor transitions (at a rate of 5 units of time per floor, plus an additional 10 units for the initial transition). The function does not return any value.
