The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No', and the program exits.
