According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to 4. Since `k` is at least 3, it allows for `i` to be 4 and still be less than or equal to `k` if `k` is at least 4. Therefore, we need to ensure `k` is at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted since `seen_remainders` is an empty set and `remainder` being either 0 or 1 does not affect the loop execution in this context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `seen_remainders` is an empty set; `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
