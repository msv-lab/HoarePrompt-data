Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, and the state of `seen_remainders` remains unchanged.***
