The code initializes an empty set called `seen_remainders`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain unchanged. The output state reflects the initialization of the set and the unchanged values of the integers.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
