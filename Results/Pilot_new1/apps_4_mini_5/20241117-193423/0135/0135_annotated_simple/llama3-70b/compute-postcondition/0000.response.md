The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a line of input, splits it into separate values, converts those values to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, so they will hold the values provided by the user. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers**
