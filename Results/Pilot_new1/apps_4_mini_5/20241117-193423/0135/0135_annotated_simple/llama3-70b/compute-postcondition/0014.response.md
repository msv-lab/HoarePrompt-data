The code adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The initial state indicates that `seen` already contains the value of `remainder`, which can be either 0 or 1. If `remainder` was already in `seen`, the program would have printed 'No' and exited before reaching this line of code. Therefore, we can conclude that `remainder` is not in `seen` at this point, allowing the addition to proceed.

The output state reflects that `remainder` has been added to `seen`, which will now contain both its previous values and the new value of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains both its previous values and the value of `remainder`.**
