The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Since `i` is 3, the value of `remainder` will be either `n % 3`, which can be 0 or 1 depending on the value of `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
