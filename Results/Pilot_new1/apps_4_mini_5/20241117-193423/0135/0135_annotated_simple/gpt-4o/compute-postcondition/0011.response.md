According to the code, the loop can execute again if the variable `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to 3.
- `k` should be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
