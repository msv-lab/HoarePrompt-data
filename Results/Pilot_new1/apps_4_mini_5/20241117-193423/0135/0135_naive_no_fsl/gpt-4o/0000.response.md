To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The problem states that we need to check if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program takes two integers `n` and `k`, and checks the following conditions:

1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it immediately returns "No". This is because for any `i` in the range from `1` to `n`, `n % i` will yield a remainder that can repeat, particularly because `n % n` is `0` and `n % 1` is `0`.

2. If `k` is less than `n`, it initializes a set to keep track of seen remainders and iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`. If a remainder is found that has already been seen, it returns "No". If all remainders are distinct, it returns "Yes".

Now, let's consider edge cases:

- When `k` is `1`: The only remainder calculated will be `n % 1`, which is always `0`. The program will return "No" because it doesn't check for the uniqueness of a single remainder.
- When `k` is `2` and `n` is `2`: The remainders would be `n % 1 = 0` and `n % 2 = 0`, which are not distinct. The program will return "No", which is correct.
- When `k` is `3` and `n` is `4`: The remainders would be `4 % 1 = 0`, `4 % 2 = 0`, and `4 % 3 = 1`. The program will return "No", which is correct.
- When `k` is `4` and `n` is `4`: The remainders would be `4 % 1 = 0`, `4 % 2 = 0`, `4 % 3 = 1`, and `4 % 4 = 0`. The program will return "No", which is correct.

However, let's consider a case where `k` is less than `n`:

- For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the remainders would be `5 % 1 = 0` and `5 % 2 = 1`, which are distinct. The program will return "Yes", which is correct.
- But if we take `n = 10` and `k = 5`: the remainders would be `10 % 1 = 0`, `10 % 2 = 0`, `10 % 3 = 1`, `10 % 4 = 2`, `10 % 5 = 0`. The program will return "No", which is correct.

Now, let's consider the edge case where `k` is significantly larger than `n`:

- If `n = 1` and `k = 10^18`, the remainders would be `1 % 1 = 0`, `1 % 2 = 1`, `1 % 3 = 1`, and so forth. The program will return "No" because `1 % 1 = 0` and `1 % 2 = 1` are not distinct.

The program does not handle the case when `k` is larger than `n` correctly since it will return "No" immediately without checking for distinctness of remainders, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement for all potential cases. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly check for distinct remainders when `k` is greater than `n`, as it prematurely returns "No" without evaluating the actual remainders when `k` is greater than `n`.
