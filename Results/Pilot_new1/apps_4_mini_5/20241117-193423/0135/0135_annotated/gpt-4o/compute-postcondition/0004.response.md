According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to `k`, inclusive. However, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No', and the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be less than `n`. 

Additionally, before the loop starts, the variable `i` must be initialized to 1, as that is the starting point of the range in the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
