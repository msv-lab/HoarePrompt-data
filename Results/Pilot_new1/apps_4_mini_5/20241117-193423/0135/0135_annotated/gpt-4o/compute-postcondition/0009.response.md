According to the code, the loop is set to execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and since `k` is less than `n`, we can assume that `k` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

The conditions regarding `n`, `k`, `seen_remainders`, and `remainder` do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop to execute; they remain the same. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is for `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is less than `n`, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0**
