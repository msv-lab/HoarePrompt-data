According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4.

Since `k` is greater than or equal to 3, it can be either 3 or greater. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be incremented to 4.
- `k` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 4, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1; `seen` now contains `remainder`.**
