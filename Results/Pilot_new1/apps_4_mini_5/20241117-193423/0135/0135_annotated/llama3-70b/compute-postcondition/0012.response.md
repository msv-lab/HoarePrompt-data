The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program ends. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**
