Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is greater than \( n \) correctly. For example, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \), the program will calculate the remainders for \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \). The remainders will be \( 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 5 \), which includes duplicates (specifically, \( 1 \) and \( 0 \)). However, since the program checks only up to \( k \) without considering the fact that the remainders can repeat for \( i > n \), it incorrectly concludes that all remainders are distinct. Hence, the program fails for this case.
