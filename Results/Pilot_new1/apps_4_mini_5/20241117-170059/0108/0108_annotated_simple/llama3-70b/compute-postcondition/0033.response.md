The value of `s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` (which is 'z') with the character that has the ASCII value of `ord(char) + 1`. The ASCII value of 'z' is 122, so `ord('z') + 1` gives us 123, which corresponds to the character '{'. 

Since `s` is initially '{' and includes 'z', the first occurrence of 'z' in `s` will be replaced with '{'. However, since `s` is already '{', it remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'axzzz', `s` is '{', and `char` is 'z', and after the replacement, `s` remains '{'.

Output State: **`res` is 'axzzz', `s` is '{', `char` is 'z'**
