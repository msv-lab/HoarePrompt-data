The variable `res` is updated by appending `char` to its current value. The previous value of `res` is 'aza', and `char` is 'b'. After the execution of the code, `res` becomes 'azab'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is 'b', `res` is 'azab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is 'azab', `char` is 'b'**
