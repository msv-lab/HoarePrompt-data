Output State: **`if char is 'z' and 'z' is in s then res` is 'az', `s` becomes 'a' with 'z' replaced by 'a', `char` is 'z'. If char is 'y' and 'y' is in s then res is 'ay', `s` becomes 'b' with 'y' replaced by 'z', `char` is 'z'. If char is 'x' and 'x' is in s then res is 'ax', `s` becomes 'c' with 'x' replaced by 'y', `char` is 'y'. The loop will execute for each character in the alphabet found in `s` until `char` becomes 'z' and is no longer in `s`, at which point it will terminate. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will not execute and `res` will remain the empty string, `s` will remain unchanged, and `char` will remain 'z'.**
