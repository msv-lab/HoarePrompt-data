According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'b', `res` is 'aza', and `char` is 'a'. Since `char` ('a') is not present in `s` ('b'), the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to be a character that is in `s`. Since `s` is 'b', `char` should be adjusted to 'b'.

State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is 'aza', `char` is 'b'**
