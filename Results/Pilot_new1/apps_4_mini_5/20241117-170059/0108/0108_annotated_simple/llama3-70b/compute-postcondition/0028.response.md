According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is 'z' and `s` is '{'. Since 'z' is not in '{', the loop cannot execute again without adjusting the state. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` needs to include 'z'. Therefore, we need to adjust `s` to contain 'z'.

State: **`res` is 'axz', `s` is '{' and `s` includes 'z'**
