According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the contents of `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is '{' and includes 'z', but we do not know the value of `char`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be a character that is present in `s`. Since `s` includes 'z', one possible adjustment is to set `char` to 'z'. However, we also need to ensure that `char` is defined in such a way that it allows the loop to continue.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- Set `char` to 'z'.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`res` is 'axzz', `s` is '{', `s` includes 'z', and `char` is 'z'**
