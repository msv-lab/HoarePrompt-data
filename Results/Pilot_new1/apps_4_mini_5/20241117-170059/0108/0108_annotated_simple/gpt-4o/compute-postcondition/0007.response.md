The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`s`, `j`, `target`, and `target_len`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 0 or 1 (depending on the comparison with `target`), `i` is 1, and the values of `target` and `target_len` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, and `target` and `target_len` remain unchanged**
