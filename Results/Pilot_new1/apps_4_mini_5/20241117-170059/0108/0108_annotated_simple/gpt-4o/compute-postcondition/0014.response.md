Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `target_len` is greater than 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
