Output State: **`if 'a' is present in s then res` is a string consisting of consecutive 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in the original string, `s` will have the first 'a' replaced by 'b' for each occurrence, and `char` will eventually be 'b' after the loop finishes. If 'a' is not present in s, the loop does not execute, `res` remains an empty string, and `s` remains unchanged.`**
