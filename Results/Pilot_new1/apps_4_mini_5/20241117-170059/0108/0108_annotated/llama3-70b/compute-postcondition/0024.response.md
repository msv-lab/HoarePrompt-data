Output State: **`if 'a' is present in s then res` will be a string consisting of consecutive 'a's followed by `char` repeated for each occurrence of 'a' in `s`, `s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', `char` will be 'c', and `alphabet` will contain characters after 'b'. If there are no 'a's in `s`, the loop will not execute, `res` will be an empty string, `s` will remain unchanged, `char` will be 'c', and `alphabet` will still contain characters after 'b'.**
