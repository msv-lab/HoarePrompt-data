Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, indicating a match with the next character in `target`. If `s[i]` is 'a', then `j` becomes 1; if `s[i]` is 'b', then `j` becomes 2, and so on, up to a maximum of 26. If `s[i]` does not match `target[j]`, `j` remains unchanged.***
