The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `s`.
