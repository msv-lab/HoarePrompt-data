`j` is incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The previous value of `j` is 0, so after the execution, `j` becomes 1. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `target` (which is 'a').
