The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The value of `j` remains unchanged, as it is either 0 or 1, depending on the character match condition. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is either 0 or 1.
