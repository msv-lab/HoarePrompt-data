The code updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, which is calculated using `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The variable `res` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned that it is updated by appending `char`, and `char` is still in `s` before the replacement.

Since `char` is still in `s`, we can conclude that the replacement will successfully occur. The output state reflects the changes made to `s` while keeping `res` and `char` as they were.

Output State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `res` is updated by appending `char`; `char` is still in `s`.**
