According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has had the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character. This means that if `char` was present in `s`, it has now been changed to a different character. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain the original `char`. 

Since `s` had its first occurrence of `char` replaced, we need to ensure that `s` still contains `char` after the replacement. This means we need to adjust the state to ensure `char` is still present in `s`.

State: **`res` is a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, `s` must still contain the original `char`**.
