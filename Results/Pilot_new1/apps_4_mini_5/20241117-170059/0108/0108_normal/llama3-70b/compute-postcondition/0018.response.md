The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. Since `res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, the new value of `res` will include all previous characters plus the new `char`. The original `char` remains in `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, and `res` has been updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, and `res` has been updated to include `char`**
