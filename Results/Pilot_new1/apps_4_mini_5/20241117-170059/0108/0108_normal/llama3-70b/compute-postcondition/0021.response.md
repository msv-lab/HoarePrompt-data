The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. Since `res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, the new value of `res` will include `char` at the end of the existing string. The state of `s` and other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, and now includes `char`.

Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, and now includes `char`**
