The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. Here, `char` is 'b', so `ord(char)` gives the ASCII value of 'b', which is 98. Adding 1 gives 99, and `chr(99)` corresponds to 'c'. The previous value of `s` is 'b', and after the replacement, `s` becomes 'c'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'**
