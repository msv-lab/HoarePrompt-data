Output State: **`total_sum` is equal to the sum of all numbers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop executes once, and the value of `total_sum` depends on whether `func_1(l, k)` returns true or false.**
