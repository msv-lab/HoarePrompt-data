According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), we can conclude that the loop will execute as long as the conditions for `l` and `r` are met. 

Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0, which does not affect the execution of the loop. However, we need to ensure that `num` starts from `l`, which is the first value in the range.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be established:
- `l` must be less than or equal to `r` (which is already guaranteed by the provided constraints).
- `num` should start at `l`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is l**
