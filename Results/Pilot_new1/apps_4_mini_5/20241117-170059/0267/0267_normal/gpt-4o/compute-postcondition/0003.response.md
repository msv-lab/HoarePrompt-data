The variable `total_sum` is updated with the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Given that `total_sum` is initially 0 and `num` is equal to `l`, we can calculate the new value of `total_sum`. 

Since `total_sum` is 0, the expression simplifies to `total_sum = (0 + l) % MOD`, which is equivalent to `total_sum = l % MOD`. The value of `l` is within the range specified (1 <= l <= r < 10^18), but the exact value of `l` is not provided. Therefore, we can only state that `total_sum` will be equal to `l % MOD`.

The other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, `num`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, and the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true.**
