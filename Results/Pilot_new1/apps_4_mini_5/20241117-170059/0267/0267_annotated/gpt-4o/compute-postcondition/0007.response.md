Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0 initially. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, where `num` is `l + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0.***
