According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, the condition is satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `num` will take the value of `l` in the first iteration. Since `total_sum` is initialized to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states can be kept as is, with `num` starting at `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
