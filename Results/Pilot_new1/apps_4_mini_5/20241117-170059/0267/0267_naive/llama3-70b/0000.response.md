To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to calculate the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits.
2. The result should be given modulo `998244353`.

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(l, r, k)` which uses a helper function `count(n, k, dp)` to count the numbers from `1` to `n` that have at most `k` different digits. 

- **Base Case**: If `k` is `0`, it returns `0`, which is appropriate since no digits would yield no valid numbers.
- **Memoization**: It uses a dictionary `dp` to store results of previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.
- **Counting Logic**:
  - If `n` is less than `10^k`, it returns `n`, which seems to imply that all numbers up to `n` are valid since they can have at most `k` different digits.
  - The program attempts to construct numbers with at most `k` different digits, but it is unclear if it accurately captures all valid combinations, especially for larger ranges or edge cases.

### Potential Issues:
1. The counting logic may not correctly account for all numbers with at most `k` different digits, especially when the number of digits in `n` is greater than `k`. 
2. The approach to count numbers with `k` different digits might miss certain combinations, especially when `l` and `r` have varying lengths or lead to overlaps in digit combinations.

### Test Case Consideration:
Consider the following test case:
- **Input**: `l = 100, r = 200, k = 1`
- **Expected Output**: The valid numbers are `100, 111, 122, 133, 144, 155, 166, 177, 188, 199`, which should sum to `100 + 111 + 122 + 133 + 144 + 155 + 166 + 177 + 188 + 199 = 1445`.

However, the program may not correctly handle this case due to its counting logic. If it fails to count or sum these correctly, the output will not match expectations.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential issues in counting numbers with at most `k` different digits and the example test case that could lead to incorrect behavior, I conclude that the program does not fully meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
