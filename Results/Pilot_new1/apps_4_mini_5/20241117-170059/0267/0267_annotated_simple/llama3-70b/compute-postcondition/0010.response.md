According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates for `i` in the range from 1 to `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\) (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). For the loop to execute, we need \(k\) to be at least 2.
- `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to \(10^k\) (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `dp[n, k]` is 9 (this does not affect the loop execution).

To ensure the loop executes, we must set `k` to at least 2. The initial value of `i` before the loop starts is 1, as the range for `i` is from 1 to `k - 1`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
