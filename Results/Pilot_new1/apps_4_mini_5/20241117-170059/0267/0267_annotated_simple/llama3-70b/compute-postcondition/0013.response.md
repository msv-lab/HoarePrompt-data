To analyze the given code snippet, we start by looking at the initial state and the operation being performed.

Initial State: 
- `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18
- `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18
- `k` is 2
- `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`
- `dp[n, k]` is 90
- `i` is 2

Now, we analyze the operation:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`:
   - Since `i` is 2, `10 ** (i - 1)` = `10 ** 1` = 10.

2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`:
   - Since `k` is 2 and `i` is 2, `10 ** (k - i)` = `10 ** (2 - 2)` = `10 ** 0` = 1.

3. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)` again (already calculated, it is 10).

4. Now substitute these values into the equation:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (1 - 10)
```
This simplifies to:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (-9)
dp[n, k] += -810
```

5. Now we update `dp[n, k]`:
   - The original value of `dp[n, k]` is 90.
   - After the operation, `dp[n, k]` becomes `90 - 810 = -720`.

The other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is -720, `i` is 2**
