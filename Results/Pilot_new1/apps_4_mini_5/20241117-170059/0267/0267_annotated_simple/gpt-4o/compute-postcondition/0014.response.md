The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers with the constraints that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer with the constraint that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns True, modulo `MOD`. If the conditions for `total_sum` are not met, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` defining a range, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers in that range that satisfy a condition defined by another function, or 0 if the conditions are not met.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l and r defining a range, and k, returning the sum of integers in that range for which func_1(num, k) returns True, modulo MOD, or 0 if conditions are not met.**
