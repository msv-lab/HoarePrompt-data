According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given the constraints that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, we can infer that the loop will execute as long as `l` and `r` are set correctly within the specified bounds.

At the start of the loop, `num` will take on the value of `l`, which is the first number in the specified range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is initialized to `l`, and the loop can execute as long as the condition `l <= r` holds true.

Since `total_sum` is initialized to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it will be updated during the loop iterations.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is `l`**
