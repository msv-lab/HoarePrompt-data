According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `r` is an integer such that r >= l + 2. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
- Since `num` is currently `l + 2`, the next value of `num` in the loop will be `num + 1`, which means `num` will become `l + 3`.
- We need to ensure that `num` (which will be `l + 3`) is still less than or equal to `r` for the loop to execute again.

Since `r` is at least `l + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `num` (which will be `l + 3`) is still valid under the condition that `num <= r`. Therefore, we need to adjust `r` to be at least `l + 3`.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that r >= l + 3, and `num` is equal to l + 3.**
