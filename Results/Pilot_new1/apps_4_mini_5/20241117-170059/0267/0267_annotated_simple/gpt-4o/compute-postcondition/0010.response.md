Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is 0 initially, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that r >= l + 2, and `num` is equal to l + 2. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(0 + num) % MOD`, which simplifies to `num % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, `total_sum` remains 0.***
