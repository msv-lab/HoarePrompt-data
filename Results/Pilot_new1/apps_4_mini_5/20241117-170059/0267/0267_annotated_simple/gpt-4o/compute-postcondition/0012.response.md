Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns True, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, or if the range is empty (i.e., if `l` is equal to `r` and `func_1(r, k)` returns False), then `total_sum` remains 0. If there are no integers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` will also remain 0.**
