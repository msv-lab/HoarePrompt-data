The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous state of the affected variables indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers based on user input. The initialization of `digits` does not affect these variables. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initialization of `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers based on user input; `digits` is an empty set**
