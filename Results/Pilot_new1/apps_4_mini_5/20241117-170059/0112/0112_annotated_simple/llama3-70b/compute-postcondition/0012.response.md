The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since the initial state specifies that `digits` contains the string '0', after executing this line, '0' will no longer be part of the set. The other elements in the set remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that '0' has been removed from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0'**
