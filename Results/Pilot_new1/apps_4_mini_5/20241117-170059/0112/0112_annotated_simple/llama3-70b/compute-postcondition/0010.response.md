Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all unique digits found in the lists within `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is 1, `cubes` contains at least one list of integers and `digits` will contain the unique string representations of the digits from that list. If `n` is 2, `cubes` contains two lists of integers, and `digits` will contain the unique string representations of the digits from both lists. If `n` is 3, `cubes` contains three lists of integers, and `digits` will contain the unique string representations of the digits from all three lists.**
