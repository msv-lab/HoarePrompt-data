The code snippet updates the `digits` set with string representations of the integers in the `cube` list. Since `n` is 3, `cubes` contains 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, the exact content of `cube` is needed to determine the resulting `digits`. However, we know that `digits` will now contain the string representations of each integer in `cube`. The previous state of `digits` is not specified, so we can only state that it gets updated.

Output State: **`n` is 3; `cubes` is a list of 3 lists of integers; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the digits in `cube`.**
