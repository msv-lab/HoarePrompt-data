According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each list in `cubes`, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the loop can execute at most `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is between 1 and 3, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more list in `cubes` after the current `cube`. Since `cube` is the first list, for the loop to continue, we need `cubes` to contain at least 2 lists, and `cube` should be updated to the second list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the digits in `cube`.**
