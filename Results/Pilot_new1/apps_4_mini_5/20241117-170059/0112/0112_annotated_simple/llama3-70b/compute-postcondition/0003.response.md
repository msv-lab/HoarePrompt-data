According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list, which is guaranteed since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. This means that `cubes` will have at least one list of integers. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `cube` will take the value of the first list in `cubes`. Therefore, the initial state of `cube` should reflect this. 

Given that `digits` is an empty set and does not affect the execution of the loop, it can remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
