According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the `digits` list has at least one character, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `digit` is set to the first character in the `digits` list. The `used_cubes` list does not directly affect the execution of the loop, but it is initialized and ready for use within the loop.

For the loop to be executed, the `digits` list must contain at least one character. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `digits` is not empty and that `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list.

State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [False] * n**
