The code `digits = list(str(num))` converts the integer `num` into a string and then creates a list of its characters (digits). The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, but the value of `num` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the impact of the code depends on the value of `num`, which can be any integer represented by `cube_faces`.

Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value or the resulting list of digits. Thus, the output state reflects that `digits` will be a list of characters corresponding to the string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, where `num` is an integer from `cube_faces`**
