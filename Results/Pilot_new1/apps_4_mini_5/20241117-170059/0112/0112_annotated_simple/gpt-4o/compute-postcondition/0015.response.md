According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `digits`, `digit`, and `used_cubes` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute again based on the provided conditions.

State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
