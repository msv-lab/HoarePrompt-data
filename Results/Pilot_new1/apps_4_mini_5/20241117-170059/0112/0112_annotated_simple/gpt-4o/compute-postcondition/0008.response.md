The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is updated to [True, False, ..., False], `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
