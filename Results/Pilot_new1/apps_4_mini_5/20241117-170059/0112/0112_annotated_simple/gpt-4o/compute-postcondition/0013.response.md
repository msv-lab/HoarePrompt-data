The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `used_cubes[0]` is set to True if `digit` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
