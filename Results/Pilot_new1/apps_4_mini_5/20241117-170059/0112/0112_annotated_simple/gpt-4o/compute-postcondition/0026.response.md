The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, which changes its state from either `True` or `False` to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged, and since `i` is undefined, it does not affect the output state. The `digits` variable has at least one more element than before, but this does not impact the assignment of `found`. Therefore, the Output State is: `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is undefined, `digits` has at least one more element than before.

Output State: **`used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is undefined, `digits` has at least one more element than before**
