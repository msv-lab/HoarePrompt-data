The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \). The parameter `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, with each integer in the range 0 to 9. 

After executing the function, the output is determined by the following cases:
- **Case 1:** If `n` is greater than 0 and `digits` has at least one character, the function will attempt to find each digit in `cube_faces`. If all digits are found, the function returns `True`. If any digit cannot be matched with the available `cube_faces`, the function returns `False`. If `n` is 0 or if `digits` is empty, the function does not execute the matching logic and returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and return `True` if all digits can be matched with the available cube faces; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists of integers `cube_faces`, and returns `True` if all digits can be matched with the available cube faces; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
