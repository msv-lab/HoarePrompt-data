Correctness: **False**

The program fails to account for the requirement that Masha cannot create the digit 6 from the digit 9 and vice-versa. The logic in the `can_form_number` function simply checks if the digits can be formed using the available cubes without considering the restriction on how 6 and 9 can be used. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
0 1 2 3 4 5
0 1 2 3 4 9
```

In this case, Masha can form the number 1 but cannot form 6 (since there is no cube with a 6) or 9 (since there is no cube with a 9). However, the program would incorrectly allow the formation of the number 9 using the cube that has a 9 on it, which violates the problem's constraints.

Thus, the program does not handle the constraints correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
