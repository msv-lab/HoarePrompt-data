The variable `cubes` is assigned a list that is created by a list comprehension. The comprehension iterates `n` times (where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and for each iteration, it takes input, splits it into components, and converts each component into an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `cubes` will depend on the inputs provided during execution. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on input.**
