According to the code, the loop iterates over the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 3 lists in `cubes`, and we need to adjust the `cube` and the loop variable accordingly.

At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, and `cube` is the second cube in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 3 lists, and `cube` should be the third cube in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third cube in cubes, and `digits` now contains string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
