The `print(max_num)` statement outputs the value of `max_num`. The value of `max_num` is either 0 (if `digits` is empty) or an integer formed by the maximum digits in `digits`. Since `max_num` is being printed, the output state will reflect its current value without changing any other variables. 

Output State: **`max_num` is either 0 or an integer formed by the maximum digits in `digits`**
