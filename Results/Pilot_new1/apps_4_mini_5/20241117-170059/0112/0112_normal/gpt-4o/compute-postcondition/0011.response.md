The value of `used_cubes[i]` is assigned `True`. Since `i` is 1 and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` (where `n` is greater than 1), the second element of the list (index 1) is now set to `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `found`, and `digit`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `used_cubes` has its second element set to True, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `used_cubes` has its second element set to True, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`**
