Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` remains True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, the values of `used_cubes` and `found` remain unchanged.***
