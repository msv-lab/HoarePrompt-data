Output State: **If `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` lists and the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` is False, then `used_cubes` will have the corresponding index set to True, and `found` will be True. If `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists or all corresponding `used_cubes[i]` are already True, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. If `n` is 1, the loop will execute at most once; if `n` is 2, it will execute at most twice; and if `n` is 3, it will execute at most three times. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop does not execute.**
