The code assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. Given that `i` is 2, the third element of the list `used_cubes` (since indexing starts from 0) will be set to `True`. The values of `n` and `used_cubes` are impacted, where `n` remains greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes` will have its third element changed to `True`. The length of `used_cubes` is still `n`, and the other elements remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes` has its third element set to True**
