According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. For the loop to execute, `digits` must be defined and contain at least one element. Additionally, since `num` is undefined, it must be defined before the loop starts. 

To summarize the necessary adjustments:
1. Ensure `digits` is defined and has at least one element.
2. Define `num` to a suitable value (the specific value isn't provided in the context, but it should be initialized).

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists each containing 6 integers, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length n with all elements set to False, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element**
