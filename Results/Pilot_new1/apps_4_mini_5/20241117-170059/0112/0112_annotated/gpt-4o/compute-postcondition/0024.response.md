Postcondition: ***If `found` is `False`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if `found` is `True`, the state of `used_cubes` is updated to reflect the indices corresponding to the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`, with those indices set to `True`. If `n` is less than 1, no changes occur to any variables, and the function does not execute the loop.***
