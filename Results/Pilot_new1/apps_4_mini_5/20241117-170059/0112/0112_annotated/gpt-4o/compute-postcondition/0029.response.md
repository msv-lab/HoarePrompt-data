According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more digit available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, `n` is at least 1, `digits` has at least one more digit available, and `digit` is the next digit in the list. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, we need to ensure that `digits` still has at least one more digit available after the current `digit`. Therefore, we should adjust `digits` to indicate that it has one less digit available and set `digit` to the next digit in the list. 

State: **`found` is False, `n` is at least 1, `digits` has at least one digit available, `digit` is the next digit in the list**
