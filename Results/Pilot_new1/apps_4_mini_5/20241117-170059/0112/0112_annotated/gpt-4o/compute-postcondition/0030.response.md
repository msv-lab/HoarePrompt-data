Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, the loop will iterate through each digit in `digits`. If a digit is found in any of the `cube_faces` and the corresponding cube has not been used, the respective index in `used_cubes` will be set to `True`. If a digit cannot be matched to any available cube, the function will return `False`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all `False`). If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.**
