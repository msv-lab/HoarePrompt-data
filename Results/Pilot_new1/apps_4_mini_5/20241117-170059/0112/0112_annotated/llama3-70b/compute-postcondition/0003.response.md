According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list (i.e., it should not be empty). Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it implies that `cubes` can have up to 3 lists, but it must have at least 1 for the loop to run. 

At the end of the last iteration, `cube` will hold the last list from `cubes`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `cubes` must have at least 1 list, and `cube` should be the first list in `cubes` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
