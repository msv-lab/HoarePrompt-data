The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on an integer `n`, which is constrained to be between 1 and 3, and it expects each cube to be represented by a list of 6 integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9. The function's output is determined by the values of these cubes. 

Since the specific output of the function based on the values of `n` and the cube representations was not provided, we cannot detail the exact return values. However, we can summarize the input constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of 6 integers for each cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) and processes these cubes accordingly.**
