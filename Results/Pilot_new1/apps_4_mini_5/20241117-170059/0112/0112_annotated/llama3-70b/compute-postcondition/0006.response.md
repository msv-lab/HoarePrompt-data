The `digits` variable is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, the specific integers in `cube` will be converted to strings and added to `digits`. The initial state indicates that `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, but this does not directly affect the update of `digits`. The output state will reflect the updated `digits` containing the string representations of the integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube**
