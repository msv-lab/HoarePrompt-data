The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each `digit` in the `cube` list. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the `cube` will contain a certain number of integers (at least one) based on the structure of the `cubes` list. 

The previous value of `digits` is an empty set. After executing the code, `digits` will contain the string representations of the integers found in `cube`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to include the string representations of the integers in `cube`**
