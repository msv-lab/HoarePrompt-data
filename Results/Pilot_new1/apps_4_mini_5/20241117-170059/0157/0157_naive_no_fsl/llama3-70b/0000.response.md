Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
   - The number of lemons that can be used is limited by the number of apples (since each lemon requires 2 apples) and pears (since each lemon requires 4 pears). 
   - The expression `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available quantities of apples and pears.

3. **Total Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`. This correctly gives the total number of fruits used.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where Nikolay cannot make any compote (e.g., when he has fewer than the required fruits). For example, if `a = 2`, `b = 3`, and `c = 2`, the calculation will yield `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`, resulting in an output of `0`, which is correct.

Since the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement for all potential cases, it is deemed correct.
