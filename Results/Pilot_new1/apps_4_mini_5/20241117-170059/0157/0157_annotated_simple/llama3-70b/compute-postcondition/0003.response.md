The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, as well as the calculated value of `min_lemon`. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
