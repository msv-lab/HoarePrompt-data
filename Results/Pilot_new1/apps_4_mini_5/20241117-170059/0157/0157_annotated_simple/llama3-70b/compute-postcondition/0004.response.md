To determine the output state, we first need to evaluate the expression for `min_lemon` based on the initial state and then calculate the result of the print statement.

1. `min_lemon` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This means we take the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`.
2. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be simplified:
   - This expression can be rewritten as `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

Therefore, the output state will include the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `min_lemon`, as well as the result of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and the printed result is min_lemon * 7**
