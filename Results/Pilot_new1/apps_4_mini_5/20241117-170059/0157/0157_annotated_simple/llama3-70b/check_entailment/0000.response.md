To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code closely.

### Problem Breakdown:
Nikolay has:
- `a` lemons
- `b` apples
- `c` pears

The recipe requires:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

To find out how many complete sets of this ratio can be made, we need to establish the limiting factor among the fruits:
- The maximum number of complete sets of lemons we can use is `a`.
- The maximum number of complete sets of apples we can use is `b // 2`.
- The maximum number of complete sets of pears we can use is `c // 4`.

The minimum of these three values will determine how many complete sets can be created.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input representing the counts of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Calculating Minimum Sets**: The line `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the provided counts.
3. **Output Calculation**: The line `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)` computes the total number of fruits used in the compote, which is correctly calculated as:
   - `min_lemon` lemons
   - `min_lemon * 2` apples
   - `min_lemon * 4` pears

### Edge Cases:
- If any of the fruits are insufficient to make even one complete set (e.g., `a = 0`, `b = 0`, or `c = 0`), the output will be `0`, which is correct as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It accurately calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used based on the given ratios and handles edge cases appropriately.

Thus, after careful analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
