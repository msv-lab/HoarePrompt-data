To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description together.

### Problem Description Recap
Nikolay has:
- `a` lemons
- `b` apples
- `c` pears

The required ratio for making the compote is:
- For every 1 lemon, there should be 2 apples and 4 pears.

### Required Output
The task is to compute the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote based on the given quantities.

### Annotations Review
The annotations provided in the code seem to correctly describe the logic:
- The program reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
- It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
  - The number of lemons available (`a`)
  - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`)
  - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`)
- Then it calculates the total fruits used as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.
- Finally, it prints the total.

### Code Analysis
The code seems logically sound for the following reasons:
1. It correctly computes how many complete sets of the fruit ratio can be made based on the available fruits.
2. It accounts for the fact that all fruits must be whole, as it uses integer division.
3. The final output correctly sums the total number of fruits used.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider edge cases to ensure the program handles all scenarios correctly:
- **Case with minimum inputs**: 
  - Input: `1`, `1`, `1` (1 lemon, 1 apple, 1 pear)
  - Output should be `0` since we can't create any compote.
  
- **Case where one fruit is insufficient**:
  - Input: `1`, `3`, `2` (1 lemon, 3 apples, 2 pears)
  - Output should be `0` since we don't have enough pears (need 4 for 1 lemon).
  
- **Case with sufficient fruits**:
  - Input: `3`, `6`, `12` (3 lemons, 6 apples, 12 pears)
  - Output should be `21` since we can use all fruits in the ratio.

- **Case with excess fruits**:
  - Input: `10`, `20`, `40` (10 lemons, 20 apples, 40 pears)
  - Output should be `70` since we can use 10 lemons, 20 apples, and 40 pears.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles all specified cases correctly and outputs the expected results.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
