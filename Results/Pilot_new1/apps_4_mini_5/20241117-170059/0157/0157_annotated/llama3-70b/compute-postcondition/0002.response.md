The value of `c` is assigned a new value from `int(input())`, which accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The previous value of `c` is unknown but it is stated to be a positive integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer**
