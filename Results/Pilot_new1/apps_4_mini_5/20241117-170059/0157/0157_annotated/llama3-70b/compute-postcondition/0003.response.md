The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, so the specific values will determine the outcome. Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we can only express the output state in a general form.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
