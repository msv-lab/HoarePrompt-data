The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged, and `c` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `b` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
