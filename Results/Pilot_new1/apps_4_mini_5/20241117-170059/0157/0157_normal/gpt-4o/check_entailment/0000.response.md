To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). The recipe requires fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). The task is to compute the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote.

### Program Analysis:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
  
2. **Calculation of Maximum Lemons**:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`: This line correctly computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears. It ensures that for each lemon, there are enough apples (2 per lemon) and pears (4 per lemon).

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`: This computes the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons that can be used.

4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of fruits.

### Edge Cases:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` is 0, the program would not handle it correctly since all inputs are expected to be positive integers (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000). However, the problem description states that the input will always be positive integers, so this edge case does not apply here.
- If `b` is less than 2 or `c` is less than 4, the program should correctly return 0 since it cannot make any compote. The logic correctly captures this scenario through the `min` function.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints indicate that the function calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the available fruits and computes the total number of fruits used accordingly. It also mentions that the function does not return any values and only prints the result, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and handles the specified cases correctly. There are no edge cases that would cause the program to fail based on the provided constraints. The output hints align with the program's functionality.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly computes the total number of fruits that can be used based on the defined ratios, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
