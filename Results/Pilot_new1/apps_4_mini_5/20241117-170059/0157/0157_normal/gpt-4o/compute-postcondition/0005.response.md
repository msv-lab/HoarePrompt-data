To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the effect of the code.

1. The initial state includes the following variables:
   - `a`: an input integer
   - `b`: an input integer
   - `c`: an input integer
   - `max_lemons`: calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
   - `total_fruits`: calculated as `max_lemons * 7`

2. The code snippet `print(total_fruits)` outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since `total_fruits` is derived from the previous calculations involving `max_lemons`, which in turn depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their input values.
- `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- `total_fruits` is computed as `max_lemons * 7`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the computed `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
