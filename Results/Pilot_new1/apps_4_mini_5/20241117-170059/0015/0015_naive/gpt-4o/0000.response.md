To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code against the requirements.

The problem states that we need to check if a number `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence that starts with `a` and has a common difference of `c`. The sequence can be represented as:

- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_2 = a + c \)
- \( s_3 = a + 2c \)
- ...

The condition for `b` to be part of this sequence is that there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \). This can be rearranged to:

\[ b = a + (i - 1)c \]
or equivalently,
\[ (b - a) = (i - 1)c \]

From this, we can derive:

1. If `b` is equal to `a`, we should return "YES".
2. If `c` is 0, the sequence consists of only the number `a`. So, if `b` is not equal to `a`, we should return "NO".
3. If `c` is not 0, we check if `(b - a) % c == 0` to ensure that `b` can be reached by some integer multiple of `c` added to `a`. Additionally, we need to ensure that \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative which means `b` must not be less than `a` if `c` is positive.

Now, let's analyze the provided code:

```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Case when `b == a`:** Correctly outputs "YES".
2. **Case when `c == 0`:** Correctly outputs "NO" if `b` is not equal to `a`.
3. **Case when `c != 0`:** 
   - The condition `(b - a) % c == 0` checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by stepping through the sequence.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that if `c` is positive, `b` must be greater than or equal to `a`, and if `c` is negative, `b` must be less than or equal to `a`.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- If `c` is negative and `b` is greater than `a`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" since it checks for non-negativity of `(b - a) / c`, which would be negative in this case. 

### Example Case for Failure:

Consider the case where:
- Input: `a = 5`, `b = 10`, `c = -2`
- The expected behavior is that the sequence would be `5, 3, 1, -1, ...` and `10` is not in this sequence. However, the program would output "NO" because `(10 - 5) / -2 = -2.5`, which is negative, even though `b` is not part of the sequence.

Thus, the program fails for this edge case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle the case where `c` is negative and `b` is greater than `a`, leading to incorrect output in such scenarios.
