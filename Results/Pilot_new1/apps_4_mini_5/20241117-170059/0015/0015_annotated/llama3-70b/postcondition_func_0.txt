The function reads three integers from user input: `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, or 'NO' if they are not. If `c` is not 0, it checks whether the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and whether the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, printing 'YES' if both conditions are met, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints results based on the conditions checked.
