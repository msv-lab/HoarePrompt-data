Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'.***
