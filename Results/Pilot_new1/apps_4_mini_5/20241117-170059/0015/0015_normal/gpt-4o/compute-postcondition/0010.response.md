The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change, and the conditions regarding their values remain true. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has been executed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new input integers. `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0; 'NO' has been printed.**
