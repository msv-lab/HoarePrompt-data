Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and whether the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**
