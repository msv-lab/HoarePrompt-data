To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if a favorite integer `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence defined by its first element `a` and a common difference `c`. The sequence is described as:
- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \)

We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **First Condition**: `if b == a:`  
   - This correctly checks if `b` is the first element of the sequence.

2. **Second Condition**: `elif c == 0:`  
   - If `c` is 0, the sequence does not progress (remains constant at `a`). The program correctly returns 'NO' unless `b` equals `a`, which is already handled.

3. **Third Condition**: `elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:`  
   - This checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c`, and whether the quotient is non-negative. This is essential because it ensures that `b` can be reached by moving forward in the sequence (i.e., `i` must be positive).

4. **Else Statement**: If none of the above conditions are met, it returns 'NO'.

### Edge Cases:
- When `c` is negative: The program should still work as it checks if the difference is divisible by `c` and if the quotient is non-negative. However, if `b < a` and `c < 0`, it should return 'YES'.
- When `c` is positive: The conditions should hold as expected.
- When `a`, `b`, and `c` are at their limits, e.g., `a = -10^9`, `b = 10^9`, `c = 1`: The program should still function correctly.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints summarize the logic of the program correctly:
- It states that the function prints 'YES' if `b` is equal to `a`.
- If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO' unless `b` is equal to `a`.
- If `c` is not 0, it checks the divisibility and non-negativity of the quotient.

Since the output hints align with the actual code and the logic appears sound, we can conclude that the code handles all specified cases correctly.

### Final Assessment:
After reviewing the logic and ensuring that all edge cases are appropriately handled, the program adheres to the problem description without any omissions or errors.

Correctness: **True**.
