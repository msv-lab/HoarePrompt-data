Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes all cases where `c` can be positive or negative, ensuring the conditions regarding divisibility and the sign of the quotient are properly handled.***
