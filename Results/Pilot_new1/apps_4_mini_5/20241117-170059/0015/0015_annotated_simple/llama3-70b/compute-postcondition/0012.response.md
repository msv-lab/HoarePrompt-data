Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers with `c` not equal to 0. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and non-negative. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or it is negative.***
