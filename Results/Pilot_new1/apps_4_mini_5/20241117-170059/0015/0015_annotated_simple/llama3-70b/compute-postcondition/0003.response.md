The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change due to the print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; `c` is 0; `a` is equal to `b`, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers; `c` is 0; `a` is equal to `b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
