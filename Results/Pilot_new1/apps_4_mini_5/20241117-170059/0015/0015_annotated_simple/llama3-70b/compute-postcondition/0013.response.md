Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers. If `c` equals 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is a non-negative multiple of `c`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This includes the edge cases where `a` equals `b` and `c` is zero, as well as scenarios where the difference is negative or not a multiple of `c`.***
