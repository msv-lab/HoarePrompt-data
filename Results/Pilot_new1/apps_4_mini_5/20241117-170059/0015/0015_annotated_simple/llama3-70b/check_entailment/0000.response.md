To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze it based on the problem description and the annotated code.

The problem requires us to check if a number `b` appears in a sequence that starts with `a` and has a common difference of `c`. The sequence can be mathematically expressed as:

- If `c` is 0, the sequence is constant, and it will be equal to `a` for all terms. Therefore, `b` can only be in the sequence if `a == b`.
- If `c` is not 0, we need to check if `b` can be expressed in the form of `a + n*c` for some non-negative integer `n`. This translates to checking if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.

The annotated program correctly implements this logic:

1. It checks if `c` is 0:
   - If `c` is 0, it checks if `a == b` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
  
2. If `c` is not 0, it checks:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0` to ensure that the difference is a multiple of `c`.
   - If `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` a non-negative number of times.

Now, let’s evaluate the potential edge cases:

- **Case 1**: When `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 0`. The output should be "YES" since `a` equals `b`.
- **Case 2**: When `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = 3`. The sequence will be 1, 4, 7, ... and the output should be "YES".
- **Case 3**: When `a = 1`, `b = -4`, and `c = 5`. The sequence will be 1, 6, 11, ... and the output should be "NO".
- **Case 4**: When `a = 0`, `b = 60`, and `c = 50`. The sequence will be 0, 50, 100, ... and the output should be "NO".

All these cases are correctly handled by the program.

Now, let’s consider a potential edge case where `c` is negative:

- **Case 5**: When `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = -5`. The sequence will be 10, 5, 0, -5, ... Here, `b` is indeed in the sequence. The program will correctly identify this as `(5 - 10) % -5 == 0` and `(5 - 10) / -5 >= 0`, yielding "YES".

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and adheres to the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
