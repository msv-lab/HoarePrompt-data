Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated to `shares + r // s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop or if statement is exited, leaving `shares` unchanged at 0, `i` remains 0, and `r` retains its original value.***
