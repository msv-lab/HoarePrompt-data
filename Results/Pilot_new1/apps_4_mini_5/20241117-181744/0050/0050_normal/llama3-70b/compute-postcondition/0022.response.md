Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, and `i` is 2. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[2]`, then `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[2])` and `r` is updated to `r % s[2]`. If `r` is less than `s[2]`, then `shares` remains unchanged at 0 and `r` retains its original value. In either case, if the condition is not met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
