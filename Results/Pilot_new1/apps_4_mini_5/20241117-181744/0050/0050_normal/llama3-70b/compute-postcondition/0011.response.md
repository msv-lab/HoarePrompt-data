The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0, and `r` is less than `s[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
