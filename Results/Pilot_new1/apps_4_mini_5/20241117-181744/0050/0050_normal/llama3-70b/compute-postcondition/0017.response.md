Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `i` is 1, and `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[1])` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, `shares` remains unchanged at 0, and `r` retains its original value, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
