Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0, and if `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
