The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned based on the input provided by the user, where `map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into separate values, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `r`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, as they will be replaced by the new input values. Other variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` and `b` are unaffected**.
