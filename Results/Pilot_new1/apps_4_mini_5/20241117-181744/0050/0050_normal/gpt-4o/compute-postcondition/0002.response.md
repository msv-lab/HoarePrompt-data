The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input integers provided as a space-separated string. The initial values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of input integers; `b` is a list of input integers**
