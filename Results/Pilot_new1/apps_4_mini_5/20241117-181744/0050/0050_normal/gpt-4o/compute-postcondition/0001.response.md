The code assigns a list of integers to `s` by taking input from the user, splitting it into individual string components, converting each to an integer, and mapping them into a list. The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, and their values remain unchanged. The variable `b` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as the new list assigned to `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of input integers; `b` is unaffected**
