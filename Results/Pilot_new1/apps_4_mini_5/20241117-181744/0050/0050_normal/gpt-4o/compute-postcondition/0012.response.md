Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of input integers; `b` is a list of input integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, and the function prints `total_bourles`, which is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. This covers the cases where `r` is less than, equal to, or greater than `min_buy_price`, ensuring that all possible scenarios regarding the relationship between buying and selling prices are accounted for.***
