To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `r` is an input integer
- `s` is a list of input integers
- `b` is a list of input integers
- `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`
- `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`
- `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`
- `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`
- `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`

The code snippet `print(total_bourles)` outputs the value of `total_bourles`, but does not change any of the variables.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of the variables as they were before the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`, `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`**
