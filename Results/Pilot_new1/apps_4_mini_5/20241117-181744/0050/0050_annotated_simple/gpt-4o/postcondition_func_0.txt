The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `n` is the number of buy prices, `m` is the number of sell prices, and `r` is the amount of bourles available. It also accepts two lists of integers: `s`, which contains `n` buy prices, and `b`, which contains `m` sell prices. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates how many shares can be bought with `r` using the minimum buy price, determines the remaining bourles after buying the shares, and calculates the total bourles after selling those shares at the maximum sell price, which it then prints. The function handles the case where no shares can be sold by directly printing `r` when the sell price is less than or equal to the buy price.
