Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `shares` remains unchanged at 0 and `r` retains its original value, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `shares` will be updated only if `r` can be divided by `s[i]`, otherwise, the loop will terminate without any changes to `shares` or `r`.***
