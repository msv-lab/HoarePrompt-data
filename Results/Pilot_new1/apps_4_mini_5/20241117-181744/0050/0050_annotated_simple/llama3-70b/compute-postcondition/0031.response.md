Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, and `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
