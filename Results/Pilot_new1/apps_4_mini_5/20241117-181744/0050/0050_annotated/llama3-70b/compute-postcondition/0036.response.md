Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as the smallest value in `s`, and `i` is less than `m`. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
