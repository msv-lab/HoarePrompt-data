Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers; `s` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as `r % min_buy_price`, and prints `total_bourles`, which is equal to `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. Additionally, the function handles edge cases where `s` or `b` may be empty, resulting in undefined `min_buy_price` or `max_sell_price`, which should be addressed before this logic is applied.***
