To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of how the program calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x.

The program takes two integers x and y as input, where \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The logic in the program is as follows:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reduce the side length from x to y while ensuring that at every step, the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the lengths of the sides must still form a valid triangle).

2. **Operations Allowed**: In one second, the program can modify one side of the triangle. The triangle must remain non-degenerate, meaning the lengths of the sides must always satisfy the triangle inequality.

3. **Calculation Logic**: The program computes the number of seconds required using the formula:
   \[
   \text{seconds} = \frac{x - y}{2} + (x - y) \mod 2
   \]
   This formula attempts to calculate how many side lengths need to be reduced in a way that always maintains the triangle's validity.

### Potential Issues:
- The formula does not account for the fact that when reducing the side lengths, all three sides must be modified to maintain the triangle's integrity. For example, if \(x = 5\) and \(y = 3\):
  - The program would compute \((5 - 3) // 2 + (5 - 3) \mod 2 = 1 + 0 = 1\).
  - However, to go from (5, 5, 5) to (3, 3, 3), it requires 2 seconds: (5, 5, 5) → (5, 5, 4) → (3, 3, 3).
  
### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly account for the necessary adjustments to all three sides of the triangle. It fails to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate during the transition from \(x\) to \(y\).

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
