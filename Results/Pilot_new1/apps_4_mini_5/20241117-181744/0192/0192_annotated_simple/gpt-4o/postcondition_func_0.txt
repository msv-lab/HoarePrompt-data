The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input, where it is assumed that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints the result of the expression \((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) \% 2\), which effectively computes the ceiling of the half of the difference between `x` and `y`. The function does not return any value but only prints the result.
