The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints, `x` is greater than `y`, so `abs(x - y)` simplifies to `x - y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged after the execution of this code.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the output is `x - y`**
