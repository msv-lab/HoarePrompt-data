The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of steps needed to make `x` equal to `y` by decrementing `x` and incrementing `y`. The first part, `(x - y) // 2`, gives the number of full pairs of decrements and increments, while the second part, `(x - y) % 2`, accounts for any remaining difference if `x - y` is odd. Since `x` and `y` are user inputs satisfying `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the values of `x` and `y` will determine the exact result.

However, without specific values for `x` and `y`, I can only describe the output state in general terms. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` and `y` are user-defined integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is calculated as (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2.**
