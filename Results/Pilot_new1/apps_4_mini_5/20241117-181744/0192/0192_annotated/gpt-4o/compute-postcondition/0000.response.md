The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user, which will be two integers separated by a space. The constraints given are that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but without specific input values, we cannot determine the exact values of `x` and `y`. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `x` and `y` are now assigned new integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned new integer values based on user input, satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
