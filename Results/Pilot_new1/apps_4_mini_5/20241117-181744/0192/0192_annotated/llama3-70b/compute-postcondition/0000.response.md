The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the input split into two integers. The previous conditions state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now integers based on the input values, while maintaining the initial constraints.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than y, `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
