Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. The function assumes that the integers satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000, but does not handle cases where the input does not meet these constraints. **
