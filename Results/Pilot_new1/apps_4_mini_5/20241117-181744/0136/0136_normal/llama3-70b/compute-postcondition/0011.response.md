The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to \(10^6\) digits. The function processes these inputs and returns the sum of the two integers, also represented as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b` (non-negative integers as strings), and returns their sum as a string.**
