The value of `b` is assigned the result of `input().lstrip('0')`, which removes any leading zeroes from the input string. The variable `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` after leading zeroes have been stripped. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes**
