The `data` variable is assigned the result of `input().split()`, where `input()` accepts a string of space-separated values and `split()` divides that string into a list of individual components. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `data` now holds the split components of the input string.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings; `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces.**
