Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the first element in `data` without leading zeros, and if `a` was originally empty, it is now '0'; `b` is a string that retains its original value, and the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, then if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'; otherwise, if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='.***
