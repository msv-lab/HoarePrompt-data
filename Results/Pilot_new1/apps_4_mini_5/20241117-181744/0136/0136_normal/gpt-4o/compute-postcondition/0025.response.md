Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the first element in `data` without leading zeros, and if `a` was originally empty, it is now '0'; `b` is '0' if it was originally empty, otherwise it retains its original value. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is determined by lexicographical comparison: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if they are equal, the output is '='.***
