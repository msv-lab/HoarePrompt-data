The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `data[1]` is not specified, but since `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` will either be the same as `data[1]` if there are no leading zeros or a modified version of it without leading zeros. The other variable `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `a` and the new value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the first element in `data` without leading zeros; `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` without leading zeros**
