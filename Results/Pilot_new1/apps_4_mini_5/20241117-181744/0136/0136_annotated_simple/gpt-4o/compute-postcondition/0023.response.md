Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string values without leading zeros, where `a` is '0' if initially empty, and `b` is '0' if initially empty. Both strings have the same length. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All cases are covered, including when either string is empty, which is treated as '0'.***
