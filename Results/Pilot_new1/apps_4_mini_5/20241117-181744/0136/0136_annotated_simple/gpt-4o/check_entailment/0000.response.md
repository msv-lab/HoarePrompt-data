To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the comments.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input().split()` to read the two numbers, which is appropriate given the problem description. However, we need to ensure that the input handling can deal with very large integers, up to \(10^6\) digits.
  
2. **Leading Zeros**: The program correctly strips leading zeros using `lstrip('0')`. If the resulting string is empty (which means the original number was zero), it sets the string to `'0'`.

3. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of the two strings:
   - If `len(a) < len(b)`, it prints `<`.
   - If `len(a) > len(b)`, it prints `>`.
   - If they are of equal length, it proceeds to lexicographical comparison.

4. **Lexicographical Comparison**: For strings of the same length, it compares the strings directly:
   - If `a < b`, it prints `<`.
   - If `a > b`, it prints `>`.
   - If they are equal, it prints `=`.

### Edge Cases
The program seems to handle leading zeros and the case where both numbers are zero correctly. However, there is one potential issue:

- **Empty Input Handling**: The program does not explicitly handle the case where no input is provided. If the input is empty, it will throw an error when trying to access `data[0]` and `data[1]`. This is a critical edge case that violates the problem description, which states that the inputs should be non-negative integers, but does not specify what to do if no input is given at all.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not handle the case of empty input properly, it can lead to runtime errors, which means it does not fulfill the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation
The program fails to handle the case where no input is provided, which can lead to an IndexError when trying to access elements of `data`. This is a clear violation of the requirement that the program should work for all potential cases, thus making it incorrect.
