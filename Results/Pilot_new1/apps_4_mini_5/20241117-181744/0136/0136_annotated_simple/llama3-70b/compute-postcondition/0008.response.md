The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '>'. The values of `a` and `b` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string without leading zeroes; the strings `a` and `b` are not equal; `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and the output is '>'**
