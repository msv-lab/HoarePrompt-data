Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, and `b` is a string without leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. This covers all cases of comparison between the two strings.***
