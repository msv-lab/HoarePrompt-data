Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), and `b` retains its original value from `data[1]` with the same length as `a`. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. Thus, the output reflects the lexicographical comparison of `a` and `b`, covering all possible cases based on their values.***
