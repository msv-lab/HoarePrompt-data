Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), `b` retains its original value from `data[1]`, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. The string `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. The list `data` remains unchanged.***
