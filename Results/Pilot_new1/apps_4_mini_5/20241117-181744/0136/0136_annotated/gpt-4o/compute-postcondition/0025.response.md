Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), and `b` retains its original value from `data[1]` (or '0' if `b` was originally empty). If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, then if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All cases are covered, including the edge case where `a` and `b` are equal, and the list `data` remains unchanged.***
