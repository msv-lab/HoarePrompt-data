The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to 10^6 digits. The function processes these string representations of integers and returns the result of an operation involving `a` and `b`. However, the specific operation or output is not provided in the constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, which can have leading zeroes and can be very large (up to 10^6 digits). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and may contain leading zeroes, with each string having up to 10^6 digits.**
