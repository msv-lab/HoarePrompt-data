The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is now `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is modified at index `i` (which is `k - 3`) by incrementing it by 1, and `i` is `k - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
