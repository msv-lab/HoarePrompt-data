Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is now `n - d * min_sum - 2`, and `sequence` is modified at index `i` (which is `k - 3`) by incrementing it by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the code continues executing without breaking.***
