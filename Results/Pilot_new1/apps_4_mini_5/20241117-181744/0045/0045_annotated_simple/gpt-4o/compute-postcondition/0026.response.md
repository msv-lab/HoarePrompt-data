The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, the function calculates `min_sum` as k * (k + 1) // 2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum exceeds the available value `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return a value, implying that further processing may occur beyond this fragment.

In Case 2, the function returns a modified sequence based on the values of remainder and k, or the original sequence [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd] if the conditions for modification are not met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, return -1 if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`, and potentially return a modified sequence or the original sequence based on specific conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, returns -1 if the minimum required sum exceeds n, and may return a modified sequence or the original sequence based on further conditions.**
