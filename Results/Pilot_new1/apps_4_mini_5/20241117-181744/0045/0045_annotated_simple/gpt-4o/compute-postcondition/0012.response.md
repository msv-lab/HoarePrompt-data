The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, which is a positive integer, so after execution, `remainder` will be `n - d * min_sum - 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + 1]`, and `i` is `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + 1]`, and `i` is `k - 1`**.
