The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + 1]`, and `i` is `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
