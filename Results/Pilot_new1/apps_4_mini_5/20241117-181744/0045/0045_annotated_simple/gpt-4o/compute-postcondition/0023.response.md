According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`, which is initialized to `k - 1` and decremented in each iteration until it reaches -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be -1, which means the loop cannot execute again unless `i` is adjusted back to a valid index.

Since `k` is at least 2, `i` would need to be set to `k - 1` to allow the loop to execute one more time. 

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is now `n - d * min_sum - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is k - 1**
