To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and has the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).

2. **Initial Conditions**: The program first calculates the minimum sum needed for the first `k` positive integers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns `-1`, which is correct since it's impossible to create such a sequence.

3. **Calculating the Sequence**: 
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which is the maximum GCD that can be used to scale the sequence of the first `k` integers.
   - It then calculates the `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, which tells us how much more we need to add to reach `n`.

4. **Constructing the Sequence**: The sequence is initially set to `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, which gives us the first `k` multiples of `d`. 
   - The program then attempts to distribute the `remainder` across the sequence by incrementing the last elements of the sequence until the `remainder` is exhausted.

5. **Final Return**: Finally, the program returns the constructed sequence.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n` properly. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program will compute `min_sum = 3`, which is greater than `n`. The program will correctly return `-1`.
- However, if `k = 1` and `n = 1`, the program will return `[1]`, which is valid. But if `k = 2` and `n = 2`, the program will return `-1`, which is also correct since we cannot form a strictly increasing sequence of two positive integers that sum to 2.
- The program correctly handles cases where `n` is exactly the minimum sum required for `k` integers.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum`, the program will return the correct sequence.
- If `k` is very large compared to `n`, the program will correctly return `-1`.

### Conclusion:
I could not find any instance where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. All potential edge cases have been considered, and the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic necessary to create the required sequence or return `-1` when it is not possible, handling all specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.
