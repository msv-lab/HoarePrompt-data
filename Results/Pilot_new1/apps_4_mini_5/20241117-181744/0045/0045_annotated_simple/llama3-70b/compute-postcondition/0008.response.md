The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.**
