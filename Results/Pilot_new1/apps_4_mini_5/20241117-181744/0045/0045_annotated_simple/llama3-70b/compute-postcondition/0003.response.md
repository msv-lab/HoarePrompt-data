According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0, which means the loop cannot execute again. For the loop to be executed one more time, `b` must be adjusted to be non-zero. Therefore, we need to change `b` to any non-zero value.

State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is 1**
