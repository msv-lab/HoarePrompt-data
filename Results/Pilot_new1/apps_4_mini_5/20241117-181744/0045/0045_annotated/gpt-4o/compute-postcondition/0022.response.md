The variable `remainder` is decremented by 1. The values of the other variables, including `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence[k - 2]`, and `sequence[i]`, are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
