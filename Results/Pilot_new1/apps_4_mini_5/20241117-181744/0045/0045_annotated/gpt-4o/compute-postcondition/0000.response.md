The value of `min_sum` is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^10, `min_sum` will be assigned the value of the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` do not affect each other, and only `min_sum` is affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `min_sum` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
