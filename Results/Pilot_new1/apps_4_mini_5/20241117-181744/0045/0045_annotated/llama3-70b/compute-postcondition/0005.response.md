According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (or positive), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the positive value resulting from `a % b`. Since `a` is greater than `b`, the remainder when `a` is divided by `b` will also be positive, ensuring that `b` is still positive. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the current state for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is positive, `k` is positive, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the positive value resulting from `a % b`, and `a` is greater than `b`**
