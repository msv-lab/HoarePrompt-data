According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 0 after this assignment.

Since `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, it will be non-zero as long as `a` is not a multiple of `b`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a % b` is not equal to 0. 

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers, we do not need to adjust them, but we need to ensure that `a` is not a multiple of `b` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is positive, `k` is positive, `a` is not a multiple of b**
