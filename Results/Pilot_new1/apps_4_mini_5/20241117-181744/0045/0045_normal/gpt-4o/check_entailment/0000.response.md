To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code functionality step by step.

### Problem Description:
1. Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that:
   - Their sum equals `n`.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximal.
2. If it's impossible to form such a sequence, return `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program first calculates the minimum required sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns `-1`, indicating that forming the required sum is impossible.
3. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, it calculates how many complete sets of this minimum sum can be formed (`d = n // min_sum`).
4. The sequence is initialized with multiples of `d` and then the program distributes any remaining value to the last elements of the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case where `k` is very large relative to `n`:** If `k` is larger than `n`, then `min_sum` will exceed `n`, and the program will correctly return `-1`.
- **Case where `n` is exactly `min_sum`:** The program should return the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]` which is correct.
- **Case where `n` is much larger than `min_sum`:** The program should correctly generate a sequence where the GCD is maximized.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the function's behavior correctly, indicating that:
- The function calculates the minimum sum needed.
- It checks if forming the sequence is possible.
- It constructs the sequence and adjusts it based on any remainder.

### Validation Against Output Hints:
The output hints align with the code's logic. The program correctly identifies when it's impossible to form a sequence and constructs the sequence appropriately when possible.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the code handles the requirements correctly for all provided cases. The logic for creating the sequence and adjusting for any remainder is sound.

Therefore, I cannot find any edge cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
