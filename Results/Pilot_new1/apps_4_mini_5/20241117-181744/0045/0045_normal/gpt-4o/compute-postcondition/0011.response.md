The code `sequence[i] += 1` increments the value at index `i` of the `sequence` list by 1. The variables `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value at `sequence[i]` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.**
