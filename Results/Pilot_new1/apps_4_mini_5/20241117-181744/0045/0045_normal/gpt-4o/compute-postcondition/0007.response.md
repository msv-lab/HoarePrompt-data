According to the code, the for loop executes from `i = k - 1` down to `i = 0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1 (since `k` is a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied). 

At the start of the loop, `i` will take the value of `k - 1`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `k - 1` will be non-negative, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. 

The key states that need to be considered are:
- `i` should be initialized to `k - 1`, which is valid as long as `k` is greater than 0.
- The loop will iterate down to `0`, so `i` will eventually reach `0`.

There are no additional adjustments needed for the other variables (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`) as they do not affect the execution of the loop directly.

Thus, the necessary state adjustments are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements calculated from `d`, `i` is `k - 1`**
