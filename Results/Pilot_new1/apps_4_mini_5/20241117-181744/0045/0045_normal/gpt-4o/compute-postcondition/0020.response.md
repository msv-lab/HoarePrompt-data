Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that a certain condition has been met. If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the program continues executing without breaking.***
