To calculate the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

- The initial state provides:
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `k` is a positive integer.
  - `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers.
  - `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, which represents how many times `min_sum` fits into `n`.

Next, we evaluate the code snippet:
```
remainder = n - d * min_sum
```
This line calculates the `remainder` by subtracting the total value of `d * min_sum` from `n`.

The impact of the code:
- `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`.
- The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and `d`) remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state after executing the code reflects the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and introduces the new variable `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.**
