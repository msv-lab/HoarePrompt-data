The variable `remainder` is decreased by 1. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the previous state of `remainder` is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder` only.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**
