The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying its previous value by `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `numerator` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `denominator` while noting that `i` and `k` remain the same.

Output State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, and `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD**
