The code assigns the value `10 ** 6 + 3` to the variable `MOD`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The value of `MOD` becomes `1000003`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `k`, and the newly assigned value of `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003**
