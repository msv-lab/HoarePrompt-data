The value of `total_days` is assigned the result of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). The initial state of `n` is a positive integer within the range of \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\). The value of `total_days` will be \(2^n\).

Since there is no output or return specified in the code snippet, the output state will reflect the assignment of `total_days`. The other variable `k` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
