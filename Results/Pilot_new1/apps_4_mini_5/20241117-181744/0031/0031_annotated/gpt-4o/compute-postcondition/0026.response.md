The value of `B` is updated to `B // g`. The value of `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`, but since we do not know the specific value of `g`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `B`. The previous values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `A`, and `g` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `p_no_shared` is either 1 or the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1 modulo MOD; `p_total` is the value of denominator; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is updated to B // g; `g` is the value returned by func_1(A, B).
