In this code snippet, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The initial values of the affected variables are as follows:

- `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\).
- `denominator` is equal to \(2^n\).

Now, we perform the calculation for the new value of `denominator`:

\[
\text{new denominator} = \text{denominator} \times \text{total_days} = 2^n \times 2^n = 2^{2n}
\]

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2^{2n}, `i` is 1**
