The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The value of `denominator` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1) \cdots (2^n - (k - 1))) \% MOD\) if `k` > 0 or 1 if `k` = 0; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1) \cdots (2^n - (k - 1))) \% MOD\) if `k` > 0 or 1 if `k` = 0; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**
