The variable `p_shared` is assigned the value of `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_no_shared` can either be \((2^n \cdot (2^n - 1) \cdots (2^n - (k - 1))) \% MOD\) if `k` > 0 or 1 if `k` = 0. Therefore, depending on the value of `k`, the calculation for `p_shared` will vary.

- If `k` > 0, then:
  - `p_no_shared` will have a specific value based on the formula provided.
  - `p_shared` will be calculated as `(denominator - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.

- If `k` = 0:
  - `p_no_shared` will be 1.
  - `p_shared` will be calculated as `(denominator - 1 + MOD) % MOD`.

In both cases, `p_shared` will be determined based on the values of `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, and `MOD`.

Output State: **`p_shared` is calculated based on the value of `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, and `MOD`.**
