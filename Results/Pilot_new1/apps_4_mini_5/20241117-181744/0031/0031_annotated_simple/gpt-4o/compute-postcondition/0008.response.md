According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variables `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not affect the execution of the loop directly, but they are part of the overall program state. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `k - 1`. For the loop to be executed, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
