The variable `denominator` is assigned the value of 1. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so `n` remains an integer, `k` remains an integer, `total_days` is still \(2^n\), and `numerator` remains 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
