The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which is 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^18, the value of `total_days` will be a very large number, specifically 2 raised to that power. The value of `k` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state includes the value of `total_days` calculated as `2 ** n` and retains the values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
