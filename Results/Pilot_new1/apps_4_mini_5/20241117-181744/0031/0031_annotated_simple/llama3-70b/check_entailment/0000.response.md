To determine the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
        
    # State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numerator` is equal to the product of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days` raised to the power of `k`.
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)
    # The program returns the remainder of 'numerator' when divided by 1000003 and the remainder of 'denominator' when divided by 1000003
```

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people have the same birthday, given there are `2^n` possible birthdays. The answer should be given in the form of an irreducible fraction `A/B`, and both `A` and `B` should be returned modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Key Points
1. **Total Days Calculation**: The program calculates `total_days` as `2 ** n`, which is correct.
2. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**: The numerator is calculated by multiplying the decreasing number of available days for each person added, while the denominator is simply `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. This part correctly implements the logic for calculating the probability of unique birthdays.
3. **GCD Reduction**: The program computes the GCD of the numerator and denominator to reduce the fraction to its irreducible form, which is also correct.
4. **Modulo Operation**: The final values of `A` and `B` are returned modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Issues
1. **Handling of Large `k`**: The loop runs `k` times, which can be extremely large (up to `10^18`). This could lead to performance issues or integer overflow in practical implementation, although Python handles large integers natively.
2. **Guaranteed Collision**: If `k > 2^n`, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is 1 (i.e., `A = 1`, `B = 1`). The program does not handle this case explicitly.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The code uses modulo after reducing the fraction, which is correct. However, it doesn't check if the numerator and denominator are already coprime before the modulo operation.

### Example Cases
- For the input `n = 1, k = 3` (2 days, 3 people), the output should be `1 1` (probability 1). The code may not handle this correctly since it does not check if `k > total_days`.
- For `n = 3, k = 2`, it should return `1 8`, which the program calculates correctly.
- For `n = 4, k = 3`, it should return `23 128`, which the program also calculates correctly.

### Conclusion
The program fails to account for the scenario where `k > 2^n`, which is a critical edge case. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
