To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

1. The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which means it is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`.
2. The value of `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). This means that `total_days` will be a very large number since \(2^{10^{18}}\) is an extremely large value.
3. The variable `k` is not affected by this operation, so its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated value of `total_days` based on the provided `n`, while also acknowledging that `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 ** n**
