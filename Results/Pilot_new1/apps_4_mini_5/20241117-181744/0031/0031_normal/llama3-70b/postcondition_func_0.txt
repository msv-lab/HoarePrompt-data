The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the numerator and denominator based on the total number of days (2 raised to the power of `n`), and returns the remainders of the simplified numerator and denominator when divided by 1000003. It handles the case where `k` is greater than `total_days` by resulting in a numerator of zero, thus returning (0, denominator % 1000003).
