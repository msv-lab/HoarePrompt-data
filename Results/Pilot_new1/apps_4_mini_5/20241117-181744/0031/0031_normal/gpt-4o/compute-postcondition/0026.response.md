The code `B //= g` performs an integer division of `B` by `g`, updating the value of `B` to the result of this division. The previous value of `B` is `p_total`, and `g` is the result of `func_1(A, B)`. The specific values of `A`, `B`, and `g` are not provided, so we can only describe the relationship between them.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the result of func_1(A, B); `B` is now updated to B // g.**
