According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting with `i` at 0. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will indeed execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `k`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `i` should start at 0, and `k` should remain as defined.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
