To evaluate the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Review:
The task is to calculate the probability that at least two people share the same birthday among `2^n` days when interviewing `k` people. The output must be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) and printed modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Code Review:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The function first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If it is, it prints `(1, 1)` because it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the probability of no shared birthdays using a combinatorial approach, which is correct.
   - The numerator and denominator are calculated correctly, and the final values of `A` and `B` are reduced using the GCD.
   - The results are printed modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not handle the scenario where `k` is less than 2, which is outside the constraints but could be a potential edge case if inputs were not properly validated.
- The function does not explicitly handle inputs where `n` or `k` are negative or zero, although constraints state \( 1 \leq n \) and \( 2 \leq k \).
- The code assumes valid inputs as per the constraints provided. If inputs were to violate these constraints, the function would not behave as expected.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints describe the functionality of both functions accurately. They confirm that:
- The GCD function correctly computes the GCD.
- The probability calculation function handles the cases where `k` is greater than `2^n` correctly by outputting `(1, 1)`.
- The hints do not indicate any missing logic or edge cases that the code fails to handle.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the output hints, the code appears to correctly implement the problem description for the valid input ranges specified. There are no indications that the code fails to handle any potential cases as long as inputs are within the defined constraints.

Therefore, the assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
