To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` determines the number of days as `2^n`, and `k` is the number of people.

2. **Handling the Case where k > 2^n**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if `k` (the number of people) is greater than `2^n` (the number of days), then at least two people must share a birthday. In this case, it prints `1 1`, which is correct.

3. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - The program initializes `numerator` and `denominator` for calculating the probability that at least two people share a birthday.
   - It iterates `k` times to compute the numerator (the number of favorable outcomes) and the denominator (the total number of outcomes).
   - The probability of no shared birthday is computed as `p_no_shared = numerator / denominator`.
   - The probability of at least one shared birthday is then derived as `p_shared = p_total - p_no_shared`.

4. **Reducing the Fraction**:
   - The program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `A` and `B` to reduce the fraction to its irreducible form.
   - Finally, it prints `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Large Values of n and k**:
   - Given that `n` can be as large as `10^18`, calculating `2^n` directly will result in an overflow in practical programming languages. However, the program does not actually compute `2^n` directly; instead, it uses bitwise operations which are safe in Python.
  
2. **Minimum Values**:
   - When `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output should be `1 2` because there are 2 days and 2 people, which leads to a 100% chance of a shared birthday.

3. **Special Case**:
   - When `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the program should output `1 1` because there are only 2 days, and 3 people must share a birthday.
  
4. **General Case**:
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the expected output is `1 8`, which the program correctly computes.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the logic and the edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem requirements. 

There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
