The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but we know that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments of `n` and `k` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
