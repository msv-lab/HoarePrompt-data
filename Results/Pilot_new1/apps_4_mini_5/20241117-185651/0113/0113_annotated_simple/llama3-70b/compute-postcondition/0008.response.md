The loop increments `n` until `n` becomes a multiple of `x`, which is 10. The loop will execute as long as `n` is not divisible by 10. 

If `n` is already a multiple of 10 at the start, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain unchanged. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is incremented by 1, and `n` is in the range of 1 to 10^9 + 1, not equal to 10. 

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is incremented by 2, and `n` is in the range of 2 to 10^9 + 2, not equal to 10 or 11.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is incremented by 3, and `n` is in the range of 3 to 10^9 + 3, not equal to 10, 11, or 12.

The loop will continue executing until `n` is a multiple of 10. The possible values of `n` after the loop ends can be 10, 20, 30, etc., depending on the initial value of `n`. 

If `n` starts as a multiple of 10, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`if n is a multiple of 10 then n remains unchanged; if n is not a multiple of 10, then n will be incremented until it becomes the next multiple of 10, which will be in the range of 10 to 10^9 + 10`**
