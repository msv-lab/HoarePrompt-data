The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, the possible values for `x` will range from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and `k`, along with the computed value of `x`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 ** k**
