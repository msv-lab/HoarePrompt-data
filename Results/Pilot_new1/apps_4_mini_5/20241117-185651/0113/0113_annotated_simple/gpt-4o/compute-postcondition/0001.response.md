To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the expression `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \).
- `multiplier` is an integer that can take specific values: \( 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000 \).

The value of `x` will be calculated based on the values of `n` and `multiplier`, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and `multiplier` will be used in the calculation.

The output state will reflect the computed value of `x` as well as the unchanged values of `n` and `multiplier`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `multiplier` is an integer that can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; `x` is calculated as n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))**
