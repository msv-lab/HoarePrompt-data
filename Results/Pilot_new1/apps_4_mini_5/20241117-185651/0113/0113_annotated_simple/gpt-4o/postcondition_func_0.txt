The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as 10 raised to the power of `k`, computes the value of `x` as `n` multiplied by the quotient of `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`, and returns this computed value `x`. It does not handle cases where `n` is non-positive or `k` is negative, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about input validity.
