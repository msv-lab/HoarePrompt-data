To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic behind it.

### Problem Understanding:
The goal is to find the smallest positive integer \( x \) such that:
1. \( x \) is divisible by \( n \).
2. \( x \) ends with at least \( k \) zeros in base 10.

This means \( x \) must be a multiple of \( n \) and must also be a multiple of \( 10^k \).

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
```

1. **Multiplier Calculation**:
   - `multiplier = 10 ** k` correctly computes \( 10^k \).

2. **Finding the Smallest Multiple**:
   - The expression `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` computes the least multiplier required to ensure that \( n \) multiplied by this value is a multiple of \( 10^k \).
   - This is based on the property that multiplying \( n \) by the quotient of \( 10^k \) and the greatest common divisor (gcd) ensures that the result is the least common multiple of \( n \) and \( 10^k \).

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when \( k = 0 \)**: The output should be \( n \) itself, which the code handles correctly.
- **Case when \( n \) is already a multiple of \( 10^k \)**: The output should be \( n \), which is also handled correctly by the formula.
- **Case when \( n \) is large and \( k \) is at its maximum (8)**: The code should still return a valid output as it calculates the necessary multiplier.

### Testing with Examples:
1. **Input**: `375 4`
   - Calculation: \( 10^4 = 10000 \), \( \text{gcd}(375, 10000) = 125 \)
   - Result: \( 375 \times (10000 // 125) = 375 \times 80 = 30000 \) (Correct)

2. **Input**: `10000 1`
   - Calculation: \( 10^1 = 10 \), \( \text{gcd}(10000, 10) = 10 \)
   - Result: \( 10000 \times (10 // 10) = 10000 \times 1 = 10000 \) (Correct)

3. **Input**: `38101 0`
   - Calculation: \( 10^0 = 1 \), \( \text{gcd}(38101, 1) = 1 \)
   - Result: \( 38101 \times (1 // 1) = 38101 \) (Correct)

4. **Input**: `123456789 8`
   - Calculation: \( 10^8 = 100000000 \), \( \text{gcd}(123456789, 100000000) = 1 \)
   - Result: \( 123456789 \times (100000000 // 1) = 12345678900000000 \) (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and testing various edge cases, it appears that the implementation correctly adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. 

Correctness: **True**
