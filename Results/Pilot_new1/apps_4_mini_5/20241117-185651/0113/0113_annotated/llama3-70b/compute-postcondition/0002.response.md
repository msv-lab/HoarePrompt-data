The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `n` will be `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`; `n` is now `n + 1`.
