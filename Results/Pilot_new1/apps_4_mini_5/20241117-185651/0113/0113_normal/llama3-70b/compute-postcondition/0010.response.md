The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as per the provided signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function without additional context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). The specific return value or behavior of the function is not defined in the provided information.**
