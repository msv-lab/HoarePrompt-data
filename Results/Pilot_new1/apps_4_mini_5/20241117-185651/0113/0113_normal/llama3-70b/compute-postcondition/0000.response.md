The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input`, which accepts two space-separated integers and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). Therefore, after execution, the specific values of `n` and `k` will depend on the input provided, but their types will remain as integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8)**
