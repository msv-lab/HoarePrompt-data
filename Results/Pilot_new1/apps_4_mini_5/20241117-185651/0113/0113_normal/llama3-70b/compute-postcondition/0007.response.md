According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop continues as long as `n % x != 0`, which means `n` should not be a multiple of `x` (10 in this case). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1 and not a multiple of 10, so `n` is currently not a multiple of 10. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still not be a multiple of 10. Since `n` was incremented by 1, it is guaranteed that `n` is not a multiple of 10 at that moment.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1 and not a multiple of 10; `k` is a non-negative integer; `x` is 10**
