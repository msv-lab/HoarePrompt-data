Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `x`, which is computed as `n` multiplied by the ratio of `multiplier` to the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is zero, which would lead to an incorrect computation of `x` since the context implies that `n` should be positive. **
