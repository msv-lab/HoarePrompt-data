According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the current route being evaluated, which means it has a value of `i` (where `i` starts from 0). To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented to `i + 1`, and for the loop to continue, it must be less than `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, if `i` is currently the last index (i.e., `i` is `n - 1`), then for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `i + 1`, which is `n` must be greater than `i`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `i + 1`, and since `i` is the index of the current route being evaluated, it should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the original `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`**
