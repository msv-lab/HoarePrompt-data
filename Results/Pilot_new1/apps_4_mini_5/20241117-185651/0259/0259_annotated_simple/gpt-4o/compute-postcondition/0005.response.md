The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the value of `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `wait_time` based on the previously defined relationship.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `wait_time` is `s_i - t` (where `s_i` >= `t`)**
