The code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, this means that `min_wait_time` will now equal `wait_time`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is less than the original `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is less than the original `min_wait_time`**
