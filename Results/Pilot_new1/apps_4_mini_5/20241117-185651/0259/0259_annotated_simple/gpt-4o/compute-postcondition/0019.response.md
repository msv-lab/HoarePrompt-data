The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The initial state indicates that `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which implies that `s_i` is defined and that `t` is also defined, although their specific values are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `wait_time` is calculated based on the difference between `s_i` and `t`, while other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
