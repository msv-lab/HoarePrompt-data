Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains the start time and frequency of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus based on the provided routes and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If no bus routes are suitable (i.e., all routes have start times less than `t` with no valid frequencies), it returns -1. If `n` is 0, indicating no bus routes, it also returns -1.**
