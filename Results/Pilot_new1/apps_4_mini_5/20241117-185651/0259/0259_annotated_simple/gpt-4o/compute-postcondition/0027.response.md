According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which implies that `i` is currently less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Since `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` will change based on the new value of `i`. The variable `wait_time` is also relevant, but since it is not specified to change and only depends on the current values of `s_i` and `d_i`, we will not adjust it unless further information is provided.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- `s_i` and `d_i` need to be updated based on the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
