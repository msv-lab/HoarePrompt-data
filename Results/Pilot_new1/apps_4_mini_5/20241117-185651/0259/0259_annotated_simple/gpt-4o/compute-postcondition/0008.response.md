The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the state, as it simply sets `wait_time` to a specific value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, the first element of `bus_routes[0]` (i.e., `s_i`) is less than `t`, and the value of `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i` (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0); wait_time is 0`.
