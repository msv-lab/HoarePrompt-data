The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[0]`, and it is less than `t`, while `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, we can calculate `wait_time`. 

Since `wait_time` is defined as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, we first evaluate `(t - s_i) % d_i`, which gives us a positive integer less than `d_i`. Thus, `wait_time` will be a positive integer because we are subtracting a smaller number from `d_i`.

The output state will summarize the values of the affected variables. Since `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`, we can express it in terms of those variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` which is a positive integer.**
