Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is non-negative as long as `d_i` is positive, covering all scenarios for the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.***
