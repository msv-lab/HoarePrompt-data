Output State: **If `n` is at least 1, then `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes, and `chosen_route` is the index of the route (1-based) that offers this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1. The loop evaluates each bus route's start time `s_i` and frequency `d_i` against the time `t`, ensuring that `wait_time` is calculated as either the time until the next bus or zero if a bus is already at the stop. It accounts for scenarios where no suitable bus routes exist (e.g., all `s_i < t` with no valid `d_i`).**
