According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and since the current state indicates that `_` (the loop variable) is 0, the loop has executed 0 iterations so far. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, if the loop has executed 0 times, then `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again. Since the state does not specify how many times the loop has executed beyond the current value of `_`, we can conclude that the loop can still execute as long as `n` is greater than `_`.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, `_` should be incremented to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
