The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The variables `n` and `t` maintain their previous values as positive integers within the specified ranges. The execution of this code does not affect the values of `n` and `t`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `buses` is an empty list**
