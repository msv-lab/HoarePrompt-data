The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. Since `buses` is initially an empty list, after executing the code, `buses` will contain one tuple with the values of `s` and `d`. The values of `n`, `t`, `_`, and the contents of `buses` are affected, but `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
