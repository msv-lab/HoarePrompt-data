Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `_` is n-1, `min_time` is float('inf'), `ans` is -1, and `time` is (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to 1; otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. This ensures that `ans` reflects the index of the bus with the minimum time if `time` is less than the initial `min_time`.***
