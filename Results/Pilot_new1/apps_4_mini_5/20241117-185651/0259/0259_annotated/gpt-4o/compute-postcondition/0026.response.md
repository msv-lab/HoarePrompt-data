Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This accounts for all scenarios regarding the comparison of `wait_time` and `min_wait_time`.***
