According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2, and since the loop is still within the bounds of `n`, `n` does not need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is 2**
