Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers. If `s_i` (the start time of the bus route) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, indicating the wait time until the bus departs. If `t` is exactly aligned with the bus schedule (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then `wait_time` is 0, meaning the bus arrives at time `t`. If `t` is not aligned with the bus schedule, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all edge cases, including when `s_i` is less than, equal to, or greater than `t`, as well as the alignment of `t` with the bus schedule.***
