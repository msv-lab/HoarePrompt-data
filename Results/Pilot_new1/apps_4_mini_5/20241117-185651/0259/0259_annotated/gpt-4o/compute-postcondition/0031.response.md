To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100).
2. `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000).
3. `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers.
4. `i` is assigned the value of `n`.
5. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`, which means we are accessing the `(n-1)`-th index of the list (since indexing starts at 0).

The code snippet calculates the `wait_time` using the formula:
```
wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
```
This means:
- We first calculate `t - s_i`, which gives us the time since the last bus departed.
- Then we take this result modulo `d_i` to find out the remainder when divided by `d_i`, which tells us how long until the next bus arrives.
- Finally, we subtract this value from `d_i` to get the `wait_time`.

Since `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from `bus_routes[n]`, we assume that `bus_routes` contains valid tuples such that `bus_routes[n]` is accessible and provides valid integer values for `s_i` and `d_i`.

Now, based on this analysis, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
