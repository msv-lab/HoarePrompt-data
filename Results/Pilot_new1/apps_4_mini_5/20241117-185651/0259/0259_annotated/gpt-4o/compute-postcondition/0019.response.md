The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are taken from the initial state, where `s_i` is the first element of the tuple `bus_routes[2]` and `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. The exact value of `wait_time` depends on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`, but since these values are not provided, we can only state that `wait_time` is calculated based on the difference between `s_i` and `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of bus_routes[2], `d_i` is the second element of bus_routes[2], and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
