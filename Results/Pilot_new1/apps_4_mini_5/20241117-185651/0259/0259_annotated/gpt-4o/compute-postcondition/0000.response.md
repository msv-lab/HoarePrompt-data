The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This assignment does not affect any other variables, and the previous values of `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `min_wait_time` while keeping the other variables as they are.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000; `min_wait_time` is float('inf')**
