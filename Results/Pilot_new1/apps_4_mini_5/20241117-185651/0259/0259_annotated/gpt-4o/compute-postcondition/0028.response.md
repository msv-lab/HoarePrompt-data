The code assigns the values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]` to `s_i` and `d_i`. The variable `i` holds the value of `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will depend on the specific tuple at index `i` in the list `bus_routes`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`**.
