Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple from `bus_routes`, and `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple from `bus_routes`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` remains non-negative. This accounts for cases where `s_i` is less than `t` and the values of `d_i` result in a wait time that is either zero or a positive integer.***
