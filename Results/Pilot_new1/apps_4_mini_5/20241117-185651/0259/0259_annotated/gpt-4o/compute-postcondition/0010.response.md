The variable `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, the calculation of `wait_time` will yield a positive integer value. The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple from `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first tuple from `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
