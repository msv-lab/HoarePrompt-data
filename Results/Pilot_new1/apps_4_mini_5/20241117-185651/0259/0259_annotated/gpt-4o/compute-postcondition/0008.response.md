The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `wait_time` while leaving the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are the first tuple from `bus_routes`, the value of `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`; `wait_time` is 0**.
