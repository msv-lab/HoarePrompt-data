According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its maximum value for the loop, which is `n - 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `n`, which means the loop will not execute again since `i` must be less than `n`. 

Since the loop cannot execute again, no other states need to be adjusted. The state remains unchanged in terms of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `wait_time` since they are not directly affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), bus_routes is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is n**
