The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is taken from `bus_routes[n]`, which is a tuple that corresponds to the index `n`. The value of `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000. Since `s_i` and `t` are both defined, `wait_time` will be calculated based on their specific values.

The other variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and the calculated `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`; `min_wait_time` remains unchanged; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
