Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, while `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n` with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, with `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` unchanged, and `i` equal to `n` with `s_i` and `d_i` also assigned from `bus_routes[n]`. This ensures that all possible scenarios regarding the wait time based on the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are covered.***
