Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes based on the conditions of `s_i` and `d_i`, and `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the route that provides this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all `s_i` are less than `t` and the calculated `wait_time` for all routes is greater than or equal to float('inf'), then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged and `chosen_route` remains -1.**
