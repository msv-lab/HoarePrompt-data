To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we start by analyzing the initial state and the effect of the code:

1. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. This means that `s_i` and `d_i` will hold specific values based on the tuple found at index `n` in the `bus_routes` list.

2. The `wait_time` is calculated using the formula:
   ```
   wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
   ```
   Here, `t` is a positive integer representing time, and `s_i` and `d_i` are the values obtained from `bus_routes[n]`. The calculation involves:
   - Subtracting `s_i` from `t`
   - Taking the result modulo `d_i`
   - Finally, subtracting that result from `d_i` to get `wait_time`.

3. Other variables such as `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`.

Since we don't have the specific values for `s_i`, `d_i`, `t`, and `n`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is calculated as `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`; `min_wait_time` remains unchanged; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
