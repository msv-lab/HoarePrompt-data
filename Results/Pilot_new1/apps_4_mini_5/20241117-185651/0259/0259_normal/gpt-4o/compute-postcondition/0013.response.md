Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is a float greater than `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, and `i` is 0. The `wait_time` is a non-negative integer calculated based on the conditions provided, reflecting the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`.***
