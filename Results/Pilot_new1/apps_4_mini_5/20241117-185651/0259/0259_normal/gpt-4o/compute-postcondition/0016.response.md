Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions of `s_i` and `d_i`, and if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that `min_wait_time` reflects the smallest wait time encountered and `chosen_route` indicates the corresponding route index.***
