The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given the initial state, `s_i` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `t`, which is also a positive integer. Therefore, `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the calculation of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer (s_i - t).**
