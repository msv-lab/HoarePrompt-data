The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are taken from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`, and the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` will determine the specific value of `wait_time`. The other variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the new value of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, `chosen_route` remains unchanged.**
