According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop can execute at least once. The loop variable `_` is typically used as a placeholder when the variable is not needed, so there are no specific adjustments needed for it. 

Since `buses` is an empty list before the loop starts, it does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but it may be relevant within the loop body. However, since the loop can execute regardless of the contents of `buses`, no adjustments are necessary for it to execute.

Thus, the states that need to be acknowledged are that `n` is a positive integer, and `t` is a positive integer. The loop is set to start executing with `_` initialized but not used. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
