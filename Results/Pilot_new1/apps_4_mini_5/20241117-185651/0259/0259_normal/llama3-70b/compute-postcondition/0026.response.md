According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the list `buses`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `buses`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `buses` has at least 2 tuples. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `buses` still has at least 3 tuples (since the loop will execute for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and `i = 2`).

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be set to 2, and `buses` should have at least 3 tuples.

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `min_time` remains unchanged if `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`**
