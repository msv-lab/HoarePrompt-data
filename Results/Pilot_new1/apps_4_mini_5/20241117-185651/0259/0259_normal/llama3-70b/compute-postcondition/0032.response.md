Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated for the buses based on the formula `(t - s) % d`, and `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that has this minimum time. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains tuples, the loop will execute for each tuple, updating `min_time` and `ans` accordingly based on the comparison of `time` with `min_time`.**
