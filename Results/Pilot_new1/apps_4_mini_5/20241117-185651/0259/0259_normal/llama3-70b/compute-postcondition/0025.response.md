Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `min_time` remains unchanged if `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 2. The value of `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d.***
