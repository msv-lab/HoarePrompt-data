Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the English word representation of the number based on its value; if `n` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list; if `n` is between 11 and 19 (inclusive), it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list; if `n` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns the word from the `tens` list; if `n` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, it returns a formatted string combining the tens and ones; however, if `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not produce any output. Additionally, the function does not handle the case when `n` is exactly 10 or 20, which are valid inputs but are not explicitly represented in the annotations.**
