Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19 inclusive, the function prints `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 20 and 99 inclusive, the function prints the corresponding value from the `tens` array for the tens place (`s // 10`), followed by either an empty string if `s` is a multiple of 10 or a hyphen and the corresponding value from the `ones` array for the units place (`s % 10`).***
