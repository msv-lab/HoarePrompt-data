The variable `s` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `s` is unknown, but it is constrained to be an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99**
