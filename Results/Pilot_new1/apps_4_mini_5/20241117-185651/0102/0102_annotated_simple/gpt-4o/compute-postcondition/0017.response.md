Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string formatted as "tens-ones", where `tens` is derived from the `tens` list and `ones` is derived from the `ones` list based on the value of `n`. If `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not execute the if block, and no string representation is returned.***
