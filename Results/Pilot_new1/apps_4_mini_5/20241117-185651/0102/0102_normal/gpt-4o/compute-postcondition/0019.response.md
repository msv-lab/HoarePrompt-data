Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its string representation based on its value. For `n` in the range of 0 to 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. For `n` in the range of 11 to 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. For `n` equal to 10 or a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. For `n` between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, it returns a formatted string combining the appropriate `tens` and `ones` strings. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or greater than 99, which are not covered by the annotations. If `n` is 0, it correctly returns 'zero'.**
