The variable `ones` is assigned a list of string representations of the integers from 0 to 9. The value of `n` is not directly affected by this assignment, and its previous value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `n` and the newly defined list `ones`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']**
