The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on an internal logic that is not specified in the provided information. However, it is mentioned that `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. Since there is no output specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified.**
