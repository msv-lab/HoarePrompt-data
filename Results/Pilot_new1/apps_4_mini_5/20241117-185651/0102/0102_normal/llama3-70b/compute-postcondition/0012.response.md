Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the printed output is the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the printed output corresponds to the string representation of `s` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the printed output combines the appropriate string from the `tens` list with the corresponding string from the `ones` list (if `s` is not a multiple of 10) using a hyphen.***
