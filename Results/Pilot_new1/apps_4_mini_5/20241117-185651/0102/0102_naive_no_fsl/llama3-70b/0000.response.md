Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts an integer score (from 0 to 99) into its English word representation according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles different cases:

1. **Single-digit numbers (0-9)**: The program uses the `ones` list to convert these numbers directly to their corresponding words. For example, an input of `6` correctly outputs `six`.

2. **Teen numbers (10-19)**: The program uses the `teens` list to convert these numbers. For instance, an input of `15` outputs `fifteen` as expected.

3. **Tens (20, 30, ..., 90)**: The program uses the `tens` list for these cases. For example, an input of `20` outputs `twenty`.

4. **Numbers from 21 to 99**: The program combines the appropriate tens and ones using a hyphen when necessary. For example, an input of `99` outputs `ninety-nine` correctly.

The program handles all specified cases correctly, including edge cases such as `0` (which outputs an empty string) and `10` (which outputs `ten`). Since there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, it is correct.
