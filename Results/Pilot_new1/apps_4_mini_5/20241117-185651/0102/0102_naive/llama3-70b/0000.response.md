Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts an integer score (0 to 99) into its English word representation. It handles the following cases:

1. For numbers less than 10, it retrieves the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
2. For numbers from 10 to 19, it retrieves the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
3. For numbers 20 and above, it constructs the word using the `tens` list and appends the appropriate word from the `ones` list if needed, ensuring it correctly formats numbers like 21 as "twenty-one".

All specified cases in the problem description and the provided examples are covered, and no edge cases are overlooked.
