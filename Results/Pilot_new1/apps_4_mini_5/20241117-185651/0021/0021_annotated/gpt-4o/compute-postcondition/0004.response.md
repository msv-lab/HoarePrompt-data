The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The variable `max_pos` holds the index of the value `n` in the list `a`, which is known from the initial state. The absolute value function `abs` computes the distance from 0 to `max_pos`. Therefore, `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`.

The values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the calculated value of `dist1`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, and `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.**
