The variable `n` is reassigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state indicates that `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. The value of `a` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` based on user input while keeping `a` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `n` is updated to the input integer**.
