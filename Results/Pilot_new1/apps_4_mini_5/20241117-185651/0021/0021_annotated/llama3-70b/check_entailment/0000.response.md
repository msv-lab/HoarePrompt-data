To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description to see if the program meets all requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
- The program should find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n after performing exactly one swap.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of size `n`.
   - It correctly identifies the positions of the minimum (`1`) and maximum (`n`) elements in the list.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the current distance between positions of `1` and `n` using `abs(pos1 - posn)`.
   - It then computes `max_dist` as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which appears to consider the maximum distance achievable by swapping.
   - It also computes `min_dist` as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which seems unnecessary for the problem's requirements.
   - Finally, it prints `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`, which is ambiguous in the context of the problem.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations suggest that the function aims to maximize the distance between `1` and `n` after a swap, but the logic used to calculate `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not align with the requirement to perform exactly one swap to achieve maximum distance.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
- **Input**: `5` and `4 5 1 3 2`
  - Expected output: `3`
  - The program should recognize that swapping `1` (at index 2) with `2` (at index 4) results in a maximum distance of `3`.

However, the logic used in the code does not guarantee that it will always yield the correct result for various configurations of `a`. 

### Critical Test Case:
Consider the case where:
- **Input**: `3` and `3 1 2`
  - The positions are `pos1 = 1` (for `1`) and `posn = 0` (for `3`).
  - The current distance is `abs(1 - 0) = 1`. The optimal swap would be between `3` and `2`, resulting in the distance being `2`.
  - The code might not correctly compute this due to its reliance on the arbitrary calculations of `max_dist` and `min_dist`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to ensure the maximum distance after one swap for all possible configurations. The annotations hint at the complexity of the logic, but do not clarify the correct handling of swaps. 

Thus, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
