To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have an array `a` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
2. We need to find the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements.
3. We want to maximize the distance between these two elements by performing exactly one swap.

### Code Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)  # Position of the minimum element (1)
posn = a.index(n)  # Position of the maximum element (n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # Calculation of maximum distance
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)  # Calculation of minimum distance
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))  # Output the result
```

### Logical Issues:
1. The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not correctly account for the necessary swaps to maximize the distance. 
2. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` does not represent the distance correctly after a swap; it just reduces the current distance by 1.
3. The program does not explicitly consider the scenarios where 1 and n are already at the ends of the array or close to each other, which may not yield the correct swap to maximize their distance.
4. The logic of `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` is unclear and does not seem to align with the requirement to find the maximum distance after a swap.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- Expected Output: `3` (after swapping 1 and 4, the distance becomes 3).

However, using the provided code:
- `pos1` = 0 (position of 1)
- `posn` = 3 (position of 4)
- `abs(pos1 - posn)` = 3, thus `max_dist` = `max(3 - 1, 2)` = 2.
- `min_dist` = `min(3 - 1, 2)` = 2.
- The final output will be `max(2, 3 - 2)` = `max(2, 1)` = 2.

This is incorrect because the expected output is 3, not 2.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle cases where the minimum and maximum elements are at the ends of the array or when they are adjacent. The logic for calculating the maximum distance after a swap is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
