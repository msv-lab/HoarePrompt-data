The variable `a` is assigned the value `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes input as a string, splits it into separate components, converts each component to an integer, and creates a list. The previous value of `a` is not defined, but it will now hold a list of `n` distinct integers based on the user input. The value of `n` remains unchanged, still within the range of 2 to 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input**
