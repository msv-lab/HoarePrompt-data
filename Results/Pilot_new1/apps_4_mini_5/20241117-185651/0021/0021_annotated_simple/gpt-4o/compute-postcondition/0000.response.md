The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, but the specific value of `n` after the input is not provided. Other variables, including `a`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and `a` remains a list of n distinct integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and `a` remains a list of n distinct integers**
