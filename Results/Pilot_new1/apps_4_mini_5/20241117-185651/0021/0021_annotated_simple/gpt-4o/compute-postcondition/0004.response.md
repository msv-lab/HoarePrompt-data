The value of `dist1` is assigned the result of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` is previously defined as the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `max_pos` will be a valid index within the list `a`. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute value of `-max_pos`, which is simply `max_pos`.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `a`, and `max_pos`, along with the calculated value of `dist1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`**
