The value of `dist2` is assigned the result of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, we can calculate `dist2` based on the values of `n` and `max_pos`. The absolute value function ensures that `dist2` is non-negative. 

Since the exact values of `n` and `max_pos` are not specified, we can only describe the relationship and possible outcomes. The output state reflects that `dist2` is calculated based on the current values of `n` and `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
