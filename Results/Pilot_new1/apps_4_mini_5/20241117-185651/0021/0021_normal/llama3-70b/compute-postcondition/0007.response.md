The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing a permutation of size `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the permutation provided in `a`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` (within the specified range) and a list `a` (which is a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`) and perform operations based on this permutation. The specific output of the function, however, is not detailed in the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` (a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n) and processes these inputs accordingly.**
