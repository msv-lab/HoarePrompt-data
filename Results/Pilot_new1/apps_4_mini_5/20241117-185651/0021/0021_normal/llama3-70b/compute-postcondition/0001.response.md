The value of `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring to an integer. The previous value of `n` does not affect the assignment of `a`, and since `a` is being initialized based on user input, we cannot determine its exact content. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of integers from user input**
