According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at a value that is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` after this increment. 

If `i` is at its maximum value of `int(math.sqrt(x))`, it means the loop has completed its iterations. Thus, we need to adjust `i` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` to reflect that the loop can no longer execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted since `N`, `K`, and `A` are not directly affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that will contain `i` and `x // i` if `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
