The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` is initially an empty set, after executing this line, `divisors` will now contain the value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A[i] is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now contains `i`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i`.
