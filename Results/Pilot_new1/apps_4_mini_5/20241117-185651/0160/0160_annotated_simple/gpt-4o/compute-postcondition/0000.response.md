The code initializes `divisors` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `N`, `K`, or `A`, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `divisors` is now an empty set while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A[i] is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set**.
