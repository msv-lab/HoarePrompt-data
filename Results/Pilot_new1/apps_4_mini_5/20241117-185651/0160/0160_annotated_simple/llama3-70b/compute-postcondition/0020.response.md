The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, we need to compare these two values. 

The output state will reflect the relationship between `max_divisor` and `i` based on their values. Thus, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of `gcd` and `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
