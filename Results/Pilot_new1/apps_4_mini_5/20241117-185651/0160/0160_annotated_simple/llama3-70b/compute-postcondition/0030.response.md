Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` less than or equal to `gcd`, and `gcd` is at least 1. If `gcd` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, the loop executes at least once, and `max_divisor` will be 1. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` will reflect the largest divisor found without duplication.**
