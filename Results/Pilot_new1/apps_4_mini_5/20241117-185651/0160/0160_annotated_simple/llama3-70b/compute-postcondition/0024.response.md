According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which means the loop has reached its upper limit and cannot execute again because the range defined by `for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1)` has been exhausted.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased back to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, which is the last valid value for `i` in the loop. There are no other states that need to be adjusted since `gcd` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`**
