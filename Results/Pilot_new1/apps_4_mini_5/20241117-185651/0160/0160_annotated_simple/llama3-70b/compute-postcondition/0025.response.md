The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` will be at least 1. The previous value of `max_divisor` is not provided, so we cannot determine its new value explicitly. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
