According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Since the loop iterates from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` is currently at its maximum value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, it must be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` for the loop to potentially execute again. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the next value of `i`. The value of `gcd` and `max_divisor` do not need to be changed, as they are not affected by the loop's iteration limits.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`**
