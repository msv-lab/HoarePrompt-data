According to the code, the loop iterates over the values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. The loop will execute again if the next value of `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` should be at least 3. 

We also need to ensure that `i` is still within the bounds of the loop condition, which is `i <= int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 1. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 3, and we need to check the condition of `gcd` to ensure that `i` does not exceed `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3**
