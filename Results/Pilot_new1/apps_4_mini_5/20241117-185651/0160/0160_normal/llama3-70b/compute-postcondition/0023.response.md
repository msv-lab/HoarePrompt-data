Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Therefore, `max_divisor` will always reflect the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to `gcd`, considering all possible values derived from `i`.***
