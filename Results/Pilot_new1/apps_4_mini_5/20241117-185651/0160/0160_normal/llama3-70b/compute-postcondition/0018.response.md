Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is equal to 1, `max_divisor` remains unchanged as `i * i` will also equal `gcd`. If `gcd` is greater than 1, and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` may also be updated based on the value of `gcd // i`.***
