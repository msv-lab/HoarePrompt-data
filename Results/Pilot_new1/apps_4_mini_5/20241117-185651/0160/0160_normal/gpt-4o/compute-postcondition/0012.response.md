The code adds the value of `x // i` to the set of divisors. The variable `x` remains unchanged, while `i` is already defined as `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, we calculate `x // i` using the current value of `x` and the calculated value of `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each `A_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^6; `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)); `x` is unchanged; `i` is added to the set of divisors; `divisors` now includes `x // i`.**
