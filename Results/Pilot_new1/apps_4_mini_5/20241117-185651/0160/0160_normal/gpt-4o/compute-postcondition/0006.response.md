According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would have taken values from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Since `divisors` is updated based on the current value of `i`, it will not need any adjustments because it will be calculated based on the new value of `i`.

No changes are needed for `N`, `K`, or `A` as they are not affected by the loop's iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that includes `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
