Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9 and `i` is 3. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`, ensuring that `max_divisor` is at least 3. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` retains its previous value.***
