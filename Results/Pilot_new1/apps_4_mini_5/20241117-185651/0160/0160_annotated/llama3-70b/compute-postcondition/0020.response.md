The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is 2, but the initial value of `max_divisor` is unknown as it is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_divisor` is updated based on its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to max(max_divisor, 2)**
