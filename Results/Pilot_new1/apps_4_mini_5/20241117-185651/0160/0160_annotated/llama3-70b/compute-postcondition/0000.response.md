The values of `N` and `K` are assigned from the input, where `input()` accepts a pair of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The initial state indicates that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^9\). The list `A` is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and `N`, `K` are assigned values from input.**
