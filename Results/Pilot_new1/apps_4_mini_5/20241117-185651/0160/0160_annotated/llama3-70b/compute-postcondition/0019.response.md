According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will also be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2. Additionally, we need to ensure that `gcd` remains the same, as it is not modified in this loop.

Thus, the updated state should reflect `i` being 2.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
