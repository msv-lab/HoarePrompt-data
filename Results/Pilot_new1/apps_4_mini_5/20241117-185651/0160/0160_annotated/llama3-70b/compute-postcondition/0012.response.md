According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `gcd`. The loop iterates from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute at least once, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to `1`. If `gcd` is `0`, the loop will not execute because the range would be from `1` to `0`, which is invalid. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `gcd` is at least `1`, and we need to set `i` to `1` for the first iteration.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`**
