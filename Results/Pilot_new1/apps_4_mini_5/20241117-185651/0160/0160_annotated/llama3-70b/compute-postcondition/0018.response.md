Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Thus, `max_divisor` will reflect the largest divisor of `gcd` found during this operation, considering both `i` and `gcd // i` if applicable.***
