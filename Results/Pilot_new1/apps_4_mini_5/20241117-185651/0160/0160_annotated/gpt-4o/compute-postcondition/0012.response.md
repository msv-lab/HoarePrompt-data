To evaluate the impact of the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the state of the variables before and after the execution of the line `divisors.add(x // i)`.

1. **Initial State Analysis**: 
   - `N` is an integer between 2 and 500.
   - `K` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6.
   - `divisors` currently includes the element 3.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `x // i` involves the variables `x` and `i`, which are not defined in the initial state provided. However, we can infer that `x` should be some integer value and `i` should be a positive integer since `x // i` is a valid operation.
   - The result of `x // i` (integer division of `x` by `i`) will yield an integer result, which will then be added to the `divisors` set.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The `divisors` set will now include the new element resulting from `x // i`. 
   - The existing state of `divisors` already contains the element 3, and now it will include the result of the integer division.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since we do not know the specific values of `x` and `i`, we cannot determine the exact result of `x // i`. However, we can state that a new element is added to the `divisors` set.

Given this analysis, the output state can be expressed as follows:

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes the element 3 and the result of `x // i`.**
