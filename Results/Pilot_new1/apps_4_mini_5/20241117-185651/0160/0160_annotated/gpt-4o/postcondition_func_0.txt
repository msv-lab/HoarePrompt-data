The function accepts a list of integers and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. If the list is empty or contains fewer than two elements, the function's behavior is not defined, as the code assumes at least one element exists to calculate the GCD. The function returns the GCD of the elements in the list.
