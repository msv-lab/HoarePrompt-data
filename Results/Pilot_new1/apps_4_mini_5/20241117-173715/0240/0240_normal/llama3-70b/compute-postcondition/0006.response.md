According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `n` is either updated to `c` if `c` is in `t_set` or remains an empty string otherwise.

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the next character in `s`. This means that if `s` has more characters beyond the first one, `c` will be the next character in `s`, and `s` will need to have at least 2 characters.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` should have at least 2 characters.
- `c` should be the second character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `n` is updated based on whether `c` is in `t_set` or remains an empty string.**
