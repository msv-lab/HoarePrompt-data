`n` is assigned the value of `n + c`. Since `n` is an empty string and `c` is the first character of `s`, after execution, `n` will contain the character `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `n` is now equal to `c`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `n` is now equal to `c`**
