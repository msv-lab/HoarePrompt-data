The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be a string representation of that permutation. The initial state of `chars` and `perm` does not change, and only `candidate` is affected.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**.
