Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, it is yielded. If `chars` is empty or contains only leading zeroes, the loop does not execute, and `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged. If all permutations of `chars` do not yield a valid `candidate`, there will be no yields.**
