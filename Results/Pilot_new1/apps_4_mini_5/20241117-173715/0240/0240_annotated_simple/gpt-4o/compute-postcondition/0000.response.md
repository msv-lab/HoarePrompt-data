According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `chars` string. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the characters in `chars`. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character. The length of `chars` is confirmed to be not exceeding 1,000,000, which means it can be empty or contain digits. However, since `chars` is specified as a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it is implied that it is not empty. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `perm` will represent each permutation of `chars`. Since `chars` is a string of digits, we can assume that the first permutation will be the original order of `chars`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `chars` is not empty and set `perm` to the first permutation of `chars`, which is `chars` itself.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is `chars`**
