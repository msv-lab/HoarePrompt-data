According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The variable `perm` will take on each permutation of `chars` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is equal to `chars`, which is the first permutation. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` must take on the next permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is currently equal to `chars`, it will need to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations generated by the `permutations` function. 

The state of `chars` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the loop's context. However, `perm` needs to be adjusted to reflect the next permutation. Since `candidate` is equal to `chars` and only yields if it is valid, it does not need adjustment unless we specify the next permutation.

Thus, the relevant changes to the state are:
- `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `chars`**
