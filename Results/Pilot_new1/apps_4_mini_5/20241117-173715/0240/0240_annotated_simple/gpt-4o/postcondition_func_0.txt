The function accepts a non-empty string of digits `s` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters found in `sub`. It then generates possible numbers from these remaining characters and returns the smallest number from that list. If `sub` contains more characters than available in `s`, the function may produce negative counts in `s_counter`, which indicates an invalid state, but this situation is not explicitly handled in the code.
