To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    n += t
    return int(n)
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes two strings, `s` (the shuffled string received by Kate) and `t` (the remembered substring of `n`).
2. **Character Filtering**: The code creates a set `t_set` from the substring `t`. It then initializes an empty string `n` and iterates over each character `c` in `s`. If `c` is found in `t_set`, it appends `c` to `n`.
3. **Appending Substring**: After the loop, the substring `t` is appended to `n`.
4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function converts the string `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Expected Behavior
According to the problem description, we need to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` that Vasya could have passed to Kate. The integer should:
- Include all characters from `t`.
- Be constructed from the characters in `s`.
- Have no leading zeros unless the number is zero itself.

### Potential Issues
1. **Leading Zeros**: The current implementation does not handle leading zeros correctly. For instance, if `s` contains leading zeros and the substring `t` is such that it leads to a number with leading zeros after concatenation, it will not yield the correct smallest integer representation.
2. **Digit Order**: The order of digits in `n` is determined by the order they appear in `s`. If `s` contains digits that can be rearranged to form a smaller number, the current logic does not account for that.
3. **Output Validity**: The function returns an integer, which means if `n` starts with a zero (and is not just zero), it will be incorrectly represented.

### Example Case
Let's consider the following input:
```
Input
00001234
01
```
In this case:
- The characters from `s` that match `t_set` would be `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `1`, and `2` (resulting in `000012`).
- After appending `t`, we get `00001201`.
- Converting this to an integer results in `1201`, which is correct, but the smallest integer that can be formed is `1002` (which is not returned by the function).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle leading zeros and the order of digits to ensure the smallest possible integer is returned. Therefore, it fails for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
