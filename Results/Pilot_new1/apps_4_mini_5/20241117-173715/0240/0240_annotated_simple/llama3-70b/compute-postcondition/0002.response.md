According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Since `s` is described as a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it must contain at least one digit for the loop to begin. At the start of the loop, `c` will take on the value of the first character in `s`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must be a non-empty string, `c` should be the first character of `s`, and `n` remains an empty string at this point.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
