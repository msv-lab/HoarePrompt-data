Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, the function `is_valid_number` references a variable `n_len` that is not defined within its scope, which will lead to a `NameError`. This means that the function cannot correctly validate whether the length of the generated number matches the expected length derived from the input string.

Additionally, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the possibility of having leading zeros in the generated number `n`. According to the problem description, the decimal representation of `n` should not have leading zeros unless `n` is zero itself, which could lead to invalid outputs.

For example, if the input is:
```
000012
01
```
The function might generate `0000012`, which is invalid as a representation of an integer. The program should return `12` instead, but due to the issues mentioned, it may not do so.

Thus, there are scenarios where the program does not work correctly according to the requirements laid out in the problem description.
