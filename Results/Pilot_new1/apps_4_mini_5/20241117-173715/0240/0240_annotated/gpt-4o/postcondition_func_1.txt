The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It checks if `sub` is present within `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to a variable `n_len`. However, `n_len` is not defined within the function, which will lead to a NameError when the function is executed. Therefore, the functionality is to check for the presence of `sub` in `num_str`, but it will fail due to the undefined `n_len`.
