The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator function, and here it yields the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is equal to `chars`, which is a valid number with respect to `sub`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is equal to `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is equal to `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`**
