The function accepts a string `s` consisting of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the frequency of each character in both `s` and `sub`, then decrements the counts of characters in `sub` from those in `s`. It constructs a string of remaining characters from `s` after removing those in `sub`, generates possible numbers from these characters, and returns the minimum integer value from this list. If `sub` contains characters not present in `s`, or if `s` does not contain any characters from `sub`, the function may produce unexpected results due to negative counts in `s_counter`, potentially affecting the output. Additionally, if `remaining_chars` is empty, this could lead to an error when trying to find the minimum of an empty list.
