According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of digits with a length greater than 1, it has at least 2 characters. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the third character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the next character in the string `s`, which would be the fourth character. Additionally, the length of `s` must be at least 4 to ensure that there is a fourth character to iterate over.

The state of `t_set` and `n` does not need to be adjusted unless we are concerned with the effect of `c` on `n`, but the problem does not indicate that `n` changes when `c` is updated for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with length greater than 3, `c` is the fourth character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` remains unchanged**
