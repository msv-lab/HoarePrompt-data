According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of digits with a length greater than 1, and `c` is the second character of `s`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the current character `c` would need to be updated to the next character in the string `s`. Since `s` has a length greater than 1, we need to ensure that the index of `c` is less than the length of `s`.

If `c` is the second character in `s`, the next character would be the third character, which means we need to adjust `c` to reflect this next character and update the state accordingly. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `t_set` and `n` are not directly impacted by the loop iteration itself but by the conditions inside the loop body.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with length greater than 1, `c` is the third character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`**
