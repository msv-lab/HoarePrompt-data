Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the function prints '+'. Otherwise, the function prints '?'. This covers the case where the maximum number of downvotes is not sufficient to reach the minimum number of upvotes, and ensures that the relationship `x + z >= y` is maintained throughout.***
