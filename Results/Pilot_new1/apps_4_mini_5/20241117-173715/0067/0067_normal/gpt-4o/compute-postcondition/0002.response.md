The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `x` is an integer from input, and `z` is also an integer from input. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be equal to the sum of the values of `x` and `z`. The other variables, `y` and `min_upvotes`, remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z**
