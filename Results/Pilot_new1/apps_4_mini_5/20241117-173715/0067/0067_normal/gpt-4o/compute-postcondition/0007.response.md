Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`).***
