The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle three integer variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Since there are no explicit return conditions or outputs provided in the given information, we cannot determine the specific return values based on the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined with respect to its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified based on the provided constraints.**
