The function accepts three integers from user input, representing `x`, `y`, and `z`. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. The function then checks the relationships between the maximum upvotes and minimum downvotes, as well as between the maximum downvotes and minimum upvotes, to determine the output. It prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, or '?' if neither condition is met, indicating that the values are within the expected ranges.
