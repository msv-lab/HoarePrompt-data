The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The initial values of `y` and `z` are both integers between 0 and 100, so the value of `max_downvotes` will also be an integer between 0 and 200 (since the maximum value of `y + z` can be 100 + 100 = 200). The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
