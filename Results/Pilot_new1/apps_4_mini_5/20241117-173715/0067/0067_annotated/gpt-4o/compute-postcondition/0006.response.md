The code executes a print statement that outputs a hyphen ('-'). This action does not modify any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` (which is equal to `y`).**
