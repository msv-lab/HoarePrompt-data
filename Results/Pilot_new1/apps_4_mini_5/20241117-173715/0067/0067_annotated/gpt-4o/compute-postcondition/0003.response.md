`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The initial value of `y` is between 0 and 100, so `min_downvotes` will also be between 0 and 100. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y**
