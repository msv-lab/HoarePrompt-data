Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the function prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the function prints '0' if `z` is 0, and '?' if `z` is not 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, the function prints '?'.***
