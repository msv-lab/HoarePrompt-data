The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `'?'`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged after this execution. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `z` is greater than 0, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `z` is greater than 0, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '?'**
