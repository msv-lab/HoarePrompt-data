The code prints a hyphen ('-'), which does not change the values of any variables. The initial conditions remain intact, so the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`), and a hyphen ('-') is printed.**
