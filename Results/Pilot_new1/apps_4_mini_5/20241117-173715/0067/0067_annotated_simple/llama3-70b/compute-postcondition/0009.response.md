The code prints the string '0', and this does not change the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variables. The output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100; `x` is equal to `y`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; and `z` is equal to 0, and the function prints '0'.
