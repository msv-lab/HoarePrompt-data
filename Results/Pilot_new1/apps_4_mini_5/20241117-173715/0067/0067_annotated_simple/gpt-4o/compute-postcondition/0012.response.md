Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the output is '+'. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, the output is '?'. This ensures that the relationships between upvotes and downvotes are maintained according to the given conditions.***
