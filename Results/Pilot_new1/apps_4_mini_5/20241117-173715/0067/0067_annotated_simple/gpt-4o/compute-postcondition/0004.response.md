The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are both integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be in the range from `0 + 0` to `100 + 100`, which means it can take any value from 0 to 200. The other variables (`x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`**.
