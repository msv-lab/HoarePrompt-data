The `print('+')` statement outputs the character `+` to the console. It does not affect the values of any of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, or `min_upvotes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, meaning that `y + z` is less than `x`; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; and the output is '+'**
