The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, and `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, and `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`**
