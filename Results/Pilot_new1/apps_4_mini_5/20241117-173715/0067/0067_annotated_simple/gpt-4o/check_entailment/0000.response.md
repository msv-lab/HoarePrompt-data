To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

The program reads three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively. It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the unknown votes `z`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Maximum Upvotes (`max_upvotes`)**: This is calculated as `x + z`, which represents the scenario where all unknown voters upvote.
2. **Minimum Upvotes (`min_upvotes`)**: This is simply `x`, the known upvotes.
3. **Maximum Downvotes (`max_downvotes`)**: This is calculated as `y + z`, which represents the scenario where all unknown voters downvote.
4. **Minimum Downvotes (`min_downvotes`)**: This is simply `y`, the known downvotes.

Next, the program checks:
- If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it means there's no possible way for upvotes to exceed downvotes, so it prints `-`.
- If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it means there's no possible way for downvotes to exceed upvotes, so it prints `+`.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints `?`, indicating uncertainty.

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the program against the provided examples and the problem description:

1. **Example 1**: Input `3 7 0`  
   - Here, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`.  
   - `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` is true, so the output is `-`. (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: Input `2 0 1`  
   - Here, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`.  
   - `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` is true, so the output is `+`. (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: Input `1 1 0`  
   - Here, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`.  
   - Neither condition is true, so the output is `?`. (Correct, but should be `0` according to the problem description)

4. **Example 4**: Input `0 0 1`  
   - Here, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`.  
   - `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` is true, so the output is `+`, which is incorrect according to the problem description (should be `?`).

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly handle the case when `x` and `y` are equal with no unknown votes, as well as the case when both `x` and `y` are zero with one unknown vote. The output for these cases does not match the expected results based on the problem description.

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
