Functionality: ** The function reads a string input from the user, checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end, and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome or 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not return any value but only prints the result. It handles strings of length 1 to 1000, where single-character strings are always considered palindromes. **
