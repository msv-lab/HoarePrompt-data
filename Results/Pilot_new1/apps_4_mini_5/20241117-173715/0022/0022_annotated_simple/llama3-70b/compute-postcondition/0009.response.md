The value of `is_spalindrome` is assigned `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is now False.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
