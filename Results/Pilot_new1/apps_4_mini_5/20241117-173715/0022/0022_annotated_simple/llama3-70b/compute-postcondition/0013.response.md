The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
