Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in the string `s` are not equal, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, and the check for palindrome continues.***
