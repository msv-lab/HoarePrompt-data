The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
