Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome (including when `s` is an empty string or a single character), and returns `False` if any mismatched characters are found during the comparison. If `s` has a length of 1 or 0, it is considered a palindrome by default. **
