The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` (ranging from 0 to 10^9), rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10, and prints the result. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down; if it is greater than 5, it rounds up. The function does not return a value, only prints the rounded result.
