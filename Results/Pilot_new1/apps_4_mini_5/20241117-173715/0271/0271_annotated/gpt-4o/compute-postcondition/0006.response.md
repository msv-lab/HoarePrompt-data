Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9. If `remainder` (which is `n % 10` and is between 0 and 9) is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is set to `n - remainder`, effectively rounding down `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is set to `n + (10 - remainder)`, rounding `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10. Thus, `result` will always be the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`.***
