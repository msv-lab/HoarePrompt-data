To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, we need to analyze the code and see if it handles all specified cases correctly.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0.
2. If `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded.
3. The output must correctly reflect the rounding behavior, where:
   - If the last digit (remainder when divided by 10) is less than or equal to 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
   - If the last digit is greater than 5, round up to the nearest multiple of 10.
4. The function should handle all values of `n` within the range of 0 to 10^9.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    remainder = n % 10
    if (remainder <= 5) :
        result = n - remainder
    else :
        result = n + (10 - remainder)
    print(result)
```

### Code Annotations Summary:
- The function calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10.
- If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference to the next multiple of 10.
- The function prints the result which is the nearest multiple of 10.

### Evaluation of Edge Cases:
1. **Case n = 0**: 
   - `remainder = 0`, rounds down to `0`. Correct.
2. **Case n = 5**:
   - `remainder = 5`, rounds down to `0`. Correct.
3. **Case n = 10**:
   - `remainder = 0`, remains `10`. Correct.
4. **Case n = 15**:
   - `remainder = 5`, rounds down to `10`. Correct.
5. **Case n = 25**:
   - `remainder = 5`, rounds down to `20`. Correct.
6. **Case n = 30**:
   - `remainder = 0`, remains `30`. Correct.
7. **Case n = 11**:
   - `remainder = 1`, rounds down to `10`. Correct.
8. **Case n = 14**:
   - `remainder = 4`, rounds down to `10`. Correct.
9. **Case n = 16**:
   - `remainder = 6`, rounds up to `20`. Correct.
10. **Case n = 19**:
    - `remainder = 9`, rounds up to `20`. Correct.
11. **Case n = 1000000000**:
    - `remainder = 0`, remains `1000000000`. Correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the specified cases according to the problem description. The annotations provide clarity on how the rounding is performed and confirm that the logic is correctly implemented.

Since I could not find any case where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0 for all valid inputs within the given range.
