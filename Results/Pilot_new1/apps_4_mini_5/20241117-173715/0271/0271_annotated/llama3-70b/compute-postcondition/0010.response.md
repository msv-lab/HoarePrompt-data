The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no specific outputs or conditions provided in the output section, we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
