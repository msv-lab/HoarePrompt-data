Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. It checks if the number `n` ends with `0`, in which case it simply prints `n`. If it does not, it checks whether the last digit is less than or equal to `5` to round down to the nearest multiple of `10`, or greater than `5` to round up to the next multiple of `10`. The logic covers all possible cases, including when `n` is `0`, and adheres to the requirements of rounding to the nearest integer that ends with `0`. Therefore, I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected.
