The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the internal logic defined within the function body. Given the constraints, `n` is a non-negative integer where \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no parameters to accept, the function's output is not dependent on any external input. The output behavior is not explicitly stated in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is determined by its internal logic.**
