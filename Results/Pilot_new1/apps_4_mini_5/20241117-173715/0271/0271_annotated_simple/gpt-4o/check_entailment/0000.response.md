To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function according to the problem description.

The problem states that Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it should remain unchanged.

### Analyzing the Code
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input.
2. **Rounding Logic**:
   - It calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 (`remainder = n % 10`).
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 (`result = n - remainder`).
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10 (`result = n + (10 - remainder)`).

### Edge Cases
- **Case when `n` is 0**: 
  - Input: `0`
  - Remainder: `0 % 10 = 0`, which is ≤ 5. 
  - Result: `0 - 0 = 0`. This is correct.
  
- **Case when `n` is a multiple of 10**:
  - Input: `20`
  - Remainder: `20 % 10 = 0`, which is ≤ 5.
  - Result: `20 - 0 = 20`. This is correct.
  
- **Case when `n` is between two multiples of 10**:
  - Input: `5`
  - Remainder: `5 % 10 = 5`, which is ≤ 5.
  - Result: `5 - 5 = 0`. This is correct.
  
- **Case when `n` is just above a multiple of 10**:
  - Input: `11`
  - Remainder: `11 % 10 = 1`, which is ≤ 5.
  - Result: `11 - 1 = 10`. This is correct.
  
- **Case when `n` is just below a multiple of 10**:
  - Input: `19`
  - Remainder: `19 % 10 = 9`, which is > 5.
  - Result: `19 + (10 - 9) = 19 + 1 = 20`. This is correct.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description. It rounds down when the remainder is ≤ 5 and rounds up when the remainder is > 5, including cases where `n` is already a multiple of 10.

Since I could not find any input case where the program does not work as expected, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
