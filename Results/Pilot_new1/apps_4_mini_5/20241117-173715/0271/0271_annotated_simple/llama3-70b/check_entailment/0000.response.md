To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic based on the problem description and the code itself.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it remains unchanged. If not, the rounding should be done based on the last digit of `n`:
- If the last digit is between 0 and 5 (inclusive), round down to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
- If the last digit is greater than 5, round up to the nearest higher multiple of 10.

### Code Analysis:
Hereâ€™s the provided code with its logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n % 10 == 0) :
        print(n)
    else :
        if (n % 10 <= 5) :
            print(n - n % 10)
        else :
            print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

1. **First Condition**: `if (n % 10 == 0)` checks if `n` is a multiple of 10.
   - If true, it prints `n`, which is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Second Condition**: If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it checks the last digit using `n % 10`.
   - If the last digit is `<= 5`, it calculates `n - n % 10`, which gives the nearest lower multiple of 10. This is correct.
   - If the last digit is `> 5`, it calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which gives the nearest higher multiple of 10. This is also correct.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when `n = 0`**: The output should be `0`, which the code handles correctly.
- **Case when `n = 5`**: The output can be either `0` or `10`, and the code correctly rounds to `0`.
- **Case when `n = 15`**: The output should be `20`, which the code handles correctly.
- **Case when `n = 25`**: The output should be `20`, which the code handles correctly.
- **Case when `n = 10^9`**: The output should be `1000000000`, which the code handles correctly.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the rounding logic as specified in the problem description for all potential cases. There are no edge cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
