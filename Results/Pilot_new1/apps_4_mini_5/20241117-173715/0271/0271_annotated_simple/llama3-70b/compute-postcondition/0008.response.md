Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9 and is not a multiple of 10. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the nearest lower multiple of 10. If the remainder is greater than 5, the function prints the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
