The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since `n` is not provided as an argument to the function, it implies that the function may utilize a predefined or globally accessible value for `n`. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details about what the function does with `n`, we cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a non-negative integer n, which is constrained to the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The output of the function is not specified.**
