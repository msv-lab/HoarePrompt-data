Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (within the range 0 to 10^9) and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n` itself. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the nearest lower multiple of 10. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the next higher multiple of 10.**
