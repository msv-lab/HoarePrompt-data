The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate based on a non-negative integer `n`, where `n` is constrained such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, the specific output or behavior of the function is not provided in the given information. Therefore, we can only state the parameter constraints without detailing the return values or functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a non-negative integer n, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
