The value of `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is greater than 5, the expression `(10 - remainder)` will yield a positive value. Therefore, `result` will be greater than `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, `remainder` is greater than 5, and `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
