The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state reflects that `n` now holds the value of the input integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer based on the input**
