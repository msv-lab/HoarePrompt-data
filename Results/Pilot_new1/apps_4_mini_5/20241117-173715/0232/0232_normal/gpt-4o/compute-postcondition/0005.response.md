Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, `current_counts` is updated with the count of the color at index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and for every color in `desired_counts`, the count in `current_counts` matches the corresponding count in `desired_counts`.***
