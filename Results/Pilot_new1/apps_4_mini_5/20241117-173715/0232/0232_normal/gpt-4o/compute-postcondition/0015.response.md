Output State: **If all color counts in `current_counts` are greater than or equal to their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the loop will execute. After the loop, if all counts in `current_counts` exactly match those in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If any color count in `current_counts` falls below its corresponding value in `desired_counts`, the loop will end, `left` will be incremented, and `current_counts` will reflect the decremented count of the color at index `left`. If `n` is 0 or if there are no colors in `desired_counts`, the loop will not execute, and `current_counts` will remain unchanged.**
