Postcondition: ***`found` is False initially, but if all values in `window_counts` (after incrementing `window_counts[color]` by 1) match their corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` becomes True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1.***
