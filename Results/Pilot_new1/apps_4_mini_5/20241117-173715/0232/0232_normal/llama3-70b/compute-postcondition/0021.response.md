The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, so `color_counts` is unchanged, `found` is still False, `i` is still 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the output state reflects these unchanged values and the new state of `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
