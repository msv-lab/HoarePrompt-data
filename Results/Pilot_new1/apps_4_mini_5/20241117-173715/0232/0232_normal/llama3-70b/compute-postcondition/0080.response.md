Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` after `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, where `color` is assigned from `colors[j]` and `j` is `i + 1`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the loop continues. Additionally, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is `i + 1`.***
