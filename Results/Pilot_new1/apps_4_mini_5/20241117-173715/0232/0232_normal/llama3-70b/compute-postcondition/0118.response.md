Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop, leaving `window_counts` unchanged, and the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain as they were. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being an empty dictionary, `colors` being a non-empty list, and the values of `n`, `i`, and `j` unchanged.***
