Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, while `i`, `n`, `j`, `color`, and the increment of `window_counts[color]` remain unchanged.***
