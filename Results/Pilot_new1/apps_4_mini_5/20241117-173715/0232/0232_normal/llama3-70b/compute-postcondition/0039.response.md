Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, while `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `j` is `i + 1`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the state of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.***
