The code assigns the variable `colors` to a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `m` also remains unchanged. The values of `colors` depend on the input provided, which is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `colors` is a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers derived from input**
