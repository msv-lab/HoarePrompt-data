Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 to `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is between 1 and `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, and at least one count in `current_counts` is less than its corresponding desired count in `desired_counts`. If all elements in `current_counts` match their corresponding elements in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If there are any mismatches, the function does not return 'YES'.
