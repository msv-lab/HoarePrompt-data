The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The initial state indicates that `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` is empty, `i` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i`. Since `window_counts` is being assigned a new value, it will now be an empty dictionary. The other variables are unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` is {}, `i` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i`**
