The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` has `color` with a value of 1, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
