Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `color` is the first element in the `colors` list. If `color` is not present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, there are no changes made to `color_counts`.***
