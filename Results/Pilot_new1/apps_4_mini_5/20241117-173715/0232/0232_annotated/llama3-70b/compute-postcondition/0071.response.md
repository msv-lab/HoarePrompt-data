The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
