Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, and `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the program continues without breaking out of the loop. The variable `j` is incremented to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`, with `window_counts[color]` reflecting the updated count.***
