The code assigns an empty dictionary to `window_counts`. The previous state indicates that `window_counts` was already an empty dictionary, and the other variables `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary, and the other variables are unaffected. 

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`**
