Output State: **`window_counts` contains the count of each color encountered in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`. If all counts in `window_counts` (sorted) match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True; otherwise, it remains False. If `n` is equal to or less than `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains False, `i` and `j` remain unchanged.**
