According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `right` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. The loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `right` equal to 0 and ending at `right` equal to `n-1`. 

Since `n` is given to be between 1 and 100 (inclusive), it guarantees that `right` will take on valid values within this range. The variable `left` is initialized to 0, which is acceptable since it does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Before the loop starts, the relevant states are as follows:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), ensuring that the loop will have iterations.
- `right` will start at 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, as all necessary conditions are already satisfied.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `right` is 0, `left` is 0**
