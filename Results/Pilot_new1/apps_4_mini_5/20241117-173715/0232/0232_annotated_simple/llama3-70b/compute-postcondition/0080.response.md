Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` sorted match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the values do not match, the program continues execution without making any changes to `found`.***
