Output State: **`found` is True if a valid window of colors is found that matches the counts in `counts`; otherwise, `found` remains False. `j` will be the index of the last color processed in the loop, which will be at most `n - 1`. `color` will be the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. `window_counts` will contain the counts of colors encountered from index `i` to `j`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `found` as False, `j` undefined, `color` undefined, and `window_counts` unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, resulting in `found` as False, `j` undefined, `color` undefined, and `window_counts` remaining an empty dictionary.**
