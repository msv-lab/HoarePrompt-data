Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `color` is assigned `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited; otherwise, the loop continues without any change to `found`.***
