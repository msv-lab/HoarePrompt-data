Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` remains True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
