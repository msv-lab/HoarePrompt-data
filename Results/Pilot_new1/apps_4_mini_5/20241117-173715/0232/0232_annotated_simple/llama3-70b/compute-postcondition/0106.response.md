According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and since `n` is not specified, we only know that it is greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, so it will be `j = i + 1`, and it must still satisfy the condition `j < n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to `i + 1`, while `found` remains unchanged because it only indicates if the current window has the required counts.

State: **`found` is True, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
