Output State: **If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated according to the given formula for each iteration of the loop. After the loop execution, dp[n, k] will be the final calculated value, n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and i is at least 1.**
