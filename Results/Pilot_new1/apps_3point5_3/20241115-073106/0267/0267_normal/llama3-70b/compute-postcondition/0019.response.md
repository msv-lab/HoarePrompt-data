Example Answer: 
The value of dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo of dp[n, k] with MOD. After the loop execution, dp[n, k] will be the final calculated value. The previous values of dp[n, k] are not provided, so the output state is: dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo with MOD.
Output State: **dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo with MOD**
