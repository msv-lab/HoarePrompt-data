According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values where the pair (n, k) is not present and `dp[n, k]` is updated according to the given formula, `i` is 2**
