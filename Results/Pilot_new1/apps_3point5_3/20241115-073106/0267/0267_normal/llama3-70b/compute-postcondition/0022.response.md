The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. 

Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. In all other cases, the initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Case 2: If (n, k) is present in `dp`, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`. Otherwise, there is no change in the initial state of the variables.

Case 3: The function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]` if (n, k) is present in `dp`, otherwise, it returns None.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store previously calculated values. The function then returns 0 if `k` is 0, the value stored in `dp[n, k]` if it exists, and None otherwise.
