Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If n < 10 ** k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated by performing a series of calculations involving k and n to determine its final value, which is then taken modulo MOD. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of n and k values, ensuring the correct computation and storage of values in dp.***
