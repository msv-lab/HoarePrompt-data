According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and the condition `l` less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD. `l` remains less than or equal to `r`, and `num` remains equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false, there is no change in the values of the variables.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `num` needs to be incremented by 1
- `l` remains the same
- `r` remains the same

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1`**
