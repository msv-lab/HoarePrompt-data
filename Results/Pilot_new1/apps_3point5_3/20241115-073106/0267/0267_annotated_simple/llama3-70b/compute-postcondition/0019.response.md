Example Answer:
The value of dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo operation with MOD. If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop won't execute, and dp[n, k] remains 9. If k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated with the modulo operation result. Therefore, the Output State is: dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation.
Output State: **dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation**
