Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If (n, k) is already present in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If n < 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated based on the modulo operation involving various calculations.***
