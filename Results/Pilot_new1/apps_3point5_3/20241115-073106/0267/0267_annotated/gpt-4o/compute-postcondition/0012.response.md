Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are integers. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for any `num` in the range, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all `num` in the range, no changes are made to the variables. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute.**
