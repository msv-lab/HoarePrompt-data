Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is equal to the next value after `l` that satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`. The values of `l` and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated based on the calculation, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to the next value after `l` that satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the calculation, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to the next value after `l` that satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`**
