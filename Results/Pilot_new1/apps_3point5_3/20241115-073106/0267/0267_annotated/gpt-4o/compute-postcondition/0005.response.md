According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`, and `num` satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to the value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The relationship between `total_sum`, `l`, `num`, and the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k` is maintained after the execution of the if statement. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next value after `l`, and it should still satisfy the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l` that satisfies the condition of `func_1` with parameter `k`**
