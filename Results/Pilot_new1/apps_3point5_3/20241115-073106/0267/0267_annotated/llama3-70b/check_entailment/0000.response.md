Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code, the provided functions `func_1` and `count` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. It utilizes the `count` function to perform the necessary calculations.

The `count` function handles different cases based on the value of `k` and accurately calculates the sum of numbers meeting the criteria specified in the problem description. It uses dynamic programming to store previously calculated values and efficiently computes the final result.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, and the provided examples are correctly calculated by the functions. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
