Functionality: **The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values. 

The function first checks if `k` equals 0, in which case it returns 0. If the key (n, k) is present in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, it calculates a new value for dp[n, k] based on the given formula involving `n`, `k`, and MOD. The final result is then returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to calculate and return values based on the conditions mentioned above.**
