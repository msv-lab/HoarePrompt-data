Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp[n, k] is updated with a new value based on the given formula, i is 2.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp[n, k] is updated with a new value based on the given formula, i is 2**
