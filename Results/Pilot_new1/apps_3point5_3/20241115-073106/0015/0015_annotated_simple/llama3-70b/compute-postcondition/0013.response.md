Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' if `a` is not equal to `b'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program checks if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) holds true. If the condition is met, 'YES' is printed, indicating that the program handles cases where the result of (b - a) is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative. If the condition is not met, 'NO' is printed, covering scenarios where the division result is negative or the condition is not satisfied. The postcondition ensures the proper handling of all possible input combinations and edge cases, guaranteeing the correct behavior of the program.***
