Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence `a`, then the program correctly prints "YES".
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements of the sequence is 0 (`c == 0`), then the program correctly prints "NO".
3. If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, meaning that Vasya's favorite number `b` can be reached by adding multiples of the difference `c` to the first element `a`, then the program correctly prints "YES".
4. In all other cases, where Vasya's favorite number `b` cannot be reached by adding multiples of the difference `c` to the first element `a`, the program correctly prints "NO".

Therefore, the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and is correct.
