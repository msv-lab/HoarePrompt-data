Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split operation. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied. If the condition is not met, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all scenarios including when `c` is not equal to 0, the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of dividing `b` minus `a` by `c` is greater than or equal to 0, as well as cases where these conditions are not met.***
