Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence as described in the problem statement. It checks for three main cases:
1. If b is equal to the first element of the sequence (a), it prints 'YES'.
2. If the difference between b and a is divisible by the common difference c and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES'. This covers the case where b is present in the sequence.
3. If the common difference c is 0, it prints 'NO' as the sequence will not contain b.

These conditions cover all possible scenarios based on the problem description and provide the correct output for each case.
