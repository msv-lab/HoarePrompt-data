Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 
- If the difference between `a` and `b` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, the code prints 'YES'. This covers the case where Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence.
- If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the code prints 'YES'. This covers the case where Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence.
- For all other cases where `b` does not appear in the sequence, the code prints 'NO'.

The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the code and the scenarios it covers, including edge cases. In this case, the code and annotations align with the problem description, and all provided examples work correctly.
