Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then `total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. Finally, the value of `total_fruits` is printed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, so their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4**
