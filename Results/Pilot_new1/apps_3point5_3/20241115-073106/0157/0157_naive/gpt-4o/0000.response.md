Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratios. It ensures that the number of pears required is the limiting factor in determining the maximum total number of fruits that can be used. The logic of using the minimum of the ratios of each fruit type ensures that the compote is made in the correct ratio. The program produces the correct output for all possible input cases as described in the problem statement.
