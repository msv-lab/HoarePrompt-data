Example Answer:
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, so if `res` is 'a' and `char` is 'b', after execution, `res` becomes 'ab'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter followed by the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the letter after the next lowercase English letter, `res` is the next lowercase English letter followed by the next lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter**
