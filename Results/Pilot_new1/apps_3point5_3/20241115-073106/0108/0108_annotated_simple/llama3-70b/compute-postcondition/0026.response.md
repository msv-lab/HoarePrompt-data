Example Answer:
The code snippet `res += char` appends the current value of `char` to the end of `res`. The previous state of `res` is unknown, and the value of `char` depends on the next character in the `alphabet`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated with the value of `char`.
Output State: **`res` is updated with the value of `char`**
