Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If the first lowercase English letter in `s` is found, `res` contains all lowercase English letters in sequence up to that point, and `char` is the next lowercase English letter. If the first lowercase English letter is not found in `s`, `res` is empty, and `char` is the next lowercase English letter. If `s` is empty, `res` remains empty, and `char` is the first lowercase English letter. If the length of `res` is 26, the function prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1.***
