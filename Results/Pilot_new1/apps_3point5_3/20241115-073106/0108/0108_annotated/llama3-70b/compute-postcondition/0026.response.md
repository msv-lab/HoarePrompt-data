Example Answer:
The character 'char' is added to the 'res' string in each iteration. The 'char' variable contains the character following the last 'a' replaced in the 's' string. Therefore, after execution, the 'res' string will contain all the characters following the 'a' characters replaced in 's'.
Output State: **If 'char' is in 's' then 'res' contains the characters added in each iteration, 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a' with the next character, 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'**
