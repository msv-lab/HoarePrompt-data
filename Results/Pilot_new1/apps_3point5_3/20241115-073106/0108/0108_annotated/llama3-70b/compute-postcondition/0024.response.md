Output State: **If 'char' is in 's' then 'res' contains the characters added in each iteration, 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a' with the next character, 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'. If 'char' is not in 's' then the loop does not execute and 's', 'res', and 'char' remain unchanged.**
