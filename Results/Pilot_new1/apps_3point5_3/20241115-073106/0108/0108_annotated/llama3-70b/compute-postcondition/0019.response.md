Example Answer: 
The character 'char' is replaced with the character following it in 's' only once. The 'char' variable is then updated to this new character. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'.
Output State: **'s' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'**
