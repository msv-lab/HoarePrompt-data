Example Answer:
The value of `res` is updated by adding the value of `char`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is: 's' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'.
Output State: **'s' is the updated string after replacing 'a', 'res' is updated accordingly with the addition of 'char', 'char' is the character following the last character replaced in 's'**
