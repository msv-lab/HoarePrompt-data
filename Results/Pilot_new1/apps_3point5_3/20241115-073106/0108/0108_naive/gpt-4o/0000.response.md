Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the given string and the target alphabet string, checking if the characters match. If the program reaches the end of the target alphabet string, it means that the given string can be transformed into the target alphabet as a subsequence. Otherwise, it prints -1. The logic seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
