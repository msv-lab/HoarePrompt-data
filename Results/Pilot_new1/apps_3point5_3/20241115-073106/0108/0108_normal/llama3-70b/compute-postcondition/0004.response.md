Example Answer:
The first character of the `alphabet` string is assigned to `char`, and then `char` is concatenated to the `res` string. Since `res` was initially empty, after this operation, `res` will contain the first character of the `alphabet` string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string containing all small English letters, `res` contains the first character of the `alphabet` string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string containing all small English letters, `res` contains the first character of the `alphabet` string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string**
