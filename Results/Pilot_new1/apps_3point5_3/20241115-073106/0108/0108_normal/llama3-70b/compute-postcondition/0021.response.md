Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the `res` string. The value of `char` is unknown, so the resulting `res` string will have an additional unknown character at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string with one character replaced with the next ASCII character, `res` has been appended with an unknown character.
Output State: **`s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string with one character replaced with the next ASCII character, `res` has been appended with an unknown character**
