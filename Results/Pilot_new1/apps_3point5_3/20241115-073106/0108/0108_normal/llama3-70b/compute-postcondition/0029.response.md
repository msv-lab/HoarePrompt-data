Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is `s` is updated based on the replacement, `res` contains the replaced characters, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string.
Output State: **`s` is updated based on the replacement, `res` contains the replaced characters, and `char` is updated to the next character in the alphabet string**
