Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads a string `s` from the input.
- It iterates through the alphabet and for each character in the alphabet:
  - It checks if that character exists in the input string `s`.
  - If found, it appends that character to the result string `res`.
  - It replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet.
- If `s` contains all characters in the alphabet (26 characters), it prints the resulting string `res`.
- If the length of `res` is 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1.

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It ensures that the resulting string will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence and handles the replacement of characters to achieve this. The output hints also confirm that the code aligns with the problem description.
