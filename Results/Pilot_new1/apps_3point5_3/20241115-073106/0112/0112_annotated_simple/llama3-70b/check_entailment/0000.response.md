Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the constraint that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the program may not generate the correct maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes. An example case where the program would fail is if Masha has the following cubes:

3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

In this case, the program would incorrectly output 98 as the maximum number x, when the correct answer should be 97 since Masha cannot make the number 98 due to the constraint mentioned above.
