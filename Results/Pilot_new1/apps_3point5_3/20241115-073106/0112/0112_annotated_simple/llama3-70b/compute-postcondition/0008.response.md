Example Answer:
The code iterates over each sublist `cube` in the list `cubes`, converts each integer `digit` in `cube` to a string, and adds it to the set `digits`. Since `digits` is a set containing the digits of all cubes in the list `cubes`, after execution, the set `digits` will be updated with the new digits added from the cubes. The values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 3 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from the cubes in the list `cubes`**
