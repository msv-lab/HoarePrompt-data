Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube in the list `cubes` and converts it to a string before adding it to the `digits` set. Since the initial state specifies that `cubes` contains at least 1 cube and `n` is between 1 and 3, the first cube exists and has digits. Therefore, the digits of the first cube are added to the `digits` set. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube**
