According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 2 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 2 cubes. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube**
