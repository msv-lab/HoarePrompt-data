Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function iterates through numbers starting from 1 until it finds a number that cannot be formed using the given cubes. This logic ensures that it finds the maximum number x that can be formed using the cubes.
2. The `can_form_number` function checks if a given number can be formed using the cubes by iterating through the digits of the number and checking if each digit can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit cannot be found, it returns False.
3. The program handles the conditions specified in the problem description, such as not being able to form 6 from 9 and vice versa, and the restriction on leading zeros.
4. The program logic and functions are aligned with the problem requirements and work correctly for the given examples.
