According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:

1. Since the loop iterates over `i` and `i` starts from 0, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1. 
2. If the condition inside the loop body is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` should be set to `True`.
3. If the condition inside the loop body is satisfied, `found` should be set to `True`.
4. If the condition inside the loop body is satisfied, the loop or if statement should be exited.

State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are initially `False`, except for the element `i+1` which becomes `True` if the condition is satisfied. The list `digits` still contains at least 1 digit. The variable `digit` remains as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` is set to `True` if the condition is met. The variable `n` remains greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True` if the condition is satisfied, `found` is set to `True` if the condition is satisfied, and the loop or if statement is exited if the condition is satisfied.**
