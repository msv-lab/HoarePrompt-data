According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more digits left in the list `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, `digits` still contains at least 2 digits, `digit` is the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` still has at least one `True` value, `n` remains greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, the next digit needs to be accessed, so the `digit` variable needs to be updated to the next digit in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`found` is False, `digits` still contains at least 2 digits, `digit` is the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` still has at least one `True` value, `n` remains greater than 0**
