Output State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are initially `False`, except for the element `i+1` which becomes `True` if the condition is satisfied. The list `digits` still contains at least 1 digit. The variable `digit` remains as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` is set to `True`. The variable `n` remains greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True` if the condition is satisfied, `found` is set to `True`, and the loop or if statement is exited if the condition is satisfied.**
