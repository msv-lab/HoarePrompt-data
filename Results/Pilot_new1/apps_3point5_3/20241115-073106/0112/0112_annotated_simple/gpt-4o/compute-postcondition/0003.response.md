Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `used_cubes` are `False`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is `False`.
Output State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are `False`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is `False`**
