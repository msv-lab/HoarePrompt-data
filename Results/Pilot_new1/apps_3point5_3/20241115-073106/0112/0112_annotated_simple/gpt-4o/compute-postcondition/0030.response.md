Output State: **After the loop executes, the variable `used_cubes` will have at least one `True` value if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. The variable `digits` will still contain at least 1 digit. The variable `digit` will remain as the first digit in the list. The variable `found` will be `True` if the condition is met at least once during the loop execution. The variable `n` will remain greater than 0. If the list `used_cubes` is initially all `True` or if the list `cube_faces` is empty, the loop will not execute, leaving all variables unchanged. If `found` is `False`, the function returns False.**
