Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes. It iterates through numbers from 1 to x, checking if each number can be formed using the available cubes. The function `can_form_number` correctly checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes. The program then increments x until a number cannot be formed, and returns the maximum number x. The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
