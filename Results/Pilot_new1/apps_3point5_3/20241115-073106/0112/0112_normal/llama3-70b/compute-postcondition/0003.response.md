According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the digits set is empty. So, for the loop to execute, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube being processed in the loop is the first cube in the list.
State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list**
