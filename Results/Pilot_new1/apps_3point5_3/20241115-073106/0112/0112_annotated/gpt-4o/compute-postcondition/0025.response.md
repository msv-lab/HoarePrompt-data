According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list and the `found` variable. If `found` is True, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is the index of the last iteration. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `found` must remain True and the next digit in the list should be considered.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and the next digit is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, next `digit` in the list, `found` is True, `i+1` is the index of the next iteration**
