According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the element at index `i` set to True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in `used_cubes` is True and `digit` is in the list of faces of the cube at index `i`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to move to the next element in the list and `found` should remain True.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the element at index `i+1` set to True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
