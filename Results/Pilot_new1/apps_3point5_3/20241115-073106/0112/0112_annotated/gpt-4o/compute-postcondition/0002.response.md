According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `False`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `digits` list must have at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all initialized to `False`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
