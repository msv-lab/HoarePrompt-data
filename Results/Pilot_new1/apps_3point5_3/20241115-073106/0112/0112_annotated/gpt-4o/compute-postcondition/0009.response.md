Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the element at index `i` set to True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 0. The element at index `i` in `used_cubes` is True and `digit` is in the list of faces of the cube at index `i. If the condition is not met, the program variables remain unchanged.***
