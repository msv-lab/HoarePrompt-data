According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more digits in the list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, next `digit` in the list, `found` is False, and `i+1` is the index of the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the list should be considered, and `i+1` should be updated to reflect the next iteration index.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, next `digit` in the list, `found` is False, `i+1` is the index of the next iteration**
