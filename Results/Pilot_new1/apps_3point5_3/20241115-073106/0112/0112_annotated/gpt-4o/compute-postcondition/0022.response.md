Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is False, `i` is the index of the last iteration. If the loop does not execute at all, all variables remain unchanged.***
