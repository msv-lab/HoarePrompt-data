According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 2 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, cube is the first cube in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 cubes and the cube variable should move to the second cube in the list.
State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the first cube in string format, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `cube` is the second cube in the list**
