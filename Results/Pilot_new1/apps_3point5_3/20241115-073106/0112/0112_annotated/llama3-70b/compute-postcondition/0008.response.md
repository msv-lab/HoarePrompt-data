Example Answer:
The code snippet updates the set `digits` by adding the individual digits of the third cube in the list `cubes`. Since `digits` initially contains the individual digits of both cubes, the set will now also include the digits of the third cube. 
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of all three cubes, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, `cube` is the third cube in the list**
