Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly simulates the voting process described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and iterates through the votes to add employees to their respective queues. It then processes the votes by comparing the indices of the employees in the queues and moves them to the back of the queue if necessary. Finally, it checks which queue still has employees remaining and prints the outcome accordingly. The logic of denying the right to vote to employees based on the order of their statements is correctly implemented.
