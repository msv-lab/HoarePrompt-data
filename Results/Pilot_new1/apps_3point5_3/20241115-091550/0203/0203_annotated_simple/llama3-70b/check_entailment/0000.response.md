Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It counts the number of 'D' and non-'D' fractions and then compares them to determine the outcome of the vote. The loop iterates over each employee's fraction and increments the corresponding count, accurately reflecting the state of the fractions. The if-else block then correctly prints 'D' if depublicans have more votes and 'R' if remocrats have more votes. 
For all potential cases and inputs, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct outcome.
