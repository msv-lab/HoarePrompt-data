The function `func` takes user input for an integer `n` and a string `fractions` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and non-'D' fractions in the input string. After that, it compares the counts of 'D' and non-'D' fractions. If the count of 'D' fractions is greater, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not return any value.
