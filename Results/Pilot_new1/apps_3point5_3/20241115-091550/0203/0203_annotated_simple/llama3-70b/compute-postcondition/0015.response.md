Example Answer:
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, but it represents the count of 'D' fractions. After execution, `depublicans` will have an increased count of 'D' fractions. The state of `remocrats` is not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is an increased count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` is an integer representing the count of non-'D' fractions.**
