According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
1. `d_queue` should not be empty.
2. `r_queue` should not be empty.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index, r_index, d_queue, r_queue are updated as described above.**
