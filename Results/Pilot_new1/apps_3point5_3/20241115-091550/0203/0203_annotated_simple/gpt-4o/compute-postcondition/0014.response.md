According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `votes` string. If there are more characters left in the `votes` string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, d_queue and r_queue are updated based on the first character of `votes`. To execute the loop one more time, the length of `votes` should be greater than the current index i. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1, d_queue and r_queue are updated, i+1 is appended to d_queue or r_queue**
