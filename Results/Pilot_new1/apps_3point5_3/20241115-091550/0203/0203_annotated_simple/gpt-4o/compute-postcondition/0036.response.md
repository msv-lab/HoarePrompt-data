Example Answer: 
The code appends d_index + n to d_queue. The initial state mentions that d_queue is not empty, so after appending the new value, d_queue will still not be empty. The other variables such as n, votes, d_index, r_index, and r_queue remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated based on the value popped from d_queue, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n if d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, d_queue and r_queue are not empty, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_index is updated based on the value popped from d_queue, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n if d_index is less than r_index, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n if d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, d_queue and r_queue are not empty, r_index is updated by removing the first element from r_queue**
