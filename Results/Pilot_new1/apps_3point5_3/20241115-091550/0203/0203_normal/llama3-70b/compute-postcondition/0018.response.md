According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `fractions`. If the list has at least 4 fractions, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` contains at least 3 fractions, and `fraction` is the third fraction in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 fractions and `fraction` is the fourth fraction in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. The list `fractions` contains at least 4 fractions, and `fraction` is the fourth fraction in the list.**
