According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `d_index` and `r_index` have been popped from their respective queues. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` is appended with `r_index + n`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` should be appended with `d_index + n`.
2. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` should be appended with `r_index + n`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty**
