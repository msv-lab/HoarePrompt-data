Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list**
