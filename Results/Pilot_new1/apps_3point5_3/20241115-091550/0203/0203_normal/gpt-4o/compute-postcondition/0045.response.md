Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is not empty, the program prints 'D'. Otherwise, the program prints 'R'. In either case, after the execution of the if-else block, the values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated based on the popped values from the queues. If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are both empty, it indicates that there are no 'D' or 'R' characters in `votes` respectively. The state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block will depend on the contents of `votes` and the comparisons between `d_index` and `r_index`, potentially resulting in different lengths of `d_queue` and `r_queue`.***
