Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly processes the votes, assigns indices to the 'D' and 'R' queues, and simulates the voting process until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining. The comparison of indices between the 'D' and 'R' queues determines the winning party, and the code prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty (indicating a Democrat win) or 'R' if the 'R' queue is not empty (indicating a Republican win). The code handles all scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given examples.
