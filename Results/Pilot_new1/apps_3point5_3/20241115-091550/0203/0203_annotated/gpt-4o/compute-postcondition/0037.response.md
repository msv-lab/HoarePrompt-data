Example Answer:
`r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n` to itself. The previous values of `r_queue`, `r_index`, and `n` are not provided, so the output state is: `votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is appended with a new value, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` is updated with the front value removed.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is appended with a new value, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` is updated with the front value removed**
