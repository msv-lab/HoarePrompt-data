Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. The `votes` string remains unchanged, `d_queue` now contains the appended index `i`, `r_queue` remains the same, and `v` remains the same as the next character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input with length greater than the current index `i`, `d_queue` contains the appended index `i`, `r_queue` remains the same, `i` is the next index, `v` is the next character in the `votes` string**
