Example Answer:
The value `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_queue`, `d_queue`, and `votes` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index. The index of 'D' is not less than the index of other characters in `votes`.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index. The index of 'D' is not less than the index of other characters in `votes`.**
