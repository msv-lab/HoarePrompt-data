Postcondition: ***`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is either appended with `d_index + n` if `d_index < r_index` or with `r_index + n` if `d_index >= r_index`, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` is updated with the front value removed. The program handles all edge cases where `d_index` is less than `r_index`, equal to `r_index`, or greater than `r_index` appropriately, ensuring the correct update of queues and indices.***
