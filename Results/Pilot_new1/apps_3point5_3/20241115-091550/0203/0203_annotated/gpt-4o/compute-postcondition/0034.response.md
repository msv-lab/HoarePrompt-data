Example Answer:
The value at the front of the `d_queue` is removed and assigned to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is not empty, the front value is successfully removed and assigned to `d_index`. The states of `votes`, `r_queue`, and `r_index` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` remains the same.
Output State: **`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is updated with the front value removed, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is updated accordingly, and `r_index` remains the same**
