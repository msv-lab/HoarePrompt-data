Example Answer:
The variable `balance` is assigned the result of subtracting `cnt1` from `cnt0`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s` respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is T-1 + 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in string `s` respectively, `balance` is the result of count of '0' - count of '1'.
Output State: **`T` is T-1 + 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in string `s` respectively, `balance` is the result of count of '0' - count of '1'**
