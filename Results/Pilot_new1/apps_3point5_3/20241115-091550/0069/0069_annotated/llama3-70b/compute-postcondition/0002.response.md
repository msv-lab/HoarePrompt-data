Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `n` and `x` are dependent on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input**
