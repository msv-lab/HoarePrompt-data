Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. 

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
1
2 0
01

Expected Output:
-1

Explanation:
For the input "2 0" with string "01", the expected output is -1 since there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance equal to 0. However, the program will output 0 instead of -1 for this case. 

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance.
