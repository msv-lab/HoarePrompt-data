Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If balance is 0 and x is in prefix_balances, then -1 is appended to the results list. If x is not in prefix_balances, then 0 is appended to the results list. In the else part, count represents the updated value after the loop iteration, and results contain the appended value of count.**
