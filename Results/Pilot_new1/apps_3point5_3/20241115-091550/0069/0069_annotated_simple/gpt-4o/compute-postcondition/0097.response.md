Postcondition: ***`balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition where `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1). If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and the initial state variables remain unchanged. Additionally, `balance` is equal to 0 and x is not in prefix_balances***
