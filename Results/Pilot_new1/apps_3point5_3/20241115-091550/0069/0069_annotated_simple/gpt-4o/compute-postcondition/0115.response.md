Postcondition: ***`balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition where `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the initial state variables remain unchanged. If `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then `0` is appended to `results`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is an integer that increases by 1 for each iteration where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true. The program covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the integrity of the variables and their relationships throughout the execution of the if-else block. `results` will contain the appended values of `count` after the if-else block completes its execution.***
