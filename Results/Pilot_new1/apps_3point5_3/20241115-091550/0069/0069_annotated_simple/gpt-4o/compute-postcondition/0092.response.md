According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to `i` is 4.
State: **`balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition**
