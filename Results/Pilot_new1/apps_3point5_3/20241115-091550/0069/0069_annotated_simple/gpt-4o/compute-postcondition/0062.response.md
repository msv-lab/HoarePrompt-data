Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop has executed and calculated the prefix balances based on the values in the string s. The prefix_balances array has been updated with each iteration. If n is less than 1, the loop did not execute. Additionally, the balance is equal to 0. If x is in the prefix_balances array, the results array has appended -1. If x is not in the prefix_balances array, the results array has appended 0.***
