Postcondition: ***`balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is an integer that has been increased by 1 if both `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true. `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is between 1 and `n`, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated according to the given formula. This condition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases when the if statement is executed.***
