Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is unknown, so the value of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`**
