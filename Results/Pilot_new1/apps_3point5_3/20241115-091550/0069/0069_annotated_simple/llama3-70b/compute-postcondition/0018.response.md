Example Answer: 
The variables cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' characters in the string s, respectively. The previous values of cnt0, cnt1, and balance are unknown, but the counts are calculated based on the input string s. Therefore, the Output State is: T is the previous value + 1, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' characters in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' characters in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1.
Output State: **T is the previous value + 1, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, s is the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' characters in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' characters in the string s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1**
