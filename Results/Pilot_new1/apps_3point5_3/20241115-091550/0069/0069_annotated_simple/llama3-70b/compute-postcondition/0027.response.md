Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the input value. The previous values of the affected variables are T is the previous value + 2, n and x are input integers, s, cnt0, cnt1, and balance are input values with specific characteristics. Therefore, the Output State is: T is the previous value + 2, n and x are input integers, `s` is the input value, cnt0, cnt1, and balance are input values with specific characteristics.
Output State: **T is the previous value + 2, n and x are input integers, `s` is the input value, cnt0, cnt1, and balance are input values with specific characteristics**
