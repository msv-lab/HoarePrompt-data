Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n and x are input integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, and balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in s. If balance is equal to x, the program outputs n + 1. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is 0, the program outputs -1. Otherwise, if ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is not 0, the program outputs ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block, ensuring the correct output based on the given conditions.***
