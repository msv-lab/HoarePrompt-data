Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `n` and `x` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers**
