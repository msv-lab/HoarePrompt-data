Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3 for each iteration, `results` contains either -1 or 0 based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `balance` is 0, `prefix_balances` contains updated values, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the string value of `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `count` is incremented by 1, and the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied**
