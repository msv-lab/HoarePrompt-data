Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, index is incremented by 7, results contains either -1 or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances, x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 1], balance is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string s, prefix_balances contains updated values, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n + 1, n is assigned the integer value of data[index + 3], x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 4], s is assigned the string value of data[index + 5], prefix_balances is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, n is assigned the integer value of data[index], x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 1], s is assigned the string value of data[index + 2], balance is calculated as s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1**
