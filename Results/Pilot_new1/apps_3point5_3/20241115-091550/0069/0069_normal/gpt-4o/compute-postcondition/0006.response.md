Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list, and `index` is 0. Since `data` is not provided, the value of `n` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 0, results is an empty list.
Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 0, results is an empty list**
