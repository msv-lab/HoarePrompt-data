Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is incremented by 3 for each iteration, results contains either -1 or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances, x is assigned the integer value of data[1], balance is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string s, prefix_balances contains updated values, n is greater than 0, i is equal to n, n is assigned the integer value of data[index], x is assigned the integer value of data[index + 1], s is assigned the string value of data[index + 2], and prefix_balances is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of n + 1. If n is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and the values of the variables remain the same as the initial state. `results` list now contains an additional `0`.**
