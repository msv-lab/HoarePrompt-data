Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `count` is incremented by 1. The condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied**
