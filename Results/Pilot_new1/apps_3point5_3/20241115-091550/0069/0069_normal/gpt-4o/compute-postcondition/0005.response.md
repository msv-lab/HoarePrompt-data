According to the code, the loop will execute T times where T is a positive integer. So, to ensure the loop executes, the value of T must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, index is 1 and results is an empty list. For the loop to execute, the index should be 0 (as the loop variable `_` does not affect the loop execution) and the results list should still be empty.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 0, results is an empty list**
