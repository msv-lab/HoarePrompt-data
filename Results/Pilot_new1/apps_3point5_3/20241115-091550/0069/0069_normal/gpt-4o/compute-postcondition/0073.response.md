Output State: **`T` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3, `results` still contains either -1 or 0, `x` remains in `prefix_balances`, `balance` remains 0, `prefix_balances` still contains updated values, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` retains the integer value of `data[index + 3]`, `x` retains the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, `s` retains the string value of `data[index + 5]`, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied.**
