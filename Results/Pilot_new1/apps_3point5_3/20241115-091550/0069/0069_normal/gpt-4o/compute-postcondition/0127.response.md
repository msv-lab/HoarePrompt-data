Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data from the standard input, processes it based on certain conditions, and prints the results. It iterates T times, where T is a positive integer, extracting values for n, x, and s from the input data. It then calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string s, computes prefix balances, and evaluates conditions to determine the count of valid cases. The function prints the results after processing each set of values. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
