Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `index` remains 3, `results` contains either -1 or 0 based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `balance` is 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values based on the formula, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is equal to n. If `balance` is 0, `results` appends -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise 0 is appended. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is initialized to 0. For each element `b` in `prefix_balances`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. The final `results` list contains the count of elements meeting the conditions.***
