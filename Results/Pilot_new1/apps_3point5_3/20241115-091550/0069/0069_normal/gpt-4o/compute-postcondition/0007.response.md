Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Since `index` is 0, `data[index + 1]` refers to the second element of the `data` list. The value of `x` will depend on the value at index 1 of the `data` list. The `results` list and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 0, results is an empty list, x is assigned the integer value of data[1].
Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, index is 0, results is an empty list, x is assigned the integer value of data[1]**
