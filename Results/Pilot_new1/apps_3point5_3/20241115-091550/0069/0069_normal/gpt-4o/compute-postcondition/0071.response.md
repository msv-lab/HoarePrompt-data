Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 3 for each iteration, `results` still contains either -1 or 0 based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `x` remains in `prefix_balances`, `balance` remains 0, `prefix_balances` still contains updated values with more elements, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is still equal to `n`, `n` retains the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` retains the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` retains the string value of `data[index + 2]`, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied.***
