According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `i`, `remainder` are integers. If `remainder` is in the list `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `remainder`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k`.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i` (adjusted to be less than the original value), `remainder` are integers**
