The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables n and k.

Case 2: 
- If `n` is 0 or `k` is 0, the loop won't execute. In this case, `remainder` is not defined, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.
- If the loop executes, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders encountered during the loop iterations. `i` decreases in each iteration, and the loop stops when `i` is less than the original value of `k`.

Case 3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No', 'Yes', or maintain the state of the variables n and k.
