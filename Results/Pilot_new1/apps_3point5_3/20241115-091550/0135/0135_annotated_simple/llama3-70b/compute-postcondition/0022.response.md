Output State: **The loop checks if there are any repeated remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, 'No' is printed and the program exits. If no repeated remainders are found, the remainders are added to the set seen. If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute.**
