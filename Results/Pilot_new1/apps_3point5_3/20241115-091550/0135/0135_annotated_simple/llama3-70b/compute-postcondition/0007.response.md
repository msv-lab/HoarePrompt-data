Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1. `seen` is a set containing the remainder values of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` from 1 to `k-1`. `i` is equal to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `k`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits.***
