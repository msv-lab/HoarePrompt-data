Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if all the remainders obtained by dividing n by numbers from 1 to k are distinct. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it prints "Yes". The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs within the given constraints.
