Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It checks if all the remainders are distinct by keeping track of the remainders in a set and returning "No" if a duplicate remainder is found. The program covers all potential cases where the remainders might not be distinct and returns the correct output accordingly. The program also handles the edge case where k is greater than or equal to n.
