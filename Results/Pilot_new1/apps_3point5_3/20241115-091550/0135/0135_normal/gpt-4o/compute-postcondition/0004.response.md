According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to k inclusive. Since k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, the loop will definitely execute. Before the loop starts, the set `seen_remainders` is empty. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. Additionally, `i` should be set to 1 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
