According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainders seen so far, `i` is 3, `remainder` is a value between 0 and 1**
