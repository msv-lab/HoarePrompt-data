Output State: **The values of `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are updated based on the locations of `a` and `b`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
