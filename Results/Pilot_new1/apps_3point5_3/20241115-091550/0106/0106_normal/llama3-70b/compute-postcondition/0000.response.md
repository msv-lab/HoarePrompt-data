Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and a ≠ b**
