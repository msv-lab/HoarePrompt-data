Example Answer:
`floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1. The value of `floor_within_block` is determined by the formula `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. Therefore, the Output State is: `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`.
Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`**
