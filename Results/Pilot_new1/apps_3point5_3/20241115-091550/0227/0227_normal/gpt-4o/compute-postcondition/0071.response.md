Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, a list of distinct positive integers. It sorts the list `a`, then iterates through the elements to check if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the list that are already assigned. If an element cannot be formed, the counter `m` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of times `can_form` was False during the iteration.**
