According to the code, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `m` is an integer. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the element at index `i-1`, `m` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n+1` as the loop is currently iterating from 1 to n exclusive. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer**.
