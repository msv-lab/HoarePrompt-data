According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `m` is an integer that gets incremented under certain conditions. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n` which means `i` should be less than or equal to `n-1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer**
