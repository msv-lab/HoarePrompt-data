Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and sorts them. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to check if each element is double the previous element. If it is not, it increments the variable m indicating the minimum number of variables required. Finally, it prints the value of m unless it exceeds 23, in which case it prints -1. The logic used in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, ensuring that the minimum number of variables required is calculated correctly.
