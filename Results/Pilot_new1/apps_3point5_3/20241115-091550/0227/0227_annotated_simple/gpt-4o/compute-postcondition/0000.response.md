Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since `a` is a list of distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in ascending order. The length of the list `a` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers with length n. a is sorted in ascending order.**
Output State: **Precondition: n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers with length n. a is sorted in ascending order.**
