Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct positive integers with a length of `n`. It sorts the list `a`, then iterates through the elements to determine if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the list. If an element cannot be formed in this way, the counter `m` is incremented. The function returns the final value of `m` after the loop execution. **
