Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in the `assigned` list with more elements to iterate over, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop is broken. All initial conditions are maintained.***
