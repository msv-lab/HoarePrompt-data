Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` along with the new element `a[i+1]`, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, `m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `can_form` is True. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
