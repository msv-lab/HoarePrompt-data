Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the input sequence and keeps track of the elements that have been assigned to variables. If an element can be formed by adding two previously assigned elements, it continues with the same number of variables. If not, it increments the variable count. The program then returns the minimum number of variables required. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
