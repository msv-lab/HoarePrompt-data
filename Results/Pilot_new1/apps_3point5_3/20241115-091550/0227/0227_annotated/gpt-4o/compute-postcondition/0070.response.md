The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, which is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9). After executing the function body, the program returns the number of elements in list 'a' that cannot be formed as the difference of any two elements in the 'assigned' set. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of elements in list 'a' that cannot be formed as the difference of any two elements in the 'assigned' set. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of distinct positive integers a, returns the count of elements in list 'a' that cannot be formed as the difference of any two elements in the 'assigned' set.**
