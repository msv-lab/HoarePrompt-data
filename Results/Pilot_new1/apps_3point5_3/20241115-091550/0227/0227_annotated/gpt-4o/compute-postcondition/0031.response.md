Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `assigned` is a list of at least 1 element, `m` is incremented by 1, `can_form` is a boolean value. If the element at index `i` of list `a` minus `x` is found in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
