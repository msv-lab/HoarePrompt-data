Functionality: **The function reads an integer n and a list of n distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list and iterates through the elements, incrementing a counter m if an element is not twice the previous element. Finally, it prints m if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function calculates and returns the sum of distinct positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} with specific conditions on the increment of m. However, the function does not handle cases where n is less than 1 or where the input list is not sorted in ascending order.**
