Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the elements in `a` are distinct positive integers, sorting them will rearrange the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
