Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is not in the keys initialized to 0. After executing `window_counts[color] += 1`, the value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. All values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after the if condition is met.***
