Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that indicates if all counts of colors in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` after sorting. If this condition is met, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains False. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color is properly updated, and `color` is the color at index `j`. After the execution of the if statement, the program will exit the innermost loop or condition based on the value of `found`. If `found` is True, the loop breaks. If `found` is False, the loop continues its execution.***
