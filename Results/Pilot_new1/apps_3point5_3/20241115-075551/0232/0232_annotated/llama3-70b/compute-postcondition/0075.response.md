Example Answer:
The value of `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is a boolean variable, `n`, `i`, `j+1`, `window_counts` is set to 0 for `color`, and `color` maintains its initial condition.
Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable, `n`, `i`, `j+1`, `window_counts` is set to 0 for `color`, and `color` maintains its initial condition**
