Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`, where `color` is a key in the dictionary. The dictionary `color_counts` is updated with the new key-value pair. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an input integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of integers representing the colors of lightsabers of the Jedi Knights with at least 1 color, `color_counts` is a dictionary where the color is not already present and `color_counts[color]` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an input integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of integers representing the colors of lightsabers of the Jedi Knights with at least 1 color, `color_counts` is a dictionary where the color is not already present and `color_counts[color]` is 0**
