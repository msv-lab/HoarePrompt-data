According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `found` being False does not affect the loop execution. The `window_counts` being an empty dictionary does not impact the loop execution either. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i`.
State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is equal to `i`**
