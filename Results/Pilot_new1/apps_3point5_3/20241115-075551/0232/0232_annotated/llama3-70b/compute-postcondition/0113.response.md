Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `color`, and `window_counts` maintain their initial conditions. If the condition is not met, the program continues without altering the variables.***
