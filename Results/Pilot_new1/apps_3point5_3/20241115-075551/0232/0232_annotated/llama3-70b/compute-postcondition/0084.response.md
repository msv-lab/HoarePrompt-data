Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable that indicates if all counts of colors in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts` after sorting. If this condition is met, `found` is set to True. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color is properly updated, and `color` is the color at index `j`. The loop or if statement breaks and the program exits the innermost loop or condition.**
