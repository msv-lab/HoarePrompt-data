Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is an input integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of integers representing the colors of lightsabers of the Jedi Knights with at least 1 color, `color_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then after the execution of the if statement, `color_counts[color]` is set to 0. This accounts for the scenario where a new color is encountered and initialized to 0 in the dictionary.***
