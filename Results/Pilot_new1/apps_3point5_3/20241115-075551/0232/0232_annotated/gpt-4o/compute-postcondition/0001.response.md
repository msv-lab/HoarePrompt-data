Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with integer values. This means that `current_counts` will store integer values for each color key. The initial state of other variables remains the same.
Output State: **colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights, k is a list of m integers representing desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, the sum of elements in k is at least 1 and at most n, and desired_counts is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values**
