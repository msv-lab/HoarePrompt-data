Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the values in `current_counts` for at least one color are less than the corresponding values in `desired_counts`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
