Example Answer:
The value of `colors[right]` is used as a key to increment the value in `current_counts` by 1. The variables `desired_counts`, `left`, and `n` are not affected by this operation. The output state is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
