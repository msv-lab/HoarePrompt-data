Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, window_counts will store the count of each color encountered, i and n will remain unchanged, color will be assigned the value of colors[j], colors[j] will be added to window_counts if not already present, and the values will be incremented by 1. The contents of window_counts will be sorted and compared to the counts list. If all counts in window_counts match their corresponding targets in counts, the variable found will be set to True. If the loop does not execute, window_counts will remain an empty dictionary, and found will be False.***
