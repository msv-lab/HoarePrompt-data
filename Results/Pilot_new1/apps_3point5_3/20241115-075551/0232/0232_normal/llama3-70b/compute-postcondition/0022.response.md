According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the initial state should be adjusted to `i` is less than `n` and `j` is equal to `i`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `colors` is not empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary initialized with 0 counts for each color, `found` is `False`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`**
