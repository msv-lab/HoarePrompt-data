Example Answer:
`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i`. The value of `colors[i]` is assigned to `color`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is still greater than 0, `colors` remains non-empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is still greater than 0, `colors` remains non-empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]**
