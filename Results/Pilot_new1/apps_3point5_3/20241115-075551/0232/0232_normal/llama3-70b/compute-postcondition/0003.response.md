Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
