Output State: **If `colors` is not empty, the loop will iterate through each color in `colors` and update the `color_counts` dictionary with the count of each color. If a color is not present in `color_counts`, it will be added with a count of 0. If `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. `found` is assigned the value `False`.**
