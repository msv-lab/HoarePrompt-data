Output State: **If `found` is True, then all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts` after sorting. The loop breaks after this condition is met or j reaches n. If color is not in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if colors is an empty list or if n is less than or equal to i.**
