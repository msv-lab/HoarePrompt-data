Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `colors` is not empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary initialized with 0 counts for each color, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` count is increased by 1 if `color` is in `window_counts`. The count of each color in `window_counts` matches the corresponding target count in `counts` after sorting.***
