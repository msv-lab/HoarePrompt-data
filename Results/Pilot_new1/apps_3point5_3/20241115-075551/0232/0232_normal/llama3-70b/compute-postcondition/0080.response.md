Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, colors is non-empty, color_counts is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, window_counts[color] is either incremented by 1 or initialized to 0 if color was not in window_counts, found remains True if all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts after sorting, j is less than n. If all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts after sorting, found is set to True and the loop breaks.***
