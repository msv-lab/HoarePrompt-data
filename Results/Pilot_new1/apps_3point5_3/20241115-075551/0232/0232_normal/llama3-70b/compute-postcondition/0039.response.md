Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `n` is still greater than 0, `colors` remains non-empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, `found` remains True, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of `color` is increased by 1 if `color` is in `window_counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j] and if `color` was not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated with the count of `color` set to 1. The if statement checks if all counts in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts`. If this condition is met, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and states of the variables after the if statement executes.***
