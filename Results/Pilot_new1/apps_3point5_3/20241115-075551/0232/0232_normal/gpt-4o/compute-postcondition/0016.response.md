According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has terminated, so `right` will be equal to or greater than `n`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, the value of `right` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`.
State: **If all colors in desired_counts have their counts matching the counts in current_counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return 'YES'. The values of left and right are such that the loop has terminated, right is less than n**
