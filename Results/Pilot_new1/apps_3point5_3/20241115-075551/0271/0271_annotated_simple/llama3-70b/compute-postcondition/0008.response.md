Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer where the last digit of n is not 0. If the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n minus the last digit of n. If the last digit of n is greater than 5, the program prints n plus the difference between 10 and the last digit of n, resulting in a multiple of 10.***
