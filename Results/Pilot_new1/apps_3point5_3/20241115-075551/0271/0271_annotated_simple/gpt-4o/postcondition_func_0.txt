The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user and calculates `result` based on the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, `result` is `n` minus the remainder; otherwise, `result` is `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the calculated `result`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
