Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n` as it is already rounded. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by removing the last digit. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it rounds up by replacing the last digit with the next multiple of 10. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
