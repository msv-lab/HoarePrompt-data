Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. If the function is_valid_number(candidate, sub) returns true, then the function yields the value of `candidate`. If `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no candidates are yielded.**
