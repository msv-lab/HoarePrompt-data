Functionality: ** The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a sequence of digits, and `sub`, a string representing a substring of n. It iterates over all permutations of `chars`, forms a candidate string, and checks if it is a valid number by calling the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If the check is successful, it yields the candidate string. If either `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. The function does not have a specified return value provided in the given information.**
