According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to be generated. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation `perm` needs to be generated, so the state that needs to be adjusted is the next permutation `perm`.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`.**
