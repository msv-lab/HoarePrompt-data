Example Answer:
The variable `t_set` is assigned the set of characters in the string `t`. The previous values of `t` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s` which can contain leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`.**
Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s` which can contain leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`**
