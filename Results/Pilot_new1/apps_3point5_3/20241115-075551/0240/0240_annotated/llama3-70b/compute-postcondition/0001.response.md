Example Answer:
`n` is assigned an empty string. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s` which can contain leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s` which can contain leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`, `n` is an empty string**
