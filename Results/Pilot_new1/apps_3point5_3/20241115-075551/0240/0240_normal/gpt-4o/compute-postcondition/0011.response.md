Example Answer:
The code snippet `yield candidate` yields the value of `candidate` as the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub`. The values of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub**
