Example Answer:
The next permutation of `chars` is generated and stored in `candidate`. The result is yielded, which means it is returned as the output. The states of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`**
