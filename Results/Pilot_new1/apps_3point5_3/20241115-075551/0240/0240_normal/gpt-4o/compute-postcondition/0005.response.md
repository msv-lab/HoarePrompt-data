According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars`, `sub`, `candidate`, and the result of the `is_valid_number` function. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining `perm`. To execute the loop one more time, the next `perm` needs to be generated. Therefore, `perm` needs to be adjusted to the next permutation of `chars`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`**
