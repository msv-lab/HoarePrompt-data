Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes the input string `s` and the remembered substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to construct the smallest integer `n` by appending only the characters present in `t`. Finally, it appends the remembered substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. The program follows the problem description accurately, as it constructs the smallest possible integer `n` based on the remembered substring `t`. All the provided examples work correctly as well.
