Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` after joining the characters together. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be a string representing the first permutation of the characters in `chars`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of the characters in `chars`**
