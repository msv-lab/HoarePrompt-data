Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` string, which represents the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. The values of `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is the string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is the string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
