According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s` and the characters in `t_set`. If there are more characters left in `s` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` needs to be the next character in the string `s`, and `n` should be updated accordingly based on the presence of `c` in `t_set`.

State: **`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`.**
