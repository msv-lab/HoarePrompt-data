Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` in string `s` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program checks for palindrome property of the string `s` and updates the flag `is_spalindrome` accordingly.***
