`n` is assigned the length of `s`, which can be any value between 1 and 1000 based on the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`**
