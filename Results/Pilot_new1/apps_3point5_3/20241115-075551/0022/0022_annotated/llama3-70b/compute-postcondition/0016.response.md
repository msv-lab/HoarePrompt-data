According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 5, and `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 5, `i` is less than `n // 2`.**
