Postcondition: ***`s` is the input string provided by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited. This ensures that the program maintains the initial conditions and properly handles the comparison of characters in the string for palindrome checking, updating the `is_spalindrome` flag accordingly.***
