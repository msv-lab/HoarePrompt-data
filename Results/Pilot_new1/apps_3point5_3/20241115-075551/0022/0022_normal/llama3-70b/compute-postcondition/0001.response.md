Example Answer:
The length of the input string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function and assigned to variable `n`. The value of `n` is determined based on the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is the input string provided by the user, `n` is the length of the input string `s`**
