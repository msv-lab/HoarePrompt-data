Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It takes three integers as input representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or unknown. It then compares these values to determine the result of the voting process (+, -, 0, or ?) according to the rules specified in the problem description.

The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description:
1. If there are more upvotes than downvotes, it prints "+"
2. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, it prints "-"
3. If the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes and the unknown persons are 0, it prints "0"
4. If the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes and the unknown persons are not 0, it prints "?"
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it also prints "?"

The annotations provide additional insights into the logic of the code, confirming that it handles all possible scenarios within the specified constraints. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for all cases.
