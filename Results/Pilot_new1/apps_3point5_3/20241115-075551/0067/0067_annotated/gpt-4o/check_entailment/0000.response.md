Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The program only considers two scenarios: if `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints '-', and if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints '+'. However, the program does not cover the case when the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes, resulting in an output of '?'. This is a potential case that the program does not handle correctly, making the correctness of the program false.

The annotations also mention that there are two possible results when the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes, which aligns with the problem description. This discrepancy between the program's logic and the problem description is a clear indication of its incorrectness.
