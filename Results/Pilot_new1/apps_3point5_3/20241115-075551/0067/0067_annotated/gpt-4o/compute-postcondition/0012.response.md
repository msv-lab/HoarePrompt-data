Postcondition: ***`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is between 0 and 200; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false. After the execution of the if-else block, the program will print either '+' if max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes or '?' if max_downvotes is equal to or greater than min_upvotes. All variables retain their initial values and relationships.***
