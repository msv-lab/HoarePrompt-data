Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- For the first example (3 7 0), if there are 3 upvotes and 7 downvotes, the result will definitely be "-". The program correctly outputs "-".
- For the second example (2 0 1), no matter if the unknown person upvotes or downvotes, there will be more upvotes than downvotes. The program correctly outputs "+".
- For the third example (1 1 0), with 1 upvote and 1 downvote, the result will be "0". The program correctly outputs "0".
- For the fourth example (0 0 1), if the unknown person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise it would be "-". Since there are two possible results, the program correctly outputs "?".
