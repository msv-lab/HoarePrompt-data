Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input. It then checks various conditions based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` equals `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0' in that case, otherwise it prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, it prints '?'. The function does not have any specified return value.**
