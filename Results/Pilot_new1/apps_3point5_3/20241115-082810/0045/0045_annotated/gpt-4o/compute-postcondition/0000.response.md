Example Answer:
`min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` will be the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`**
