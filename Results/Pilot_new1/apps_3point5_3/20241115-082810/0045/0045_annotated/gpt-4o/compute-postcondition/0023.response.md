According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `k`, `i`, and `remainder`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 2`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be decremented by 1, so it becomes `k - 3`.
- If `remainder` is not 0, then `sequence[i]` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (k - 2 + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 3`.**
