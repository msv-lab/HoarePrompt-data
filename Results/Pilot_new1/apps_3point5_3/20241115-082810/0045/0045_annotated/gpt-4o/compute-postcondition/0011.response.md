Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. If the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` is 0, then the program breaks out of the loop.**
