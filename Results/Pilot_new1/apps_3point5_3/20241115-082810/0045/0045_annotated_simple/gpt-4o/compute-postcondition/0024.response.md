Output State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`. `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. If `k` is greater than 0 and `remainder` is not equal to 0 after the loop execution, then `sequence` will have some elements incremented by 1 based on the value of `remainder` and the loop logic. If `k` is 0 or less, or `remainder` is 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute and the state remains the same as the initial state.**
