According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k-1`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k-2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_sum` is greater than `n`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-2`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
