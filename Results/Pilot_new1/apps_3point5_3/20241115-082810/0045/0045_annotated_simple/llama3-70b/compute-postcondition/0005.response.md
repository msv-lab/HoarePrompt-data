According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is the new value of `b` and `b` is the new value of `a` modulo the new value of `b`. For the loop to be executed one more time, the new value of `b` must not be equal to 0.
State: **`a` is the new value of `b`, `b` is the new value of `a` modulo the new value of `b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
