According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is not less than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, and `k` is at least 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `k - 1`, so `i` should be equal to `k - 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`, where `k` is at least 1, `sequence` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, and `remainder` is equal to -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
