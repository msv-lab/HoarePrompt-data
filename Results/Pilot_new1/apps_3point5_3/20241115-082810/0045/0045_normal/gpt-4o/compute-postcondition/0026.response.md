The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition is that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, the function calculates `min_sum` as k * (k + 1) // 2 based on the given constraints. If `min_sum` is greater than n, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

In Case 2, the program returns the updated list 'sequence' after the loop execution. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate `min_sum` based on the constraints, and return -1 if `min_sum` is greater than n. Otherwise, it returns the updated list 'sequence' after the loop execution.
