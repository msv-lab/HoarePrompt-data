The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates `min_sum` as k * (k + 1) // 2 based on the given constraints. If `min_sum` is greater than n, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it generates a list `sequence` containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`. The function then adjusts the elements in `sequence` based on the remainder of n divided by `min_sum`. The final output is the updated list 'sequence' after the adjustments.
