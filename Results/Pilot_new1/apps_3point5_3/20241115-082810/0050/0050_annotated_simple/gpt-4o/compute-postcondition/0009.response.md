Example Answer: 
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The value of `r` is a positive integer, and `min_buy_price` is also a positive integer. Therefore, `remaining_bourles` will have a value within the range of 0 to `min_buy_price - 1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_sell_price` is larger than `min_buy_price`, `max_shares` is an integer calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is a non-negative integer less than `min_buy_price`**
