Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated according to the formula r += shares * b[i], `i` is 2, `shares` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, r is updated by adding the product of shares and b[i], and shares is then set to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
