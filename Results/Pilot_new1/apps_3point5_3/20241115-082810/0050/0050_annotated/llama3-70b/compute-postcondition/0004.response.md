Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order. The sorting operation changes the order of elements in the list `b`, but the values remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers from user input sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers from user input sorted in descending order**
