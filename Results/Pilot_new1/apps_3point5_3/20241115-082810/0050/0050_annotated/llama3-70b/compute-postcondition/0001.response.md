Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted into a list of integers assigned to variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a list of integers**
