Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is assigned the value 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from user input sorted in descending order, and `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from user input sorted in descending order, and `shares` is 0**
