Example Answer:
The variable `shares` is initialized to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on the formula, `i` is 1, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on the formula, `i` is 1, `shares` is 0**
