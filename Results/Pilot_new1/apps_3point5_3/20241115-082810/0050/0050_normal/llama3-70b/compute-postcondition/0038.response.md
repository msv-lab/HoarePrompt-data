Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous values of `r`, `shares`, and `i` are known, so the new value of `r` can be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `r` is calculated based on the previous values.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and the new value of `r` is calculated based on the previous values**
