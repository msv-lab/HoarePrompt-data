Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated to the sum of its current value and the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
