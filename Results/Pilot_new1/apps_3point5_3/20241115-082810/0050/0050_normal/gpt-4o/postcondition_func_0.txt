The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as lists of integers for `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial investment `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining amount of money after buying those shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. The function then prints the total amount of money. The postcondition describes the comparison between buy and sell prices, ensuring the correct output in different scenarios.
