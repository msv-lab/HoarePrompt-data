Example Answer:
The variable `min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value of the list `s`. The values in `s` are contained in variable `b`, which contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string. Therefore, the minimum value of `s` is the minimum value of `b`. The output state is: `b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`**
