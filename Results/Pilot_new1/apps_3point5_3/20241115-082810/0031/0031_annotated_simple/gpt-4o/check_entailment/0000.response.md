Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions, `func_1` to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers and `func_2` to calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. The `func_2` function correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday by iterating through the number of people and days in Udayland.
4. The program handles the case where the number of people to be interviewed is greater than the total days in Udayland by printing 1 1 and returning.
5. The program correctly calculates the probability values A and B, reduces them to their coprime form, and prints the values modulo 10^6 + 3.
6. The program logic aligns with the problem description and provides the expected output for the given examples.
7. Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
