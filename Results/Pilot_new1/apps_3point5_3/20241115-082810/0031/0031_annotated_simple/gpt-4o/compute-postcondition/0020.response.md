Example Answer:
`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, but the values of `p_no_shared`, `numerator`, and `k` are not mentioned in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.
Output State: **`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`**
