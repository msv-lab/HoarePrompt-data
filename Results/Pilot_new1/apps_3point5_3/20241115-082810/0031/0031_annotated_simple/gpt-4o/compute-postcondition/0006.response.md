Example Answer: 
`numerator` is assigned the value 1. The values of `MOD` and `total_days` are not affected, so the output state is: MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is assigned the value 1.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value 2 raised to the power of n, numerator is assigned the value 1**
