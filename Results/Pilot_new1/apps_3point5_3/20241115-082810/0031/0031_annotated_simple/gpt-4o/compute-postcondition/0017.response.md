According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value 4, numerator is updated to a new value calculated by multiplying the current value of numerator with 2 and then taking the modulo MOD, denominator is updated to a new value calculated by multiplying the current value of denominator with 4 and then taking the modulo MOD, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3**
