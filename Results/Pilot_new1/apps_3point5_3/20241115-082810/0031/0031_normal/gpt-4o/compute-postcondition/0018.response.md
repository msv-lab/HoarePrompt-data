Output State: **If k is greater than 0, then after the loop executes, MOD remains 1000003, numerator is the product of (total_days - k + 1) to (total_days - 1), denominator is the product of 1 to total_days, i is k - 1. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and numerator remains 1, denominator remains 1, i is 0.**
