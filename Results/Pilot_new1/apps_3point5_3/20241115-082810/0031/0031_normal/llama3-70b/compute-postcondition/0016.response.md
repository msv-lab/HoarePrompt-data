Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by performing floor division with `gcd`. The previous values of `denominator` and `gcd` are unknown, so the output state is: `numerator` and `denominator` values are adjusted based on the conditions, and `numerator` is updated after division by `gcd`.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values are adjusted based on the conditions, and `numerator` is updated after division by `gcd`**
