Example Answer: 
The value of `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, which is calculated based on the given formula. The variables `p_no_shared` and `p_total` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, and `A` is assigned the calculated value of `p_shared`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the calculated value of `p_shared`**
