Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing any leading zeros. If `a` is empty, `a` is set to '0' and `b` is unchanged. If `b` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is less than `b`.**
