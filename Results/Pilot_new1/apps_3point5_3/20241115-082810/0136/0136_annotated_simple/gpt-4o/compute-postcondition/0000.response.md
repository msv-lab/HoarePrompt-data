Example Answer:
The input is split and stored in the list `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are unknown at this point. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, stored in the list `data`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, stored in the list `data`**
