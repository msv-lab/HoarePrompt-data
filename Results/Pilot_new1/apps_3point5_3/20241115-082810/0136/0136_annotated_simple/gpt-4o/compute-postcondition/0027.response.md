Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers as strings, removes leading zeros, compares them, and prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if the first number is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If the input strings are empty, they are considered as '0'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific output.**
