Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input string after stripping leading zeros. The input string is a non-negative integer represented as a string, so after stripping leading zeros, the value of `a` remains the same as the input string. The variable `b` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits**
