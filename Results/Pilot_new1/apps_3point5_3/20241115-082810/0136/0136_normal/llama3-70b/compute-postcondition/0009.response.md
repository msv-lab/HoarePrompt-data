Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, but they are not equal to each other. If the integer value represented by string `a` is less than the integer value represented by string `b`, then the program prints '<'. Otherwise, if the integer value represented by string `a` is greater than or equal to the integer value represented by string `b`, the program prints '>'.***
