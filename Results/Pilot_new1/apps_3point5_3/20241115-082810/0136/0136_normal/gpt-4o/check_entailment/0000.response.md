Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, each with at most 10^6 digits. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=' if they are equal. The code correctly handles comparisons between `a` and `b` based on their lengths and values. The code also accounts for cases where `a` or `b` is an empty string by treating it as '0'. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
