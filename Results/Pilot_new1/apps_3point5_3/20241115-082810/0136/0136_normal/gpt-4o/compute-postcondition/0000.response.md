Example Answer:
The input is split and stored in the list `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits.**.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits.**
