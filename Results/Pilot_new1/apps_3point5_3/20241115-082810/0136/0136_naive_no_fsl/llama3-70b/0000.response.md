Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them as per the problem description. It then correctly prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The logic in the program is sound and covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the program handles the input of very large numbers efficiently by reading the entire line at once.
