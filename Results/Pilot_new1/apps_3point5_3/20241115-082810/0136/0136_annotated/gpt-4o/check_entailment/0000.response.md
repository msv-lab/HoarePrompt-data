Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If they are equal, it prints '='. The code also handles edge cases where `a` or `b` are empty strings by updating them to '0'. The comparison is accurate in all cases, including when `a` and `b` are both '0'. The annotations accurately describe the code's behavior, and there are no examples provided where the code does not work as expected in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
