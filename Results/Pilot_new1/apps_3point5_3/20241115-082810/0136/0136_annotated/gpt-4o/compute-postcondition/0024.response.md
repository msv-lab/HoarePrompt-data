Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The program correctly handles scenarios where `a` is an empty string or where `b` is an empty string. The comparison between `a` and `b` is accurate in all cases, including edge cases, ensuring the correct output symbol is displayed.***
