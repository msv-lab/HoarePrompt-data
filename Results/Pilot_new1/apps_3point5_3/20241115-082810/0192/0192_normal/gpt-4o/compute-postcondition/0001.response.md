Example Answer:
The code calculates the result of ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). Since x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result is a non-negative integer**
