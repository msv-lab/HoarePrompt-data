Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers x and y from the user input, then calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2 and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it relies on user input. The function operates under the assumption that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It does not return any value.**
