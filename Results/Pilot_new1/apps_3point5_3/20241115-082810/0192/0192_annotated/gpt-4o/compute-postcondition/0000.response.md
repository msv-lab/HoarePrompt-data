Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. Since the input is not provided here, the specific values of `x` and `y` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
Output State: **Precondition: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
