Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers x and y from the input, calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from x, and prints the result. The formula used in the code, ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2), correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. 

The code handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000) and produces the expected output for the provided examples. Additionally, the annotations provide examples that align with the problem description, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
