Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The problem requires Memory to modify the length of a single side of the current triangle in a way that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area) and the length of each side should be an integer.

The code does not consider the constraints of modifying the sides of the triangle to maintain a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not provide the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting equilateral triangle of side length x.
