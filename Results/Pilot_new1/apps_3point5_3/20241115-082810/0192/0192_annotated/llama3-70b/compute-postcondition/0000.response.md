Example Answer:
x and y are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. The values of x and y are dependent on the input provided, satisfying the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
