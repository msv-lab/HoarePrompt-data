Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 10 and 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in words, combining the string representation of the tens place with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place. The postcondition accounts for all possible cases, ensuring the correct string representation is returned for any valid input `n` within the specified range.***
