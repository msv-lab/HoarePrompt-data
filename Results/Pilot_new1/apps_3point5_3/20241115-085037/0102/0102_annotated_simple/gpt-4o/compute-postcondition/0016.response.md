Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the list `teens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the list `tens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in words by combining the string representation of the tens place with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place from the lists `tens` and `ones` respectively. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for valid input `n` within the specified range, ensuring the correct string representation is returned.***
