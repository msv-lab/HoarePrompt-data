Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer where 0 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If s is less than 10, the code prints the string representation of the number in the `ones` list corresponding to the value of `s`. If s is between 10 and 19, the code prints the string representation of the number in the `teens` list corresponding to the value of `s - 10`. If s is 20 or greater, the code prints the string representation of the number in the `tens` list corresponding to the tens place of `s`, followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the number in the `ones` list corresponding to the ones place of `s` if the ones place is not zero. The postcondition covers all possible cases for the input integer `s` and the respective output based on the conditions met in the if-else block.***
