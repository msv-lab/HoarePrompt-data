The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer. The function has multiple return cases:
- If 0 <= n <= 9, the function returns the string representation of the number n from the `ones` list.
- If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the string representation of the number n in the `teens` list.
- If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the name of the tens place of n from the `tens` list.
- If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function concatenates the name of the tens place from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the name of the ones place from the `ones` list to represent the number n in words.

The postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including when n is a multiple of 10, n is between 10 and 19, and n is between 20 and 99.
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n and returns the string representation of the number n based on the provided constraints and relationships between the input parameters.**
