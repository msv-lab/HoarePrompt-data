The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n`, the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and `n`, and prints the maximum of these distances and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function assumes `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive.
