Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations suggest that the code calculates the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements in the array by finding their positions and calculating the distances from the edges of the array. However, the code does not consider the requirement of performing exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.

For example, in the case of input:
5
4 5 1 3 2

The correct output should be 3. However, the code does not swap any elements to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. In this case, swapping elements 1 and 2 would result in the maximum distance.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
