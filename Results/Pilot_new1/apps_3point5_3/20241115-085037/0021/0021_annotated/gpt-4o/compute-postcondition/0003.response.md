Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact value of `max_pos` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
