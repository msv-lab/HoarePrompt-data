Example Answer:
The variable `max_pos` is assigned the index of the integer `n` in list `a`. Since `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `max_pos` will be the index of the largest integer in the list `a`, which is n. Therefore, `max_pos` will be equal to n-1. The variable `min_pos` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1**
