Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input string of integers to a list of integers. The input contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, after execution, the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n**
