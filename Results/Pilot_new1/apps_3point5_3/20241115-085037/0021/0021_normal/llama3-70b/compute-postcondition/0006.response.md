Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`, and then prints it. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance value, `min_dist` is the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and the index of the last element in `a` minus 1, and n minus 2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance value, `min_dist` is the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and the index of the last element in `a` minus 1, and n minus 2**
