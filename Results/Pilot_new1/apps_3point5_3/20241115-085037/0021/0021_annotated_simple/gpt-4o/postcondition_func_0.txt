The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of each integer in the list from the ends (0 and `n-1`) and prints the maximum distance. The function assumes `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any specific output.
