Example Answer:
The `max_distance` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, where n is the number of elements in the list `a`. Since `max_pos` is n-1, the value of `max_distance` is n-1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is n-1, and `max_distance` is n-1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is n-1, and `max_distance` is n-1**
