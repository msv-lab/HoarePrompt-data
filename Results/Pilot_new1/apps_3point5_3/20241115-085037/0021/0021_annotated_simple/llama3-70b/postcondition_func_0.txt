The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, and the minimum distance between these positions. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1 -` minimum distance. The function assumes `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function does not explicitly return any value.
