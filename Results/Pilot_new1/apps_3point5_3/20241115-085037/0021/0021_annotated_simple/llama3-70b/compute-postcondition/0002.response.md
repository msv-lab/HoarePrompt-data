Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n, the index of 1 in the list will be the position of 1 in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a**
