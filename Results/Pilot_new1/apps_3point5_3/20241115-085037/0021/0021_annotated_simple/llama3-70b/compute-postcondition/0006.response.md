Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum between max_dist and n - 1 - min_dist and prints the result. The output state remains the same as the variables max_dist, min_dist, and n are not modified by the code snippet.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers, pos1 is the index of 1 in list a, posn is the index of n in list a, max_dist is the calculated maximum distance, min_dist is the minimum distance calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in list a**
