Output State: **`gcd` is recalculated based on the updated list `A`, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `max_divisor` is assigned the new value of `gcd` and the `gcd` is divisible by `i`. The square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`.**
