According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the current `i` is the last value before the loop ends, then `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. If `gcd` modulo `i` equals 0, then `max_divisor` should be updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`.
3. If `i` multiplied by `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` should be further updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd` divided by `i`.

State: **`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor`, `i` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions**.
