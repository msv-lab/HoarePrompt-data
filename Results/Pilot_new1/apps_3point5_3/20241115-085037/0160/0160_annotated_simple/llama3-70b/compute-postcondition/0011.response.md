Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, `N` is an integer, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input(). If `N` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains the value of the first element of list `A; max_divisor is assigned the value of `gcd`**
