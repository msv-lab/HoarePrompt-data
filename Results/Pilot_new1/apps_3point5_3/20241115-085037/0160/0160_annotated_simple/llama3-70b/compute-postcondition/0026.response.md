Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. The previous values of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions.
Output State: **`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions**
