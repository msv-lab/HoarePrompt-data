Example Answer:
The `gcd` variable is updated by taking the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` value and the next element in the list `A`. The initial value of `gcd` is the first element of list `A`. Therefore, after running the code, the `gcd` value is updated based on the calculation. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1.
Output State: **N is an integer, K is an integer, A_i are integers, A is a list of integers obtained from input(), gcd is updated based on the calculation, i is incremented by 1**
