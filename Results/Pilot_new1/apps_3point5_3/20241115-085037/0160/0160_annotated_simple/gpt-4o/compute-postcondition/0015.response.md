Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i` and `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The set `divisors` is updated with the divisors of `x` based on the condition `x % i == 0`. If `x % i != 0`, the loop will not execute and `divisors` will remain an empty set.**
