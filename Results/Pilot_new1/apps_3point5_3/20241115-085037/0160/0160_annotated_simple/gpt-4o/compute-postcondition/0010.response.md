According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `i` should be such that `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1**
