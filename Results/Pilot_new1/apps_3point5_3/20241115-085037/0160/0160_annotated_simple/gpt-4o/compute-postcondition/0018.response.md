Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x` and calculates all the divisors of `x`, including `i` and `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The function then returns the sorted list of these divisors in descending order. If `x` is not a positive integer, the function may not behave as expected. **
