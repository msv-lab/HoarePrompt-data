Example Answer:
The code adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`, which contains all the divisors of `x`. The set `divisors` now includes `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added value `x // i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`**
