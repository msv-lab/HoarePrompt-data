Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in a list, which is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. `func_2` correctly calculates all the divisors of a given integer x, which is also crucial for determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The annotations provided for both functions align with the actual code implementation and do not highlight any potential cases where the code might fail to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
