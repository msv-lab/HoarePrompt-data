According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing all the divisors of `x` up to `x`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the square root of `x` should be greater than the current `i`. This means `i` should be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x up to x, x is greater than or equal to 1, i is less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(x))**
