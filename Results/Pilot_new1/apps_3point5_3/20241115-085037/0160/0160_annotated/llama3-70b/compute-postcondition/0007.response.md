According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input split, gcd is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between the previous gcd value and A[i], and i is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so the adjusted state would be:
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input split, gcd is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between the previous gcd value and A[i], i is 3**
