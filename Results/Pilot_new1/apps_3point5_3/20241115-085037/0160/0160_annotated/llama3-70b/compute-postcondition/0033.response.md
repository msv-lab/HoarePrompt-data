Functionality: **The function reads two integers N and K from input, then reads a list of N integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A. After that, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd by iterating up to the square root of the gcd, updating the max_divisor accordingly. Finally, it prints the max_divisor.**
