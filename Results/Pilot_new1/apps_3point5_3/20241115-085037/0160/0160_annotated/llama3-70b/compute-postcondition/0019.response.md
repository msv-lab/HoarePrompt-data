According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `gcd` is calculated from elements in list `A`, `i` is `N`, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `N - 1` and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is at least 2, gcd is calculated from elements in list A, i is N - 1, max_divisor is assigned the value of gcd**
