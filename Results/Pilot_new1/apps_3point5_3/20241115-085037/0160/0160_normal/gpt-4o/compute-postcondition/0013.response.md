Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, `int(math.sqrt(x))`, `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `x // i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `divisors` is updated to include `i` and `x // i`, and `i+1` is the next positive integer in the range of `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. This covers all possible divisors of `x`, ensuring that the set `divisors` is comprehensive after the execution of the if statement.***
