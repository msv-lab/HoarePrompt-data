According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1, and `max_divisor` may have been updated based on the conditions mentioned. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `i` needs to be updated to the current value of `i` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1, `max_divisor` may have been updated**
