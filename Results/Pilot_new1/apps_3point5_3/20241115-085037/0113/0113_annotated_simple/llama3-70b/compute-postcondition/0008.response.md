Output State: **If n is already divisible by x, the loop will not execute and n, k, and x will remain unchanged. If n is not initially divisible by x, the loop will execute until n becomes divisible by x. After the loop finishes, n will be a positive integer divisible by x, k will remain the same, and x will be the result of 10 raised to the power of k.**
