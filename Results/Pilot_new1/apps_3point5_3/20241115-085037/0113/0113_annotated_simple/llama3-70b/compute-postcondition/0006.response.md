Example Answer:
`n` is incremented by 1, and since it is a positive integer that is not divisible by `x`, the new value of `n` will still be a positive integer not divisible by `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that is not divisible by `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is not divisible by `x`**
