Output State: **If n is initially divisible by x, n, k, and x remain unchanged. If n is not initially divisible by x, the loop will execute until n becomes divisible by x. After the loop finishes, n will be a positive integer divisible by x, k will remain the same, and x will be the result of 10 raised to the power of k.**
