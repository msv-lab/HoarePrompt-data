Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8. The value of `k` can range from 0 to 8, so the value of `multiplier` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
