Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
