According to the code, the loop will execute n times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains two tuples, `_` is 1, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input. To execute the loop one more time, `_` should be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains two tuples, `_` is 2, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
