Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained from splitting the input, and `_` is 2. Therefore, after execution, the list `buses` will contain the new tuple. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the new tuple, `_` is 2**
