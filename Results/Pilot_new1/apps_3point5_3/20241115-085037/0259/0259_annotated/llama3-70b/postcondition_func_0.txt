The function `func` reads input values for the number of buses `n`, the time `t`, and the schedules of the buses. It calculates the minimum waiting time for a bus based on the given schedules and the input time `t`. The function then prints the index of the bus with the minimum waiting time. If `n` is 0, the function does not iterate through the buses, keeping `min_time` as positive infinity and `ans` as -1. Potential edge cases to consider are negative `n` values and empty bus schedules.
