Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the problem description, the provided Python program accurately implements the logic described. The program correctly reads the input values, calculates the minimum waiting time for each bus route, and determines the bus route that Serval will use based on the given time. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the program works, detailing the state of the program after each step. The potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations are also considered within the program logic. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the expected output of the program. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
