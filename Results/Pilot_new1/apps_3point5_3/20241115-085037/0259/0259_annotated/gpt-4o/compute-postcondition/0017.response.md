According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, which is `i + 1`, and `n` is at least 0. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` need to be updated based on the calculated `wait_time`. The new values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` should be adjusted based on the logic that if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`.

State: **`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same.**
