Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is assigned a value from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a previously calculated value. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
