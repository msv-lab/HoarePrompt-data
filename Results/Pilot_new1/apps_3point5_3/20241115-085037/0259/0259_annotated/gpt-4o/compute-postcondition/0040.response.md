The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes. 
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. 
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of a route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time (index + 1) or -1 if no routes were chosen. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus routes with their respective arrival times and intervals. It then determines the index of the route with the minimum wait time or returns -1 if no routes were chosen. 
Functionality: **The function accepts the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus routes with their arrival times and intervals. It returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time (index + 1) or -1 if no routes were chosen.**
