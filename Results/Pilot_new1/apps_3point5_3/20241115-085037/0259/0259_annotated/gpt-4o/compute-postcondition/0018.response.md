Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are now updated based on the tuple values. The variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, `n` remains the same, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
