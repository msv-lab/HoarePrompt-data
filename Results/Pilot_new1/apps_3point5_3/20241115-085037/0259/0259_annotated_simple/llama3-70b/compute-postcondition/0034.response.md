The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the number of bus routes that can be completed within the time limit `t`. The function considers the bus routes with starting points `s_i` and destinations `d_i` for each route `i` (1 <= i <= n). The function calculates the total time required to complete each route and checks if it is less than or equal to the time limit `t`. The function then returns the count of bus routes that can be completed within the time limit `t`.
Functionality: **The function calculates the number of bus routes that can be completed within the time limit `t` based on the starting points, destinations, and time required for each route.**
