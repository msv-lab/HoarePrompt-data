Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The previous values of `buses` contain tuples, and now a new tuple `(s, d)` is added to it. The value of `_` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 2**
