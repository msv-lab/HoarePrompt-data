Example Answer:
The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity. Since this is the initial state, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes. t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. bus_routes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity.**
