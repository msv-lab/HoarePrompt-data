Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. The function calculates the minimum wait time for Serval at the station based on the bus routes and returns the index of the chosen route that minimizes the wait time. If `n` or `t` is 0, the function does not execute the loop.**
