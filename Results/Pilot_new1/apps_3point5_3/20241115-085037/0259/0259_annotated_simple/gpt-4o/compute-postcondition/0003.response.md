Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple at index `i` in the list `bus_routes`. Since `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the first tuple in the list. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in `bus_routes`**
