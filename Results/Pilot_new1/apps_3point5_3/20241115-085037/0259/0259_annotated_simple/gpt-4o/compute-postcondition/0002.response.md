According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to 0.
State: **Precondition: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0**
