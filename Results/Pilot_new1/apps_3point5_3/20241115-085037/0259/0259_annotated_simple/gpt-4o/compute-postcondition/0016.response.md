Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions mentioned in the precondition, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route (i + 1) that has the minimum wait time, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in `bus_routes`. The program fragment updates `min_wait_time` to the newly calculated `wait_time` if it is less than the current `min_wait_time`, and updates `chosen_route` to the current route index (i + 1). This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment execution.***
