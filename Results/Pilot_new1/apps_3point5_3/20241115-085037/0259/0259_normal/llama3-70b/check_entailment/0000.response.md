Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input data correctly and stores the bus routes in a list.
- It calculates the minimum time for each bus to reach the destination based on the current time `t`.
- It then prints the index of the bus that will arrive first.
- The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
- The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the code is correctly implemented.
