Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split by space. The values of `s` and `d` are integers from the input. The previous values of the variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than the current value, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple `(s, d)`, `s` and `d` are integers from input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple `(s, d)`, `s` and `d` are integers from input**
