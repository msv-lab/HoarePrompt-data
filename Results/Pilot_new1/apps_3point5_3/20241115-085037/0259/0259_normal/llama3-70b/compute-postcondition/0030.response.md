Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 3 elements. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new time and `ans` is updated to the index of the bus plus 1. The relationships between `min_time`, `ans`, and `buses` are maintained after the execution of the if statement, considering all possible edge cases.***
