According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the list `buses` is empty. To ensure the loop executes, `n` should be a positive integer, `t` should be a positive integer, and `buses` should be empty at the start. Additionally, since the loop variable `_` is used and not utilized within the loop body, no other adjustments are needed.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list**
