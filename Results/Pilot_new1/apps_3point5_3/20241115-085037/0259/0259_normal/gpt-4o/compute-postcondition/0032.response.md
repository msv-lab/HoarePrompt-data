Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated based on calculations, `n` is greater than the current value, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. This covers all scenarios where the wait time is either 0 or calculated based on the given conditions.***
