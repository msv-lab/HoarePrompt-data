Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all routes. `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route with the minimum wait time. `n` is greater than 0. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i) / d_i`. After the execution of the if statement, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum `wait_time` value, and `chosen_route` is updated to the corresponding route number.***
