Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the given string $s$ and then checks if the balance is equal to the desired balance $x$. If they are equal, it prints $n+1$ which represents the number of prefixes. If the difference between $x$ and the balance is a multiple of the difference between the counts of 0 and 1 in $s$, it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to reach the desired balance and prints it. The logic seems to be correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
