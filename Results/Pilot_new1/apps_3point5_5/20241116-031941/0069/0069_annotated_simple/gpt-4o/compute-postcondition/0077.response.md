Example Answer:
The `results` list appends the value of `count` at the end of each iteration. The value of `count` is the number of times the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied. If `prefix_balances` is empty or the balance is 0, `count` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: The `results` list appends the final value of `count` after all iterations.
Output State: **The `results` list appends the final value of `count` after all iterations**
