Output State: **`prefix_balances` list has at least `n + 1` elements, `n` is an integer value, `balance` is not equal to 0, each element `prefix_balances[i]` is updated as specified, `x` is an integer, `results` has an additional element appended which is the count of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the condition, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `count` is assigned the value 0 if `n` is less than 1, or the count of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.**
