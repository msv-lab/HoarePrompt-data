Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances based on the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, T is greater than 0, n, x, and results remain unchanged. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. The `balance` is updated based on the conditions in the if else block. If `balance` is 0, the `results` list appends -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise 0 is appended. If `balance` is not 0, the loop calculates the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition, updates `count` accordingly, and appends the final value of `count` to the `results` list.***
