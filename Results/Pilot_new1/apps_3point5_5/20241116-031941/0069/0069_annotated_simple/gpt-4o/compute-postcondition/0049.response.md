According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)` ensures that the loop will execute. So, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` and `results` remain unchanged, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')**
