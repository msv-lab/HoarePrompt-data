Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances based on the count of '0' and '1' in string `s`, T is greater than 0, n is greater than 0, x and results remain unchanged, balance is updated, `i` is 0, `prefix_balances` has at least three elements, `count` is 4. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, then `count` is increased by 1.***
