Output State: **The loop did not execute, so `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. `T` is greater than 0, `x` and `results` remain unchanged. `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `balance` is 0. The program did not enter the if block, so `x` is not in `prefix_balances`. `results` now contains an additional 0.**
