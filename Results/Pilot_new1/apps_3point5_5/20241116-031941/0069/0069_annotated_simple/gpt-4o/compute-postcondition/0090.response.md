According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` list has at least `n + 2` elements, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 5]`, `index` is increased by 6, `n` is incremented by 1, `prefix_balances[i + 1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i] + (1 if s[i] == '0' else -1)`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) and `i` is equal to `n`.

So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`.
State: **`prefix_balances` list has at least `n + 2` elements, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 5]`, `index` is increased by 6, `n` is incremented by 1, `prefix_balances[n + 2]` is updated to `prefix_balances[n + 1] + (1 if s[n + 1] == '0' else -1), `prefix_balances[n + 1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[n] + (1 if s[n] == '0' else -1)`**
