Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`. The variables `prefix_balances`, `T`, `n`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances based on the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, T is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances based on the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, T is greater than 0, `n`, `x`, and `results` remain unchanged**
