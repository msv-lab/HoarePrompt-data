Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, calculates the count of '0' and '1' characters in `s`, and determines a balance. Depending on the balance compared to `x`, it prints different values. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If the difference between `x` and the balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1', it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function does not explicitly return any value. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the values of `n`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
