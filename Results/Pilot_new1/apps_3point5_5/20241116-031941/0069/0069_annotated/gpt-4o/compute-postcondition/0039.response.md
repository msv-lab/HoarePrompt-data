Output State: **If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. If `balance` is not equal to 0, the loop calculates the number of elements in `prefix_balances` where the difference between `x` and the element is divisible by `balance` and the quotient is non-negative. The final value of `count` is the total count of such elements.**
