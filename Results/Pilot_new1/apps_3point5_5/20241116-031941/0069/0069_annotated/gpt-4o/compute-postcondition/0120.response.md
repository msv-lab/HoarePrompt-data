According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `n` is less than 1, `balance` is 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that meet certain criteria, `results` has at least 1 element. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must still have at least 1 element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `n` is less than 1, `balance` is 0, `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that meet certain criteria, `results` has at least 1 element**
