Example Answer:
The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The values of `T` and `index` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which is converted to an integer; `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.
Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which is converted to an integer; `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
