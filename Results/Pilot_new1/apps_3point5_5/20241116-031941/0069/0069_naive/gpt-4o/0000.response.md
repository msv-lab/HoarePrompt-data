Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input for each test case and calculates the balance of the string. It then iterates through each prefix of the string and calculates the balance of each prefix. Based on the given conditions, it correctly identifies the number of prefixes with the desired balance or outputs -1 if there are an infinite number of such prefixes. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
