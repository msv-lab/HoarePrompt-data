Output State: **If T is greater than 0, the loop will execute T times. For each iteration, n and x are assigned values from the input, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in string s, and balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). If T is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and no values are updated.**
