Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting. Since the input is split into two parts, `n` and `x` will take those values. The values of `n` and `x` depend on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input**
