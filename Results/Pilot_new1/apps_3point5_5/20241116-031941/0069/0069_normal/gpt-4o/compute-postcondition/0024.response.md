Output State: **The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. When the balance is 0, the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's is 0 as well. `x` is not in `prefix_balances`. `results` now contains an additional 0 appended to it.**
