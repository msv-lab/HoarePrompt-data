Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length (n + 2) filled with zeros, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `T` is greater than 0, `s` is the new value from `data[index + 5], `index` is the new incremented value, `balance` is the new calculated value, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated with the new value where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**.
