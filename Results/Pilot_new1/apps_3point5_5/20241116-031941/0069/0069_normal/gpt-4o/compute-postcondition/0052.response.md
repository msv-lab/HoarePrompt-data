Example Answer:
The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: The list `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same.
Output State: **The list `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same**
