Output State: **The loop updates the list `prefix_balances` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index. `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, and `n` remains the same. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1.**
