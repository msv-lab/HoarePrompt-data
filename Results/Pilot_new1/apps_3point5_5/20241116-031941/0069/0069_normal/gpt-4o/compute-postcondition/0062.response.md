Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, and `n` remains the same. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. Additionally, `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to `results`.***
