Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1. The list `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, and `b` remains the first element in the list.***
