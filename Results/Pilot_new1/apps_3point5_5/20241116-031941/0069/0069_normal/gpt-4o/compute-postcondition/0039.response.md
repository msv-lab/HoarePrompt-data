Output State: **`count` is an integer. For each element `b` in the list `prefix_balances`, if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. The list `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, and `b` remains the first element in the list after each iteration. If `prefix_balances` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
