Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 0 and T is greater than 0, the loop updates the prefix_balances list from index 1 to n based on the loop code condition. If n is 0 or T is 0, the loop does not execute, and the prefix_balances list remains filled with zeros. Additionally, when balance equals 0, the prefix_balances list is updated according to the loop code condition. After the if-else block executes, if x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to the results list; otherwise, 0 is appended. This ensures that the results list contains either -1 or 0 based on the presence of x in prefix_balances, while the prefix_balances list is updated as per the loop conditions and edge cases are handled appropriately.***
