Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of non-zero elements with a length greater than or equal to 1, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` incremented by 1, the balance is not equal to 0. After the execution of the if statement, the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` holds true, and the condition `(x - b) // balance >= 0` also holds true. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0, ensuring the correctness of the program's logic.***
