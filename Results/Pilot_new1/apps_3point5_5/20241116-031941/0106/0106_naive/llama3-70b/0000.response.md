Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the provided problem description. It considers the number of blocks, floors, and the time it takes to move between them accurately. The calculations for the minimum block time and minimum floor time are correct and the final output is the sum of these two times. The program handles the scenario where Edward needs to move between blocks and floors correctly, ensuring the minimum time is calculated accurately. Additionally, the program uses the correct formulae to calculate the block and floor numbers for Edward and Natasha's apartments. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
