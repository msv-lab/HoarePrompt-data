Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle edge cases where the values of `n, m, k, a, b` do not meet the specified constraints. Additionally, the code does not consider scenarios where apartment `a` and apartment `b` are the same. This means that the program may not always provide the correct output as per the problem description.
