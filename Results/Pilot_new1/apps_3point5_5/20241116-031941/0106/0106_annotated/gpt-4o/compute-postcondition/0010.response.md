Example Answer:
The variable `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `floor_b` is used in the calculation. The value of `floor_b` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time**
