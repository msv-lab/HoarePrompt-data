Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, so the value of `block` will also be a positive integer. The output state is: **`block` is a positive integer**.
Output State: **`block` is a positive integer**
