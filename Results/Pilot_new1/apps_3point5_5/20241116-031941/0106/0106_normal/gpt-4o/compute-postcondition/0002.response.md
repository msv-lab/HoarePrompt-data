Example Answer:
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`, where `floor_within_block` and `k` are known values. The value of `floor_within_block` divided by `k` is calculated first, then 1 is added to the result. Therefore, the output state is: `floor` is the result of `floor_within_block // k + 1`.
Output State: **`floor` is the result of `floor_within_block // k + 1**
