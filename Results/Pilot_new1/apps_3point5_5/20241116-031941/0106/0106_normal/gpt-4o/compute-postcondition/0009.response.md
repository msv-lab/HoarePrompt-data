Example Answer: 
`min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The value of `reverse_walk_time` is dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b` according to a specific formula. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b`, and the calculated `reverse_walk_time`.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated using a specific formula.**
