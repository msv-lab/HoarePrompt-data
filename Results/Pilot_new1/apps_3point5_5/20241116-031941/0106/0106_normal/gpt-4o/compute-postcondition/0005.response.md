Functionality: ** The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment` and calculates the block and floor numbers based on the given formula. It then returns the values of 'block' and 'floor'. The function assumes the parameters `m, n, k` are integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. However, there is a missing logic in the code related to handling cases where the parameters `m, n, k` are not within the specified range. **
