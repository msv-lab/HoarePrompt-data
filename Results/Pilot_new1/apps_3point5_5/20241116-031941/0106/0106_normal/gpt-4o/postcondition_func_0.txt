The function func_1 accepts five positive integer parameters n, m, k, a, and b. It calculates the total time required to travel from location a to location b within a building. The time includes the time to exit the building, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function then returns this total time. If floor_a is 1, the time to exit is 0; otherwise, it is calculated based on the floor_a value. The walking time between blocks is calculated in both direct and reverse directions, and the minimum of these two times is considered. The time to reach the target floor is based on the difference between floor_a and floor_b multiplied by 5. The total time is the sum of all these components.
