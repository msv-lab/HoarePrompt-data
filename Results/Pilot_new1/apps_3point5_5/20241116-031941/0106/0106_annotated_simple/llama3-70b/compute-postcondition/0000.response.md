Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting**
