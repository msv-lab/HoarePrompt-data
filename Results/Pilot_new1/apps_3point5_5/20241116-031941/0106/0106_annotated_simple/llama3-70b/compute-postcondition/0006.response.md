Example Answer:
`min_block_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. The values of `a_block` and `b_block` are already calculated based on the given formulas. The difference between `a_block` and `b_block` is taken, and the minimum value between this difference and the complement of this difference from `n` is multiplied by 15 to get the `min_block_time`. No other variables are affected in this process.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, and `b_floor` is calculated as described; `b_block` is calculated as ((b - 1) // (m * k)) + 1; `min_block_time` is an integer calculated value.**
