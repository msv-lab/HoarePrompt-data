Example Answer:
The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. The values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the output state is: `block` is the block number calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`block` is the block number calculated based on the given formula**
