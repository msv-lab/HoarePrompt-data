Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a` with at least one element, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. This condition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases where the program variables retain their initial conditions.***
