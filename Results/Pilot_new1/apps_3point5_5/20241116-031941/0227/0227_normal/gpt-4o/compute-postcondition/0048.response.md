According to the code, the loop can execute if `assigned` is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted so that `assigned` is not empty. Additionally, since `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a` with at least one element and the newly added element `a[i]`, `a` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. Lastly, `can_form` being False does not affect the loop execution.

State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n-1`, `can_form` is False**
