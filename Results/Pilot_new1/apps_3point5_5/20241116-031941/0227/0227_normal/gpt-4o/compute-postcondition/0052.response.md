Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n-1`, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in the `assigned` list. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
