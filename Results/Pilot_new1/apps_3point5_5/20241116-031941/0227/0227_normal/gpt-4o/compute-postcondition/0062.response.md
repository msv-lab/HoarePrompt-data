Output State: 
- If the difference between `a[i]` and any element `x` in `assigned` is found, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.
- If no such difference is found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False after the loop execution.
- `a` remains a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements.
- `assigned` may or may not contain the current element `x` being iterated over.
- `m` remains 3.
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `i` remains less than `n-1`.

**Note:** If `assigned` is empty or does not contain any element `x`, the loop will not execute, and `can_form` will remain False.
