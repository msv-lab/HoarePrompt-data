Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, a list of `n` distinct positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function processes all elements in the list `a`, checking if each element can be formed as a sum of two elements from the `assigned` set. If an element cannot be formed, `m` is incremented by 1. The function returns the final value of 'm' after processing all elements in list 'a'. If the `assigned` set has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute.**
