Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the element at index 1 in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index 0, and `m` is an integer. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to twice the value of the element at index `i-1`, then `m` is increased by 1.***
