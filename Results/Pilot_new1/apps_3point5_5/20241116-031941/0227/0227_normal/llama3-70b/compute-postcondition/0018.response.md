Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a list of integers `a`, sorts the list, and iterates through the list checking if each element is twice the value of the previous element. If not, it increments the count `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and provides a specific output based on the constraints provided.**
