Example Answer:
The code snippet takes input in the form of a space-separated sequence of integers, converts them into a list of integers, and assigns it to variable `a`. The length of the sequence is represented by the positive integer `n`. Therefore, after execution, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the sequence, `a` is a list of integers**
