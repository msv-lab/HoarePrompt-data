Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating if a[i] - x is found in the `assigned` list. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1 and `x` remains unchanged. If `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by the number of times the condition is met and `x` is updated to the next element in the `assigned` list. If the `assigned` list is empty, `can_form` remains False, `m` is increased by 1, and `x` is not updated.***
