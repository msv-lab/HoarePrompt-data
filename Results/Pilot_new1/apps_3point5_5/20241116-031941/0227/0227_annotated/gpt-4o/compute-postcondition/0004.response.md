According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. Since the loop starts from 1, the value of `i` will start from 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 1, `a` must be a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest element of list `a`, and `m` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
