According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the condition for the loop to terminate is if the element at index `i` in list `a` minus `x` is found in the `assigned` list. If this condition is not met, the loop can execute one more time. Additionally, if `assigned` is not empty, the loop will execute at least once. After the if-else block, `m` is increased by 1 and `can_form` remains False.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **If the element at index `i` in list `a` minus `x` is not found in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, and `assigned` is not empty.**
