According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the assigned list. If the assigned list has more elements to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the assigned list contains at least one element, and `x` is the first element in the assigned list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the assigned list must have more elements, and `x` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable, `m` is increased by 1, and the next element in the assigned list is set as `x`**
