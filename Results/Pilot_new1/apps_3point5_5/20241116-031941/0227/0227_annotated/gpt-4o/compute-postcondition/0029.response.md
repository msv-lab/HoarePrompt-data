Example Answer:
`can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `can_form` changes from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` is a list with at least one element, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is equal to `x` plus an element in the list `assigned`.
Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` is a list with at least one element, and the element at index `i` of list `a` is equal to `x` plus an element in the list `assigned`**
