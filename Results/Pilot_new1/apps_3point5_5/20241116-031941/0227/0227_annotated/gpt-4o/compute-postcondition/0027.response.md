According to the code, the loop can execute if the assigned list is not empty. Therefore, the assigned list needs to be adjusted to have at least one element. Additionally, the initial state before the loop starts states that can_form is False and m is increased by 1. Since these values are not directly related to the loop execution condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run. 
State: **can_form is False, m is increased by 1, assigned is a list with at least one element**
