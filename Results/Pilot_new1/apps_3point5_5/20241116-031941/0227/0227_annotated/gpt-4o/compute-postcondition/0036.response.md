According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `assigned`. If `assigned` contains at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is a boolean variable, `m` is increased by 1, and `assigned` contains at least one element. To execute the loop one more time, `assigned` should contain at least two elements.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least two elements**
