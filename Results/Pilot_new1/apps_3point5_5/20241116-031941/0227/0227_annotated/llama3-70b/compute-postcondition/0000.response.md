Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9); n is an input integer.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23). a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9); n is an input integer.**
