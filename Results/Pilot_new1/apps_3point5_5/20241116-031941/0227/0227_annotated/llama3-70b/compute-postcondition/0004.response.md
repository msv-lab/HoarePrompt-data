According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. The initial state `m` is 1, so it doesn't affect the loop execution. Before the loop starts, the list `a` being sorted in ascending order does not have any direct impact on the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1.
State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
