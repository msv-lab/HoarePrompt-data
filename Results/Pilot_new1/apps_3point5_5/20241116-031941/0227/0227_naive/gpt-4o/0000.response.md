Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the sorted input sequence and checks if the current element can be formed by the sum of two previously assigned variables. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The logic is sound and covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program also handles the case where it is not possible to perform the sequence of operations by returning -1.
