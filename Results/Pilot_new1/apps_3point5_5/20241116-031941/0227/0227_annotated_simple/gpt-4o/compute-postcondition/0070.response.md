The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers where each element is within the range 1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9. After the loop execution, the function returns the number of times 'can_form' was False. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the number of times 'can_form' was False after the loop execution.
