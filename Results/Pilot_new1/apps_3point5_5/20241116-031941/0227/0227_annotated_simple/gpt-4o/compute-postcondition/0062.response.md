Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` such that their difference is equal to `a[i]`. If such a pair is found, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop breaks. The loop will not execute if `assigned` is empty. In this case, `m` is not increased, `a[i]` is not added to `assigned`, and `i` remains the same.**
