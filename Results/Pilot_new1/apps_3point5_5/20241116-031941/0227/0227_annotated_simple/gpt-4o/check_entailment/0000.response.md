Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem. It iterates through the input sequence and checks if the current element can be formed by adding two elements that are already in the set of assigned variables. If not, it increments the count of variables needed. The logic of the program ensures that the minimum number of variables required is calculated accurately. The program handles the given problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output.
