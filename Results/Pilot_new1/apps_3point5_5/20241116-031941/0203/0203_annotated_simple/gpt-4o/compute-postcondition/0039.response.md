According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `d_queue` will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Otherwise, `r_queue` will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`. In both cases, `r_index` is the index of the 'R' character that was removed, and `d_index` is either greater than or equal to `r_index`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **d_queue and r_queue are both not empty, with the specified conditions on the indices**
