Example Answer:
`d_queue` will have the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended to it. The values of `r_queue`, `r_index`, and `d_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended, r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index.
Output State: **d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended, r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index**
