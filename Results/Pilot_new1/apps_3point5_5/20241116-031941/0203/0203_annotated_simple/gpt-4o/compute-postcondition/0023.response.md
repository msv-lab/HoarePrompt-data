Example Answer:
The value of `d_index` is incremented by `n` and then appended to `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `r_index`, and `d_index` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping) along with the new value of `d_index`.
Output State: **d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping) along with the new value of `d_index`**
