Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If v == 'D', d_queue is adjusted based on the next character in votes, i is incremented by 1, and r_queue remains unchanged. If v == 'R', r_queue contains 1 if the next character is 'R' and remains unchanged otherwise, d_queue is adjusted based on the next character in votes, r_queue contains [1, 2], and i is 2.***
