Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`, which means `r_queue` now contains the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, after execution, `r_queue` will contain 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue and r_queue are adjusted based on the next character in votes, i is 1 and r_queue contains 1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue and r_queue are adjusted based on the next character in votes, i is 1, r_queue contains 1**
