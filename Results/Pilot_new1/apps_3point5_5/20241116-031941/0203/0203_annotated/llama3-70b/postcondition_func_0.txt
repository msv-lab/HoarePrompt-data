The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `fractions` containing 'D's and 'R's. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If there are more 'D's than 'R's, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If the `fractions` list is empty, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, as the input is read within the function.
