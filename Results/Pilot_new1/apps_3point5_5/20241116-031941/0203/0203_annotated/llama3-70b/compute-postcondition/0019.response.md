Output State: 
If the fractions list is empty, the loop will not execute, and depublicans and remocrats will remain 0. 
If the fractions list contains elements, the loop will iterate through each element and increment either depublicans or remocrats based on the value of the fraction. 
After the loop executes, depublicans will represent the total number of 'D' fractions in the list, and remocrats will represent the total number of 'R' fractions in the list. 
*n is an integer representing the number of employees. If fraction is 'D', depublicans is incremented by 1; if fraction is 'R', remocrats is incremented by 1. In all cases, only one of depublicans or remocrats is increased by 1 based on the value of fraction.*
