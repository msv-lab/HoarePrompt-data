Postcondition: ***n is an integer representing the number of employees. If the fractions list is empty, depublicans and remocrats remain 0. If the fractions list contains elements, the loop iterates through each element and increments either depublicans or remocrats based on the value of the fraction. After the loop executes, depublicans represents the total number of 'D' fractions in the list, and remocrats represents the total number of 'R' fractions in the list. If depublicans is greater than remocrats, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
