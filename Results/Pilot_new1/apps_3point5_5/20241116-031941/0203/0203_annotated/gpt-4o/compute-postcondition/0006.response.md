Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. The last character in the `votes` string is 'D', and the `d_queue` is filled with the count of 'D' characters, so the `d_queue` will now have an additional index `i` appended to it.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character, d_queue is filled with the count of 'D' characters and the index i appended**
