Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to `r_queue`, which means `r_queue` now contains the count of 'R' characters along with the newly added index. The character at index `i` is 'R', so the count of 'R' characters in `r_queue` increases by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character, d_queue is filled with the count of 'D' characters, r_queue is filled with the count of 'R' characters along with the index i. The character at index i is not 'D'**
