The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it is expected to work with the predefined constraints: `n` is an integer greater than 0, and `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. The function is supposed to process and analyze the votes data in some way, but the specific details of the return value are not provided.
