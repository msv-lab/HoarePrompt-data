Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `d_queue`. The previous state of `d_queue` is not given, so after execution, `d_queue` will contain the value of `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue contains the appended value of `i`, and r_queue remains unchanged.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue contains the appended value of `i`, and r_queue remains unchanged**
