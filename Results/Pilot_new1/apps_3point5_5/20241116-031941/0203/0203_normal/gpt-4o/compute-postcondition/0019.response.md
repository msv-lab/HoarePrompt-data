Output State: If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. The loop iterates through the characters in `votes` and appends the index `i` to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the character at that index. If the character is 'D', the index is appended to `d_queue`, otherwise, it is appended to `r_queue`. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.
