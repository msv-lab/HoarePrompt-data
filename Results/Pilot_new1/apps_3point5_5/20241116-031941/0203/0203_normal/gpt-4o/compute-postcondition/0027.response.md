According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
- `d_index` must be less than the updated `r_index`.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is updated based on the popped value from `r_queue`, then after the execution of the if-else block, if `d_index` is less than the updated `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with the value of `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is appended with the value of `r_index + n`.**
