Postcondition: ***If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. After the execution of the if-else block, if `d_queue` is not empty, 'D' is printed. If `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed. The loop will continue executing as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty. Ensure that the logic handles all possible edge cases related to the indices and queues.***
