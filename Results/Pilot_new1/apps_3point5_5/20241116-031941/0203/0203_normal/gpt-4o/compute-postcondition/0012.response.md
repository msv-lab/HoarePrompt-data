Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. The previous state of `r_queue` is not provided, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`.**
