Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the list `d_queue`. The previous state of `d_queue` is unknown, so after execution, `d_queue` will have the updated values based on the next character in `votes`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`**
