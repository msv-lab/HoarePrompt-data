Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fractions of the employees, `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fractions of the employees, `d_queue` is an empty list**
