Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It maintains two queues, one for 'D' employees and one for 'R' employees. It then simulates the voting process by popping employees from the queues and adding them back with an offset if needed. The program correctly determines the outcome of the vote based on the final state of the queues. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description for every input.
