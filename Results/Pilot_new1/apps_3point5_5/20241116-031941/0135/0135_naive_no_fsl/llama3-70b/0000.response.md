Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input, then it iterates through all integers from 1 to k to calculate the remainder of n divided by i. It then checks if the remainder is already in a set, if it is, it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". This logic correctly follows the problem description and ensures that all remainders are distinct. The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
