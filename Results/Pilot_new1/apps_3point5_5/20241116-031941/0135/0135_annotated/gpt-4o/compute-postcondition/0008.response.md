Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer where n ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If the `remainder` is present in the `seen_remainders` set, then the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
