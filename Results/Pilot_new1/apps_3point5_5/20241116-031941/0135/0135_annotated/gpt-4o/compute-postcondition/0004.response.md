According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than or equal to n. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the values of `n` and `k` need to satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ k ≤ 10^18. Additionally, since `seen_remainders` is an empty set before the loop starts, it does not affect the loop execution. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that n ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
