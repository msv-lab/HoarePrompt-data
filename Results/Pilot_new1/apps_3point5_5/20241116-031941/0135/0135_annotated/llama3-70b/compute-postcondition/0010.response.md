Example Answer:
The variable `i` is assigned the value of the previous value of `k` + 1. The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. The variables `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to the previous value of `k` + 1, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to the previous value of `k` + 1, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`**
