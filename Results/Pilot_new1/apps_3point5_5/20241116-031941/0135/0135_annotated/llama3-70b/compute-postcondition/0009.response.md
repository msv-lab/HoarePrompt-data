According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous value of `k`. 
State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to the previous value of `k` + 1**
