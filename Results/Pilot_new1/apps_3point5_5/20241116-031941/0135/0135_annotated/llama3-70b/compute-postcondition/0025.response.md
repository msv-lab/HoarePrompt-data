Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, then iterates from 1 to `k`. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by the current iteration value. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it adds the remainder to a set. After the loop, if no repeated remainders were found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value.**
