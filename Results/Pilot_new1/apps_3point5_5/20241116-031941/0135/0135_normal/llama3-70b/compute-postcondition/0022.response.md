Output State: **If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute. If `n` is 0, the loop will execute but only once with `remainder` being 0. If `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, the loop will iterate through `k` values, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and checking if it's in `seen`. If a repeated remainder is found, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, `seen` will contain unique remainder values after the loop executes.**
