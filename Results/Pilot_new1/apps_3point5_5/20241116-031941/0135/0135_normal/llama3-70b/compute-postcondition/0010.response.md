Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers. Since `i` is 2, the value of `remainder` will be the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
