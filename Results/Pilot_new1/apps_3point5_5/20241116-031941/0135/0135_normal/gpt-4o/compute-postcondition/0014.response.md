Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is the number of iterations (up to k), `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i. If `remainder` is in the list of `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the values of n, k, i, and remainder.**
