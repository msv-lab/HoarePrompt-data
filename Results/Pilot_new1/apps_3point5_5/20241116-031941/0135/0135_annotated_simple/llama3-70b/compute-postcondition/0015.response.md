According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, if the `remainder` is not already present in `seen`, it is added to `seen`, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `remainder` remain unchanged**
