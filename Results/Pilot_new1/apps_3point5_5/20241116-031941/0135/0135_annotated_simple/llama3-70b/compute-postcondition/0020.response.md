Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as `n % i`. If `remainder` is in the set `seen`, then 'No' is printed, and the program exits. After that, `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. The values of `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `i` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i` are integers less than or equal to `k`, and `remainder` is updated based on the calculation `n % i`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i` are integers less than or equal to `k`, and `remainder` is updated based on the calculation `n % i`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits.**
