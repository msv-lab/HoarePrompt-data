Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. The initial state mentions that `n` and `k` are integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is included in `seen_remainders`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k+1, and `remainder` is the result of n % (k+1).
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k+1, and `remainder` is the result of n % (k+1)**
