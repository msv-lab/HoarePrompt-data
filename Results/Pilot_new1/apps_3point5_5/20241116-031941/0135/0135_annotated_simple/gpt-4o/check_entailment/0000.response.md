Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if all the remainders obtained from dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. The program uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is encountered. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the remainders are distinct or not.
