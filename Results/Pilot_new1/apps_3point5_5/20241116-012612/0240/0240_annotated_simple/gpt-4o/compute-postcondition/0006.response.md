The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. The previous value of `candidate` is a valid number string. Therefore, the Output State is: `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`**
