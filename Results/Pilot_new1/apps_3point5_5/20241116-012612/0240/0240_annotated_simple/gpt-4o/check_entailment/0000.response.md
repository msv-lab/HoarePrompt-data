Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program consists of three functions. 
1. The `func_1` function takes in the string `s` and the substring `sub` that Vasya remembers. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`, generates possible numbers from these remaining characters, and returns the smallest possible number.
2. The `is_valid_number` function checks if a given number string contains the remembered substring `sub` and has a length equal to `n_len`.
3. The `generate_possible_numbers` function generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters and checks if each permutation is a valid number using the `is_valid_number` function.

The program logic seems to correctly follow the problem description by finding the smallest possible initial integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate given the shuffled string and the remembered substring. The functions are appropriately structured to handle the input data and generate the correct output. No specific case has been provided that shows the program not working as expected, so the correctness is deemed as True.
