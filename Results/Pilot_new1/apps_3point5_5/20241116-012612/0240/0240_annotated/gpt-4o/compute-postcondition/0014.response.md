Output State: 
- If `chars` is a non-empty string and `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, the loop will generate permutations of `chars` and check if each permutation is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If a valid number is found, it will be yielded as `candidate`. 
- If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a substring of `chars`, the loop will not execute, and no action will be taken. 
- After the loop executes, `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, and `candidate` will be strings.
