According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars` and `perm`. If there are more permutations to generate, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings. To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state such that there are more permutations left to generate. Therefore, the state of the variables should be adjusted in a way that there are more permutations to explore.
State: **Adjust the state of `chars`, `perm` to have more permutations left to generate**
