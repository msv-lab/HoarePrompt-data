Example Answer:
The function yields the value of `candidate`, which is the first permutation of `chars`. The variables `chars`, `perm`, `sub`, and `candidate` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is not an empty string, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is not an empty string, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`**
