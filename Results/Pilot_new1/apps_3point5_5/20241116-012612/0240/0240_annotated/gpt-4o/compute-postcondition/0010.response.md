Example Answer:
The string `candidate` is created by joining the characters of the string `perm`. As `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be the next permutation of `chars` as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub`, `candidate` are strings, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
