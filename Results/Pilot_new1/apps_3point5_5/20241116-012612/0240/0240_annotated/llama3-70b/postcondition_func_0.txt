The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and t. It creates a set t_set containing unique characters from t. Then, it iterates through each character in s and appends it to n if it is present in t_set. After that, it appends the entire string t to n. Finally, the function returns the integer value of n. If s is empty or no characters from s are in t_set, n remains an empty string.
