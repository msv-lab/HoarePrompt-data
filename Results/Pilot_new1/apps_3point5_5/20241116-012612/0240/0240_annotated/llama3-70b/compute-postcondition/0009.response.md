According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are characters left in `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` still has characters left to iterate over. If the next character `c` in `s` is present in `t_set`, then `n` is increased by the value of `c`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be present in `t_set`.
State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate over, the next character `c` in `s` is present in `t_set`, `n` is increased by the value of `c`**
