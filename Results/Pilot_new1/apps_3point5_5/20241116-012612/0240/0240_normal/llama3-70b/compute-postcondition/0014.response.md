Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `t`. If `t` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain the same. If `t` is not empty, `n` will be concatenated with `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: If `t` is an empty string, `n` remains the same; if `t` is not empty, `n` is concatenated with `t`.
Output State: **If `t` is an empty string, `n` remains the same; if `t` is not empty, `n` is concatenated with `t`**
