According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is a string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be considered. If `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` will be updated by concatenating `c` to its previous value. If `c` is not in `t_set`, there will be no change to `n`. Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with more characters, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`.**
