According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. The set `t_set` containing the characters of string `t` is not directly used in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted. The string `t` is not directly used in the loop condition either. At the start of the loop, `n` is an empty string, which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `s` should not be an empty string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
