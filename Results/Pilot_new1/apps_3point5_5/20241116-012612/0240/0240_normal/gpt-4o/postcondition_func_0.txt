The function func_1 accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It decrements the counts of characters in `s_counter` based on the counts in `sub_counter` for each character in `sub_counter`. Then, it generates possible numbers from the remaining characters in `s_counter` and `sub`, finds the smallest number among them, and returns it as the output.
