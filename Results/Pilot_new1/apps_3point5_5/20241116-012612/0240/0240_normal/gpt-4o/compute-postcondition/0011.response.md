Example Answer:
The function `yield`s the `candidate` string. The variables `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is a string formed by joining `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is a string formed by joining `perm`**
