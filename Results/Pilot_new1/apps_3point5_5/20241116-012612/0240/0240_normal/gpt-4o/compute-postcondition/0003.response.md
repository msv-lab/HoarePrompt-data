Example Answer:
The function yields the value of `candidate`. Since no modifications are made to the variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`chars` has at least 1 character, `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number, `candidate` is the result of joining the elements of `perm`, and the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true**
