Output State: 
- `chars` contains at least 1 character and `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number.
- `candidate` is a string formed by joining the elements of `perm`.
- If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`.
- If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns false, there is no change in the state of the variables.
- If `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the variables.
