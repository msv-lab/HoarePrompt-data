Example Answer:
The `candidate` variable is updated by joining the elements of `perm`. The value of `perm` is not provided, so the exact value of `candidate` cannot be determined. The outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` will determine if the loop continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, and the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` determines the continuation of the loop.
Output State: **`chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, and the outcome of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` determines the continuation of the loop**
