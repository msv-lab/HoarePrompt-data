Correctness: **True**

In this case, the program seems to be handling the problem description correctly. The function `func_1` takes in the string `s` received by Kate and the substring `sub` that Vasya remembers. It then generates all possible numbers by permuting the remaining characters after removing the characters in the substring `sub`. It checks if the generated number is valid by ensuring that the substring `sub` is present in the number and the length of the number is equal to `n_len`.

The function then finds the smallest possible integer `n` by selecting the minimum number from the generated possible numbers. The program seems to be handling the problem description correctly by generating the smallest possible initial integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate.
