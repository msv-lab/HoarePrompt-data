Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly checks if a given string is an "s-palindrome" by comparing the characters at the beginning and end of the string. It returns True if the string is symmetric about the middle and False otherwise. The logic implemented in the function aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, the function will accurately determine if the string is an "s-palindrome".
