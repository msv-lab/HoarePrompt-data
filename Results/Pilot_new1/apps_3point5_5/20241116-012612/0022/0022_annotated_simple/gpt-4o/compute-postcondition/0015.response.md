Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. If the length of the string is at least 2, it iterates through the string checking if the characters at the beginning and end are the same. If any pair of characters is different, it returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, it returns True. The function effectively checks if the input string is a palindrome.**
