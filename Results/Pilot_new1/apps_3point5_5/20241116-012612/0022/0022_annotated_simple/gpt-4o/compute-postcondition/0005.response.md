According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to progress to the next iteration.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
