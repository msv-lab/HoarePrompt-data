Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This covers all cases where the string `s` does not satisfy the palindrome property at index `i`.***
