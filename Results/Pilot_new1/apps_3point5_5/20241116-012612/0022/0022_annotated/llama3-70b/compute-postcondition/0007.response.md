Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True if all characters at index `i` and index `n - i - 1` of string `s` are equal for all `i` from 0 to (n//2) - 1. If at any point the characters at index `i` and index `n - i - 1` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement breaks.***
