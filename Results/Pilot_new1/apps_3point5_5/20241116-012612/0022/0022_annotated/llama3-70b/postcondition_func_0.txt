The function `func` reads a string input `s` from the user, calculates its length `n`, and checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end positions. If the characters do not match at any point, the variable `is_spalindrome` is set to False. The function then prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, indicating that the string is a palindrome, and 'NIE' if it is False. The function does not explicitly return any value.
