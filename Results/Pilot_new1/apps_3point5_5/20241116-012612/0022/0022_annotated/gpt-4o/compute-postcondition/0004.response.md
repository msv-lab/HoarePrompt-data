Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `s` has at least two characters and the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal for any `i` within the valid range, then the function returns False. This covers all cases where the characters at symmetric positions are not equal.***
