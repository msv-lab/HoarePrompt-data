According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
