Example Answer:
The variable `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`, which can range from 1 to 1000 characters. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of string `s`**
