According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is 2 or greater, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is 2 or greater, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 2**
