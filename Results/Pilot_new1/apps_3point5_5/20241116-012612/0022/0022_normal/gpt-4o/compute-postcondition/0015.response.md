Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). It does so by comparing characters at symmetric positions in the string. If `s` is a palindrome, the function returns True. If `s` is not a palindrome or the length of `s` is less than 2, it returns False. The loop will not execute if the length of `s` is less than 2. **
