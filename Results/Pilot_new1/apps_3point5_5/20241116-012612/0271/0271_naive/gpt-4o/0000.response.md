Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It checks the remainder when dividing the input by 10, and based on that remainder, it either subtracts the remainder from the input or adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input. This logic covers all possible cases and correctly rounds the number as per the problem description. All the provided examples also work correctly with this logic.
