The function `func` reads an integer input from the user, and based on the value of the input:
- If the input is divisible by 10, it prints the input itself.
- If the input is not divisible by 10:
  - If the last digit of the input is less than or equal to 5, it prints the input without the last digit.
  - If the last digit of the input is greater than 5, it prints the next multiple of 10 greater than the input.
The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
