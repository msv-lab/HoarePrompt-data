Example Answer: 
The code calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5. The expression ensures that the result will be the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: *n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5, and the result of the expression is the next multiple of 10 greater than n.*
