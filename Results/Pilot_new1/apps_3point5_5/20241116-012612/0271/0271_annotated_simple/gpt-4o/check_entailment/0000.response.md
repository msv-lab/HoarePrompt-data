Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an input integer `n` and calculates the remainder when divided by 10. It then checks if the remainder is less than or equal to 5. If true, it rounds down `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0 by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If false, it rounds up `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0 by adding the difference of 10 and the remainder to `n`. This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the program correctly rounds `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0.
