Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it checks the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints `n` plus 10 minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. The function operates without any input parameters and provides output based on the conditions specified in the code.**
