Example Answer:
If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, the value of `result` is the difference between `n` and `remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, the value of `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`). The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, and the value of `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9. Based on these conditions, the value of `result` is calculated accordingly. After executing the code, the value of `result` will be printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, and the value of `result` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above.**
