Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` has a value of 0 if `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`. The values in `window_counts` for all other keys remain unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `n`, `counts`, `found`, `colors`) maintain their initial values as described in the precondition.***
