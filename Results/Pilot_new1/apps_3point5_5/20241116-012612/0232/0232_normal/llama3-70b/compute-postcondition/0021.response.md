Example Answer:
The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `n` and `found` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 1 or greater, `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is 1 or greater, `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
