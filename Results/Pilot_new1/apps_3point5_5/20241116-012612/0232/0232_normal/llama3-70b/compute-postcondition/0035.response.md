Postcondition: ***`n` is 1 or greater, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` set to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. After the execution of the if statement, if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged.***
