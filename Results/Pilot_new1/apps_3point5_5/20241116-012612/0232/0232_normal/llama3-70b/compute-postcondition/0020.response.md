According to the code, the loop will execute at least once if there is at least one color in the colors list. If the colors list is empty, the loop does not execute. Since `n` is used as the range limit, it should be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, the `found` variable is False. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is 1 or greater, `found` is False**
