Postcondition: ***If `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts up to index `j` where the count for the color at index `j` in the list `colors` is incremented by 1. If the color is not present in `window_counts`, the color count for that color is set to 1 in `window_counts`. `found` is True, `color` remains the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. The count for each color in `window_counts` matches the target count specified in the `counts` list. Upon satisfying the condition where all color counts in `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated.***
