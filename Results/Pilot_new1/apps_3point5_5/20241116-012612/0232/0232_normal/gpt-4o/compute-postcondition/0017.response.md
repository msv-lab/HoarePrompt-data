Example Answer:
The value of `colors[right]` is used as the key to increment the value in `current_counts` by 1. The index `right` is incremented by 1, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0**
