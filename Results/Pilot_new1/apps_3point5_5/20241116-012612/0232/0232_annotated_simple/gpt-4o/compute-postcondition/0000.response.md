Example Answer:
The code creates a dictionary `desired_counts` where the keys are integers from 1 to `m` and the values are taken from the list `k`. The range starts from 1 and goes up to `m + 1`. Since `m` is a positive integer, the range will be from 1 to `m`. The dictionary is created by zipping the keys and values together. 
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k**
