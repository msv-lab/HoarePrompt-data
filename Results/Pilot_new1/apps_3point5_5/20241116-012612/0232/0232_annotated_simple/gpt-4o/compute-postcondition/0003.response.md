According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, desired_counts should have keys from 1 to m, values taken from list k; current_counts should be a defaultdict with integer values set to 0, and left should be 0. Inside the loop, right iterates over the range from 0 to n-1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0, left is 0, right is from 0 to n-1**
