Example Answer:
The value of `colors[right]` is used as the key to increment the value in `current_counts` by 1. The previous state of `current_counts` is unknown, and the value of `colors[right]` is also not provided. Therefore, the output state is: desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0, left is 0, right is from 0 to n-1.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0, left is 0, right is from 0 to n-1**
