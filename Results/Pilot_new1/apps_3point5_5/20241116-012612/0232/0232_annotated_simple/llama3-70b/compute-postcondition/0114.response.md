According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The counts in the sorted window_counts align with the counts in the counts list, leading to found being set to True and the loop terminating. If all counts in the sorted window_counts match the corresponding counts in the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, found remains unchanged, and the loop continues. j is less than n**
