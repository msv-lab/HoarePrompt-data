Output State: **If `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1 more than its previous value, `found` is True if all counts match the desired counts, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` is updated to include `color` with a value of 1.**
