Example Answer:
The variable `found` is initialized as `False`. The loop does not execute as there are no colors in the list, so the `color_counts` dictionary remains empty. The final state includes `n` as the number of Jedi Knights, `m` as the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` as an empty list, `counts` as a list of desired counts of lightsabers, and `color_counts` as an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` is the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is an empty list, `counts` is a list of desired counts of lightsabers, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
