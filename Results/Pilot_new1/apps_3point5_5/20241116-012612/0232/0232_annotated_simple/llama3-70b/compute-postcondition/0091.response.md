Example Answer:
`window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0, where `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and `color` is not in `window_counts`. The previous values of `n`, `i`, `j`, `colors`, `found` are unknown, so the output state is: If `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 0, `found` is True if all counts match the desired counts, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and `color` is not in `window_counts`.
Output State: **If `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 0, `found` is True if all counts match the desired counts, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and `color` is not in `window_counts**
