Postcondition: ***If color is not in window_counts, it is added with a value of 1. If color is already present in window_counts, its value is incremented by 1. If all counts in the sorted window_counts match the corresponding counts in the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks. After the execution of the if statement, window_counts[color] will be either 0 if color was not present in window_counts, or it will be incremented by 1 if color was already in window_counts. The overall state ensures that the counts in the sorted window_counts align with the counts in the counts list, leading to found being set to True and the loop termination.***
