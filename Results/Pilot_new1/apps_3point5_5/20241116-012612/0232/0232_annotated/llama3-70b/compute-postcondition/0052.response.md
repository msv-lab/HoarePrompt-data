Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean that is True if all counts of colors in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets. `i` remains 0. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. `j` is an integer less than `n`. `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` keys, where each color has a value of 1 if it was not previously in `window_counts` and the counts match the target values for each color. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and if `color` was not in `window_counts`, its value is now 1. If the condition in the if part is satisfied, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than or equal to `i`), the values remain unchanged: `found` remains False, `i` remains 0, `n` is an integer less than or equal to 0, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.***
