Output State: **The loop iterates through the list of colors and updates the dictionary `color_counts` to keep track of the counts of each color. If a color is not already in `color_counts`, it is added with a count of 1. If the loop does not execute, it means `colors` is an empty list, and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
