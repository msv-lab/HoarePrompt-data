Example Answer:
The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
