Functionality: **The function reads input for the number of colors, colors list, and counts list. It then iterates through the colors list to update a dictionary with the counts of each color. After that, it searches for a window of colors that matches the counts specified in the counts list. If such a window is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function determines the minimum number of lightsabers that need to be repainted to achieve the desired counts of lightsabers for each color.**
