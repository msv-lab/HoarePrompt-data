Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their desired counts equal to their current counts in `current_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
