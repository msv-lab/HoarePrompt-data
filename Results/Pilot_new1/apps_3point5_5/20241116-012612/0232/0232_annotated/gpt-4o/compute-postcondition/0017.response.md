Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their desired counts equal to their current counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If there is at least one color with a desired count greater than the current count, `right` is incremented by 1. `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain the same.**
