Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input values and implements the logic to determine if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists. It iterates through the list of Jedi Knights, updating the current counts of each color and checking if the desired counts are met. The program returns 'YES' if an interval with the prescribed color counts exists and 'NO' otherwise. The logic seems to cover all potential cases and the program should work correctly for all inputs within the given constraints.
