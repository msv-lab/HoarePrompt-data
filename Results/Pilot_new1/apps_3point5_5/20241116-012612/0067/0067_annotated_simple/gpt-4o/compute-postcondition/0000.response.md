Example Answer:
`x, y, z` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The values of `x, y, z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x, y, z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
