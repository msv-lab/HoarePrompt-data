The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to output the sum of three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the sum of three non-negative integers x, y, and z within the specified range. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the sum of three non-negative integers x, y, and z, where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.**
