The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints '-', if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints '+', otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
