Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The condition x is not greater than y + z is satisfied. x is greater or equal to y. x is equal to y. If z is 0, the program prints '0'. If z is not 0, the program prints '?' without modifying the values of x, y, and z.***
