Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It checks the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the conditions specified in the problem description and prints the correct result ('+', '-', '0', or '?') accordingly. The annotations also provide a summary of the program logic and the possible outcomes based on different scenarios, which align with the problem description. Since there is no case where the code deviates from the problem description, the correctness of the code is true.
