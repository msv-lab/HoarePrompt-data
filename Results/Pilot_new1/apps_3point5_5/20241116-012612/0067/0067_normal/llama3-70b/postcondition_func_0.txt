The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input and then compares them in a series of conditions. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x is equal to y, it further checks if z is 0 and prints '0', otherwise it prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, it prints '?'. The functionality of the function is to determine the relationship between the input integers x, y, and z and print the corresponding symbol.
