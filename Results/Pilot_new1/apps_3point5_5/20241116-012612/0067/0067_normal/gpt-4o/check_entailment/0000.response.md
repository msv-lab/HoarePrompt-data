Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on the input values. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-', if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+', and if neither of these conditions are met, it prints '?'. The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also align with the code logic and provide a clear explanation of the expected behavior.
