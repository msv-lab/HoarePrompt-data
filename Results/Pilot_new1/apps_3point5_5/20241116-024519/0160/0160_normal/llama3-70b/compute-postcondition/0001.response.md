Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained by mapping `int` to the input split by spaces. The values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers within the specified ranges, A is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **N and K are integers within the specified ranges, A is a list of integers obtained from input**
