Example Answer: 
max_divisor is assigned the maximum value between max_divisor and i. Since max_divisor is initially assigned the value of gcd, and gcd is divisible by i, max_divisor will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and i. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is 1, gcd is divisible by i.
Output State: **N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is 1, gcd is divisible by i**
