The function `func` reads two integers, N and K, from input. It then reads a list of N integers, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list, and finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor found. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly.
