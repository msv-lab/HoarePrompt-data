According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the range from 1 to the square root of x has at least one element. So, for the loop to execute, the `x` value must be such that its square root is at least 1. Additionally, the `i` value should start from 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
