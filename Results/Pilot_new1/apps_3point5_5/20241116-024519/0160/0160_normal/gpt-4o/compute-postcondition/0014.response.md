According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `i < int(math.sqrt(x))` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that may have been modified based on the conditions mentioned. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous value and `divisors` may have been updated based on the conditions within the loop body.
State: **`divisors` may have been updated based on the conditions within the loop body, `i` is the next integer after the previous value**
