Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by the value of `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the value of `x` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` now contains all the divisors of `x` including 1 and `x`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x` including 1 and `x`; `i` is 1**
