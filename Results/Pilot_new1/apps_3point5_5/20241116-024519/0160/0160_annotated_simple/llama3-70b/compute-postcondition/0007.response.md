According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`, `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **N is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`, `i` is 3**
