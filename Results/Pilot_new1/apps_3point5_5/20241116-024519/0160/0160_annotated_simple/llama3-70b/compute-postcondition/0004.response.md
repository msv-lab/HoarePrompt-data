Example Answer:
The `gcd` variable is updated by taking the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` value and the element at index `i` in the list `A`. Since `gcd` is initially set to the first element of list `A`, and `i` is 1, the new value of `gcd` will be the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` value and the second element of list `A`. 
Output State: **N is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and the second element of list `A`, `i` is 1**
