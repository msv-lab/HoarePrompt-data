Example Answer: 
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd // i`. Since all variables are positive integers, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum value between its current value and the result of the division. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers, and `max_divisor` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers, and `max_divisor` is updated accordingly**
