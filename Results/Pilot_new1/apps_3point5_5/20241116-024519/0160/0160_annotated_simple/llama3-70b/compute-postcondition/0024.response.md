According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i` are positive integers. If `gcd` is divisible by `i + 1` without any remainder, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i + 1`. Additionally, if `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted. Since the loop iterates until `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1.

State: **`gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers**
