According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers. If `gcd % i == 0`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers.**
