Example Answer:
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. As `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x // i` will be a valid divisor of `x`. Therefore, the output state is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including `i` and `x // i`, `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x` is a positive number.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including `i` and `x // i`, `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x` is a positive number**
