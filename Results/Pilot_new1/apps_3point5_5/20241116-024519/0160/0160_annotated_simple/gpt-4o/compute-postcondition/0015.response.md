Output State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to the square root of x. If x is divisible by i, both i and x // i are added to the divisors set. This process ensures that all divisors of x are included. If x is not a positive number, the loop does not execute and divisors remains an empty set.**
