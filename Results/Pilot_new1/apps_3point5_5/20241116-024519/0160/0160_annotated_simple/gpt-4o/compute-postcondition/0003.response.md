Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, which contains all the divisors of `x`. Since `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, the set `divisors` now includes `i` as one of the divisors of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including `i`, `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x` is a positive number.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` including `i`, `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, `x` is a positive number**
