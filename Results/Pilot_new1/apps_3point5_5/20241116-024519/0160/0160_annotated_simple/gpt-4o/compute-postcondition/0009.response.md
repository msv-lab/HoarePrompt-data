Postcondition: ***divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x. If x is divisible by i, then both i and x // i are added to the divisors set. This process covers all possible divisors of x, ensuring that the set contains all necessary values.***
