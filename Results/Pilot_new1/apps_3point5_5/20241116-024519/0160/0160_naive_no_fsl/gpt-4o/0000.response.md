Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values of N, K, and the list of integers A.
2. The program calculates the sum of all elements in the list A.
3. The program defines two functions: func_1 to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers, and func_2 to find all divisors of a given number.
4. The program then iterates through the divisors of the sum of A and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of A after the operations. If a divisor satisfies this condition, it is printed as the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
5. The program correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

Therefore, the program is correct in all cases and meets the requirements of the problem description.
