Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program takes input correctly and parses it into the required variables.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given time `t`.
3. The function then determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time calculated.
4. The output is the chosen route which is the correct answer according to the problem description.
5. The program handles multiple bus routes and calculates the correct output based on the given time `t`.
6. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description provided.
