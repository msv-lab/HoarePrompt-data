Output State: 
- `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions in the loop.
- `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time.
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1.
- If the list `bus_routes` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1.
- After each iteration, the loop updates `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the calculated `wait_time` and conditions.
