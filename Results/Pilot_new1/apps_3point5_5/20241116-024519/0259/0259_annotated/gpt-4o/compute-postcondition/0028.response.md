Example Answer:
`s_i` is assigned the value of `bus_routes[i][0]` and `d_i` is assigned the value of `bus_routes[i][1]`. The values of `bus_routes[i][0]` and `bus_routes[i][1]` are not provided, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, and `d_i` is assigned a value.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, and `d_i` is assigned a value**
