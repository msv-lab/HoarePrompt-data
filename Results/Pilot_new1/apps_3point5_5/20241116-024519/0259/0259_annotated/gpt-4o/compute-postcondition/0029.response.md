Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is already assigned a value. The output state will be `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, `d_i` is assigned a value, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, `d_i` is assigned a value, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
