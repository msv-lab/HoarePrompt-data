Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The initial states of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Since `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` will be a non-negative value. 
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is a non-negative value**
