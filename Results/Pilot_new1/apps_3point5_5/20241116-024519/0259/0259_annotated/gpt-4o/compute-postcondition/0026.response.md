Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time. `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route. After the if-else block executes, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum of the calculated wait times based on the conditions mentioned in the precondition. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios including when `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, ensuring the correct handling of different edge cases such as when `s_i >= t` or `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`.***
