The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the maximum wait time.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a bus route with two elements: the start time `s_i` and the destination time `d_i`.

The function returns the index of the chosen bus route with the minimum wait time based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
