Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The previous values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as mentioned.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as mentioned**
