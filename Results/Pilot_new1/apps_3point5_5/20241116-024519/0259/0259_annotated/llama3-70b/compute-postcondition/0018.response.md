Example Answer: 
`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, and since `time` is less than `min_time`, the value of `min_time` is updated to be equal to `time`. Therefore, the Output State is: The time variable is less than the min_time variable, and `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`.
Output State: **The time variable is less than the min_time variable, and `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`**
