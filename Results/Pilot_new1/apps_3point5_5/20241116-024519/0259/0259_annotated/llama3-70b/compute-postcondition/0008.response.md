According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. To execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`**
