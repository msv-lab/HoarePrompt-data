`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split by space. The values of `s` and `d` are now determined based on user input. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
