Example Answer:
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values, `i` is incremented, `wait_time` is 0**
