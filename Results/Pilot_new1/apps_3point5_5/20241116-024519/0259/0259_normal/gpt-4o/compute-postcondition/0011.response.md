Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `s_i` is less than `t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
