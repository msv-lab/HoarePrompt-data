Example Answer:
The `wait_time` variable is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given the initial state, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i) is not equal to 0. Therefore, the `wait_time` is calculated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i) is not equal to 0, `wait_time` is calculated based on the given formula**
