Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route respectively. The function iterates through the bus routes, calculates the minimum wait time for each route based on the arrival time and interval, and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1. If `n` is 0, the function does not execute the loop and returns -1 as the chosen route.**
