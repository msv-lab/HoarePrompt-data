Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are not specified in the initial state, so after execution, the `buses` list will contain an additional tuple with unknown values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple**
