Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `s` and `d` are dependent on the input provided. The `buses` list contains tuples `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 101, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 101, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple**
