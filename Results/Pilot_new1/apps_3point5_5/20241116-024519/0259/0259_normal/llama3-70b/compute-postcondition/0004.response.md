Example Answer:
The tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained from splitting the input string into integers. The initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list, so after execution, the list `buses` will contain the tuple `(s, d)`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
