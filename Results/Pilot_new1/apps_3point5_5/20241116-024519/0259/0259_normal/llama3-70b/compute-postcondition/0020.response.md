Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the tuple in `buses` plus 1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in `buses`, and the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new time value, and `ans` is updated to the index of the tuple plus 1.***
