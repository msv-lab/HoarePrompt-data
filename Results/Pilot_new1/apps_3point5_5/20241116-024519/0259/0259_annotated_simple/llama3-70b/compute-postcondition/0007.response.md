Example Answer: 
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the input split into integers. The previous state of the variables `n` and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the updated list of tuples.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the updated list of tuples**
