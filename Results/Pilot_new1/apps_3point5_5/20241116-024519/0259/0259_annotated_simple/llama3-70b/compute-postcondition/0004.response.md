Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the input split into integers. The `buses` list now contains the tuple `(s, d)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input split into integers**
