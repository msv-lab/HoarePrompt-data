Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. The variables `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list**
