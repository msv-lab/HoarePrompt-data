Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is an unknown variable. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
