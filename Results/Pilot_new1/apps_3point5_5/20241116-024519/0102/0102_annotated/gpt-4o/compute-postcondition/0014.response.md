Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and `tens` is a list of strings representing tens digits from 0 to 90. The value of `n` is not between 11 and 19. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens digit of the integer 'n' from the 'tens' list. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the tens and ones digits of the integer `n` separated by a hyphen. The program covers all cases for the given range of `n` and ensures the correct representation of the tens and ones digits.***
