Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 0 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9; `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers. If s < 10, the string at index s in the `ones` list is printed. If s is between 10 and 19, the string at index s - 10 in the `teens` list is printed. If s is between 20 and 99, the string representation of s is printed based on the `ones` and `tens` lists. The program correctly handles all edge cases and prints the corresponding string representation of the input integer s.***
