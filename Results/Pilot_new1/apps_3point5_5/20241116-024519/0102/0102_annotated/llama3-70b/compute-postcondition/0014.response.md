Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It takes an integer input `s` between 0 and 99 and prints out the string representation of that number. It handles cases where `s` is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and between 20 and 99 by constructing the string based on the `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` lists. The function ensures that the input integer `s` falls within the specified range and correctly outputs the corresponding string representation.**
