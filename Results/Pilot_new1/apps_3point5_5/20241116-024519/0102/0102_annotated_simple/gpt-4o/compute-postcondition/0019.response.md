Functionality: **The function func_1 takes an integer n and returns the string representation of the tens and ones digits of n based on specific conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the 'ones' list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string from the 'teens' list. For n between 10 and 99, if the ones digit is 0, it returns the string representing the tens digit. Otherwise, it returns the combined string representation of the tens and ones digits separated by a hyphen. The function accurately handles the conversion of integers to their word representations for various ranges and edge cases.**
