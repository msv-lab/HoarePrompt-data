The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function returns the updated value of variable x based on the value of multiplier. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the updated value of variable x based on the value of multiplier.
