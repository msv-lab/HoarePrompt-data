The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates the value of 'x' by multiplying `n` with a multiplier based on `k` and the greatest common divisor of `n` and the multiplier. The function then returns the calculated value of 'x'.
