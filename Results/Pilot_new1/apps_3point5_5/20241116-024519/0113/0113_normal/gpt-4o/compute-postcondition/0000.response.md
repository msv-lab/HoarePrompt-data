Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` can be any value between `0` and `8`, the value of `multiplier` can be `1`, `10`, `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, `1000000`, `10000000`, or `100000000`. Therefore, the Output State is: `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
