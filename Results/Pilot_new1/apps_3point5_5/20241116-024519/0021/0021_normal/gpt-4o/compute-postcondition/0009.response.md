Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the maximum distance among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` and prints it. The previous values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are calculated based on the initial state provided. The maximum distance is the maximum value among these calculated distances. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and the `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and the `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4**.
