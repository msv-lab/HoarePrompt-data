Example Answer:
`max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are given in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99, `dist2` is an integer, `dist3` is the distance of the element at index 0 from the element 1, `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99, `dist2` is an integer, `dist3` is the distance of the element at index 0 from the element 1, `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4**
