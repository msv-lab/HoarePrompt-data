Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of each integer in the list from the boundaries (0 and `n-1`), and prints the maximum distance among all integers in the list. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but relies on user input for `n` and the list of integers. **
