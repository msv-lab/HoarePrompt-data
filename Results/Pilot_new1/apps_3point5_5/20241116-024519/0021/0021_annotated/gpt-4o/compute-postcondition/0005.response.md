Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`. The value of `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 100, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, and `max_pos` is constrained to be within the range of the list indices. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99, and `dist2` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99, and `dist2` is an integer**
