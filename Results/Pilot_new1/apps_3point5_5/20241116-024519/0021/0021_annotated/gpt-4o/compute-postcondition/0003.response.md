Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the element `n` in list `a`. Since `n` is the maximum value in list `a`, `max_pos` will be the index of `n`. The value of `n` can be any integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, so the index of `n` will be between 0 and `n-1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, and `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`**
