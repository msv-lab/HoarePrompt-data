Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list `a`, subtracts 1 from the absolute difference, and compares it to n - 2. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the maximum distance can be calculated. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a, and `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list a.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list a**
