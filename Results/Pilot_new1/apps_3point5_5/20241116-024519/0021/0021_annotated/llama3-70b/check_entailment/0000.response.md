Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be seen that the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code takes the input of a permutation of size n, finds the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n), calculates the maximum possible distance between them by performing exactly one swap, and then prints this maximum distance. The code handles the scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements are at the opposite ends of the array, as well as when they are already at the maximum possible distance from each other. The annotations also accurately describe what the code is doing, and there are no cases identified where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
