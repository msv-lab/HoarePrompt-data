Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`; `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99; `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and the index of n in list `a`; `dist3` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and the index of 1 in list `a`**
