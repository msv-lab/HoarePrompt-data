Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 100. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**.
