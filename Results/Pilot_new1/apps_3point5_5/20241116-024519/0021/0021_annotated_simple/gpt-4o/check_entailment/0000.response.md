Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input, finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, calculating the distances between these elements and the ends of the array, and then finding the maximum distance. It then prints the maximum distance achieved by performing exactly one swap. The logic provided in the code is correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
