Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values of `n` distinct integers obtained by mapping the input to integers. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, and each integer in the list `a` is between 1 and `n`, the output state is: n is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`.
Output State: **n is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`**
