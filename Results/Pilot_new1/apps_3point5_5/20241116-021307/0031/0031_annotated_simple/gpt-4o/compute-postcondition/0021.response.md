Output State: If k is greater than 0, `numerator` will be the product of all values from 1 to `total_days` shifted left by `n`, modulo `MOD`, `denominator` will be the product of all values from 1 to `total_days`, modulo `MOD`, and `p_no_shared` will be assigned the value of `numerator`. If k is 0 or lower, `numerator` and `denominator` will remain as 1. `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. After executing the code snippet, `p_shared` will be calculated as the result of the expression `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
