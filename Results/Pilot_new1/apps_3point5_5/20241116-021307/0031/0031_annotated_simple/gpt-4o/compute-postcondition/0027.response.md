Output State: If k is greater than 0, `numerator` is the product of all values from 1 to `total_days` shifted left by `n` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is the product of all values from 1 to `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is `numerator`, `p_shared` is `A` after floor division by `g`, `p_total` is `denominator`, `B` is `p_total`. If k is 0 or lower, `numerator` and `denominator` are 1, `B` is updated by floor division with `g`. Then, `A % MOD` and `B % MOD` are printed.
Output State: **`numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_shared`, `p_total`, `B` are updated based on conditions, and `A % MOD` and `B % MOD` are printed.**
