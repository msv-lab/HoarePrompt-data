The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition is that both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function calculates MOD as 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program returns nothing. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, calculate MOD as 1000003, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, it returns nothing. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k, calculates MOD as 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, it returns nothing.**
