According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1, and denominator is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` is now 0, and the total_days should be 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1, and denominator is 1.
State: **`total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
