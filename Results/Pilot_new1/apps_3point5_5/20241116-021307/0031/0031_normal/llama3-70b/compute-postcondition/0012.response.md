According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)` and then by `(total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `n` squared, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
