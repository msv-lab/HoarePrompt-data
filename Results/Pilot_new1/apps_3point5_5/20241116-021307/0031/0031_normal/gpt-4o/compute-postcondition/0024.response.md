Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with arguments A and B. A is the calculated value of p_shared, and B is the value of the denominator. The function `func_1` will perform some operation on A and B, but the specific details are unknown. Therefore, the output state after executing this code is: numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k, denominator is the product of total_days for each i in the range of k, MOD is 1000003; p_no_shared is 1, p_total is the value of denominator, p_shared is the result of the expression (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of the denominator.
Output State: **numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k, denominator is the product of total_days for each i in the range of k, MOD is 1000003; p_no_shared is 1, p_total is the value of denominator, p_shared is the result of the expression (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of the denominator**
