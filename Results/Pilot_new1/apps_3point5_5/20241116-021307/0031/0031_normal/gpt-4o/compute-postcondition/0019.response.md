Example Answer: 
`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, and `numerator` is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, so `numerator` remains 1. Therefore, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k, denominator is the product of total_days for each i in the range of k, MOD is 1000003; p_no_shared is 1**
