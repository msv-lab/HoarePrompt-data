According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 left shifted by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
