Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. p_total is assigned the value of denominator. p_shared is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD. The result of this calculation is stored in p_shared.
Output State: **If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. p_total is assigned the value of denominator. p_shared is the result of the calculation (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD.**
