Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. p_total is assigned the value of denominator. p_shared is the result of the calculation (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD. Variable A is assigned the value of p_shared. The values of p_no_shared, p_total, and p_shared depend on the values of k, numerator, and denominator. Therefore, the Output State is: If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator; if k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; p_shared is the result of the calculation (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; A is assigned the value of p_shared.
