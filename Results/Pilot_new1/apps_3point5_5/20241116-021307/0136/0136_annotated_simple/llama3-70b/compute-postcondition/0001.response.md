Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the input value after removing any leading zeros. The input is taken from the user, so the value of `b` will be the input value without leading zeros. The value of `a` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input value without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input value without leading zeros**
