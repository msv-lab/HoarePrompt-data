Example Answer:
The code removes leading zeros from the string `a`. If `a` had leading zeros, they are removed, and the resulting value is stored back in `a`. The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits**
