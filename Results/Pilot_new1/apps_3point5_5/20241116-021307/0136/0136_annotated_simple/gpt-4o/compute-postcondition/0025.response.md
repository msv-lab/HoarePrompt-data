Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros represented as strings with at most 10^6 digits. If `a` is an empty string, it is assigned the value '0'. If `b` is an empty string or evaluates to False, it is assigned the value '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The postcondition covers all edge cases including when `a` and `b` are empty strings or evaluate to False.***
