Example Answer:
The `input()` function accepts input and splits it into a list called `data`. The values in the list are assigned to variables `a` and `b`. Given that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits**
