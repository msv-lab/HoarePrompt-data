Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` after removing any leading zeros. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits, `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits**
