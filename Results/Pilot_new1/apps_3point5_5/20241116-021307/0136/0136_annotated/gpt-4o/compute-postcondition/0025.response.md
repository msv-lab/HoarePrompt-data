Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` evaluates to False, then `a` is assigned the string '0'. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `b` is False, it is assigned the string '0'. The program compares `a` and `b` based on their lengths and integer values. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, the program compares the integer values represented by `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. This covers all possible scenarios for the comparison of `a` and `b` considering their lengths and integer representations.***
