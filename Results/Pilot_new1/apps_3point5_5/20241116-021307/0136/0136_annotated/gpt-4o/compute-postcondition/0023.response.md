Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. The length of `a` is greater or equal to the length of `b`. If the integer value represented by `a` is less than the integer value represented by `b`, the program prints '<'. If the integer value represented by `a` is greater than the integer value represented by `b`, the program prints '>'. If the integer value represented by `a` is equal to the integer value represented by `b`, the program prints '='. This covers all possible cases where `a` and `b` satisfy the given conditions.***
