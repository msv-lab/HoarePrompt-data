Example Answer:
The value of `a` is reassigned to the first element of the `data` list with leading zeros removed. Since `a` is initially a non-negative integer represented as a string, removing leading zeros does not change the value. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
