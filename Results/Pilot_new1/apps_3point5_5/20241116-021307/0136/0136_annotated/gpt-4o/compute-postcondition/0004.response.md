Example Answer:
The string `a` is assigned the value `'0'`, which evaluates to False in Python. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` evaluates to False, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` evaluates to False, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
