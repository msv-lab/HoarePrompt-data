Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the result of removing leading zeros from the input, which is stored as a string. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros**
