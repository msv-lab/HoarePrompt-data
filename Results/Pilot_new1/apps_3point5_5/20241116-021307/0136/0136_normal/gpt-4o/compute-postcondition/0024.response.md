Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the split input values, `a` is '0' with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0'. If `b` is falsy, then `b` is set to '0'. If `a` is a falsy value, then `a` is also set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
