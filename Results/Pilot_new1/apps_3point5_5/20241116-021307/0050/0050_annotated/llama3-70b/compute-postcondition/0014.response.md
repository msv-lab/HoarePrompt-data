Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged**
