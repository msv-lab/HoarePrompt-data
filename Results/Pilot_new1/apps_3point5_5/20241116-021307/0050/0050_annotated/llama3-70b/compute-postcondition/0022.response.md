Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are adjusted based on the condition `r >= s[i]` in the previous iteration. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is not greater than or equal to `s[i]`, the loop breaks. All variables maintain their initial properties and relationships after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the consistency of the program state.***
