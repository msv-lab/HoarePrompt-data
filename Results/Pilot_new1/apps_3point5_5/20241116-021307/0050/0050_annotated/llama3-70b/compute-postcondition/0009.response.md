Example Answer:
The value of `r` is modified by taking the modulus of `r` with `s[i]`. The previous values of `r` and `s[i]` are known. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged**
