Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split and converted to integers. The values of `b` are dependent on the input provided. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input**
