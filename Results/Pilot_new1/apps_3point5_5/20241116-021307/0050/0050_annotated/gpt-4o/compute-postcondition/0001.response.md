Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted to integers, creating a list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers**
