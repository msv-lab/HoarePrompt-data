Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. The value of `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, and `r` is an integer. Therefore, `max_shares` is calculated based on these values. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated based on the values of `r` and `min_buy_price`**
