Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element of the input split by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input split**
