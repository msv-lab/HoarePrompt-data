The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as two lists `s` and `b`. It then sorts the lists, calculates the number of shares based on certain conditions, and updates the value of `r` accordingly. The function iterates through the sorted list `b` and modifies `r` based on the calculated shares. Finally, it prints the updated value of `r`. The function does not have a specific return value and operates based on the provided input and conditions.
