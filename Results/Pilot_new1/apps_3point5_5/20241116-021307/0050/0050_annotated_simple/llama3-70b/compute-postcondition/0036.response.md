Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
