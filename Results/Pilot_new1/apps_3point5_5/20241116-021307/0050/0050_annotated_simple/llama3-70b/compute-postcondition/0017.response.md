Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer. If r >= s[i], `shares` is updated by adding the result of r divided by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of the division. If r < s[i], the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
