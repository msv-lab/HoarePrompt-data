Example Answer:
The value of `r` is divided by `s[i]` and the result is added to `shares`. The previous values of `r`, `shares`, and `s[i]` are known. Therefore, the updated value of `shares` is `shares + r // s[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than the current value of `i`, `m` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer, updated `shares` is `shares + r // s[i]`**
