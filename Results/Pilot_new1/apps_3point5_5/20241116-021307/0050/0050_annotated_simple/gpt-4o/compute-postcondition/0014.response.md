Functionality: The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as lists `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it computes the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, calculates the remaining money after buying those shares, and then determines the total money by selling those shares at the maximum price. Finally, it prints the total money. The function does not explicitly return any value.
