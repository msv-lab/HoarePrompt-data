Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by first sorting the buy and sell prices in ascending and descending order respectively. Then it iterates through the buy prices to buy as many shares as possible using the available money. After that, it iterates through the sell prices to sell all the bought shares. The program keeps track of the remaining money after each transaction and updates the total money accordingly. The logic implemented in the code covers all possible scenarios and correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening.
