Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm is correct and will always return the correct greatest common divisor for any two positive integers. Since the function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor, it can be used in the context of the problem description to find the maximal greatest common divisor for the sequence of positive numbers. The function itself is correct and will work as expected in all cases.
