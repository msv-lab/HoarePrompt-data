According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` being positive integers does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are positive integers, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`**
