Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. The initial values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are positive integers. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. No other variables are affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1**
