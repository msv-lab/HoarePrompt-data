Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k. It calculates the minimum sum based on k, and if that sum is greater than n, it returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a sequence list by repeating the sum values and incrementing certain elements until the remainder becomes 0. The function then returns the updated sequence list. If k is greater than n or min_sum, the function returns -1.**
