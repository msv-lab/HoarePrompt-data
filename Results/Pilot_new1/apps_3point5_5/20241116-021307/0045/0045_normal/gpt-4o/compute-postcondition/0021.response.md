Output State: **`sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, the range depends on `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2. `d` is the starting value of the multiples. `i` is -1 and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The element at index `i` in `sequence` is incremented by 1.**
