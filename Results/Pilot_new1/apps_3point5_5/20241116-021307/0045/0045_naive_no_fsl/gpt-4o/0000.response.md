Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of the sequence based on the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, in which case it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It then calculates the remainder by subtracting d times the minimum sum from n.
5. It constructs the sequence by creating k numbers where each element is d times the index + 1.
6. It then adjusts the sequence by incrementing the elements by 1 to distribute the remainder among the elements.
7. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise returns -1.
