According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there are no changes in the variables. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `k` needs to be greater than 1.
State: **No change in the state of the variables, `k` is greater than 1**
