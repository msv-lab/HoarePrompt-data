Example Answer:
The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is a positive integer. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` is calculated using the formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers**
