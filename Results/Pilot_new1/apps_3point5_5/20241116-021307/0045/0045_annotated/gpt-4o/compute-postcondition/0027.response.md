Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers and checks if this sum is greater than `n`. If the sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it constructs a sequence list based on the division of `n` by `min_sum` and adjusts the elements in the list based on the remainder. The function then returns the final state of the sequence list after the loop execution.**
