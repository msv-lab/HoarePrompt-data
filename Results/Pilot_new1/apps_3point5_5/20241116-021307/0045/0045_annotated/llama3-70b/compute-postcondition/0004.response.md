Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `b` is truthy, meaning it has a non-zero value, the modulo operation will be performed. The output state will reflect the updated values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, `b` is truthy**
