The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. After the loop execution, the function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, where `a` contains the GCD and `b` is 0. If either `a` or `b` is 0, the loop does not execute. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b, with `a` containing the GCD and `b` being 0 after the loop execution, while handling the case where either `a` or `b` is 0. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, returns the GCD of the initial values of a and b, where a contains the GCD and b is 0 after the loop execution. If either a or b is 0, the loop does not execute.**
