Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sequence of k positive numbers that are strictly increasing, sum up to n, and have the maximum greatest common divisor. The program first calculates the minimum possible sum of k numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. If this minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence. Otherwise, it calculates the common divisor d and the remainder. It then constructs the sequence by assigning d * (i + 1) to each element and distributes the remainder to maximize the greatest common divisor. The program handles all cases correctly and provides the correct output.
