Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the side lengths of the starting and ending equilateral triangles respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

The logic used in the program is correct. It calculates the difference between x and y, divides it by 2, and adds the remainder if the difference is odd. This is because in each operation, Memory can decrease the side length by 2 units. If the difference is odd, then he needs one more operation to reduce the side length to y.

The program handles all potential cases correctly and gives the expected output for the given test cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
