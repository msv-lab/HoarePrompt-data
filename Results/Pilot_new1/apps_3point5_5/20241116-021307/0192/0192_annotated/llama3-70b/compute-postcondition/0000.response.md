Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. Since the input is expected to be two integers separated by a space, `x` and `y` will take those values. The values of `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
