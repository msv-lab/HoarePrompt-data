Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, as it simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
