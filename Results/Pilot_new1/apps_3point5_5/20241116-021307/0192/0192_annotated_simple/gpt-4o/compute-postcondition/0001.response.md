Example Answer:
The expression calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2. Given that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be 1, as the difference between x and y will always be an even number. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the result of the expression is always 1.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000 and the result of the expression is always 1**
