Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the restriction that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the program may output a number that is not actually achievable with the given cubes. For example, if the input is:
```
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
The program would output 98 as the maximum number, but in reality, Masha cannot create the number 98 with the given cubes because there is no cube with the digit 9 that can be rotated to form the number 8.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
