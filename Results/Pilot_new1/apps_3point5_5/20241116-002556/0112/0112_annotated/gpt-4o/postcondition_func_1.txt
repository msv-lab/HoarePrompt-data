The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`. It iterates over the elements in the list `digits` that are obtained from `num`, and updates all elements in the list `used_cubes` based on certain conditions. If the condition is not met for any element, the function returns False. If the condition is met for all elements, the function returns True. The function does not handle cases where `num` is not within the range 1 to 3 or where the input is invalid.
