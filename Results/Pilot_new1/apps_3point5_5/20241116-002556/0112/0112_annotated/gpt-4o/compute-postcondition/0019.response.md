Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is `True`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration after the if else block executes. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the loop is broken. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
