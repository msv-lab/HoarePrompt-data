According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]`. If this condition is satisfied and `found` is `True`, the loop terminates prematurely. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used_cubes` have been updated based on the condition, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is either `True` or `False` based on the condition, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- If the condition was not met in the last iteration, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to `False` for the next iteration.
- If the condition was met in the last iteration and `found` is `True`, then `i` should be set to `n` to terminate the loop prematurely.
- If the condition was met in the last iteration but `found` is `False`, then `i` should be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next element in the loop.

State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated based on the condition, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is either `True` or `False` based on the condition, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration.**
