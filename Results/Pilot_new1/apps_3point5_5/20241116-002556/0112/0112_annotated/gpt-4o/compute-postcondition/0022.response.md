Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated based on the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]`. The list `digits` still has at least 1 element. The variable `found` is `True` if the condition is satisfied for at least one element, and `False` otherwise. The variable `n` remains greater than 0, and the variable `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration after the if-else block executes. If the condition is never met for any element in the loop, `found` remains `False`, and the loop completes all `n` iterations without any changes to `used_cubes`.***
