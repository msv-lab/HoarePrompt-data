The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The precondition for `num` is that it is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 3. The function also accepts a list `cube_faces` of `n` lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube.

After executing the function body, the function iterates over the elements in the list `digits` and updates all elements in the list `used_cubes` based on the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]`. The loop will execute at least once if `digits` has at least one element. The variable `found` is True if the condition is satisfied for at least one element, and False otherwise. If `found` remains False after the loop completes all `n` iterations, the program returns False. If the loop does not execute due to an empty `digits` list, no changes occur to `used_cubes`, and `found` remains False.

In Case 2, the program returns True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, iterate over the elements in the list `digits`, update `used_cubes` based on certain conditions, and return True if the conditions are met. If the conditions are not met after iterating over all elements, the function returns False.
