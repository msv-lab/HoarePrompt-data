Example Answer:
`found` is assigned the value `False`, changing its state from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is False, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is False, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is adjusted accordingly**
