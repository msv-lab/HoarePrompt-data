Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` iterates through the cubes to create a set of unique numbers on each cube face. Then, it finds the smallest number x that cannot be formed with the unique numbers on the faces of the cubes by incrementing x until a number cannot be formed. This aligns with the problem description of finding the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes.
- The function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces provided. It iterates through each digit of the number and checks if it can be formed with the available cube faces. If a digit cannot be formed, the function returns False, otherwise it returns True. This logic ensures that the code accurately determines if a number can be formed using the cube faces, which is in line with the problem description.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The output hints also support this assessment by detailing the functions' purposes and how they contribute to the desired outcome.
