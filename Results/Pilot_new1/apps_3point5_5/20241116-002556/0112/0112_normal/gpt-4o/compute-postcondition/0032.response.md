The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if the corresponding cube face contains the current `digit`. The function also has variables `found` and `digit` which progress through the characters in `digits`. 

In Case_1, if `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False. If the condition is not met in the loop and `found` is False, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program returns True in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a list `num`, iterate through the elements to check if the digit is found in any cube face, and return True if found. If not found and `n` is 0 or less, it returns False.
