Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with at least 1 character. `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is True if `i` is the index of the cube face containing the `digit` character. `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list. `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any cube face, otherwise False. `i` is in the range of 0 to n-1. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block, ensuring the correct handling of the cube faces and digits.***
