According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more characters in `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses to the next character in `digits`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `digits` must have more characters and `digit` should progress to the next character in `digits`. 
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses to the next character in `digits`**
