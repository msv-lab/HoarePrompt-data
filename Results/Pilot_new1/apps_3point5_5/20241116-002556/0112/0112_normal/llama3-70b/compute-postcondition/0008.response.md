Example Answer:
The set `digits` is updated with the digits of the third cube in the list `cube`. Since `cube` is the third cube in the list `cubes`, the digits of the third cube are added to the set `digits`. The set `digits` now contains the digits of the third cube along with any additional digits from the update operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, `cube` is the third cube in the list, and `digits` is a set containing the digits of the third cube along with any additional digits from the update operation**
