Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube in the list and converts it to a string, then adds it to the set `digits`. Since the cube is the first cube in the list, the list is not affected. The set `digits` is updated with the digits of the cube. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube**
