Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the first cube and converts it to a string before adding it to the set `digits`. Since the cube is the first cube in the list, its digits are converted to strings and added to the set `digits`. The initial state is `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the cubes list. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube**
