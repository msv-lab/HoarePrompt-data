Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if it exists, sorts the digits in descending order, and then constructs the maximum number possible. The logic used in the program follows the problem description accurately. Additionally, the program accounts for the constraint that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program is correct for all potential cases.
