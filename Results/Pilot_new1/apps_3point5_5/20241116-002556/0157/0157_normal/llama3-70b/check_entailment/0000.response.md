Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes in the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, and calculates the maximum total number of fruits he can use to cook the compote based on the ratio 1:2:4. It then prints the result. The code correctly calculates the minimum amount of lemons that can be used based on the inputs, ensuring that Nikolay follows the 1:2:4 ratio for the compote. The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. The output hints also agree with the code and describe the functionality accurately.
