Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` and `c` are input integers, the value of `max_lemons` will be the minimum of these three values. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
