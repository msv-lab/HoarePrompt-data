Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, the value of `b` is an input integer, and the value of `c` is an input integer. After calculation, `max_lemons` will hold the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
