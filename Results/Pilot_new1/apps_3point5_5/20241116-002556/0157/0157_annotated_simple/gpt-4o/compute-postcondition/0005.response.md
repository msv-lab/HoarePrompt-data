Example Answer:
The value of `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `total_fruits` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Finally, the program prints the value of `total_fruits`. The initial state is `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c**
