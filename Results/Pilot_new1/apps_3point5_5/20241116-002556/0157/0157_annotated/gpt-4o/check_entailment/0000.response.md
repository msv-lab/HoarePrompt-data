Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the minimum of ratios between the three inputs, then calculates the total number of fruits that can be obtained from those lemons. The output of the code matches the expected output provided in the problem description for all the examples given. The annotations also accurately describe what the code is doing in terms of calculations and output. Therefore, the code is correct.
