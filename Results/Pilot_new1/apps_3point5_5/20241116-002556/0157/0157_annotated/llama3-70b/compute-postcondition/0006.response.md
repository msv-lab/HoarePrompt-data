Functionality: **The function takes three positive integers a, b, and c as input, calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the values of a, b, and c, and then calculates the sum of the squares of this minimum number. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not positive integers or when the inputs are outside the specified ranges (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000).**
