Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three positive integers as input, calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the values of a, b, and c, and then calculates the sum of the squares of this minimum number. The code correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that for each lemon, there are exactly 2 apples and 4 pears in the compote. The code also handles cases where Nikolay may not have enough fruits to cook any compote, in which case it prints 0. The code logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, and the provided examples also produce the correct output. Therefore, the code is correct.
