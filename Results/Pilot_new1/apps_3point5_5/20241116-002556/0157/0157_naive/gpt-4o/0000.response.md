Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It ensures that the ratio of 1:2:4 is maintained by calculating the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the number of apples and pears available. The total number of fruits is then calculated using this maximum number of lemons. The program handles all potential cases where Nikolay may not have enough fruits of a particular type to make the compote, as specified in the problem description.
