Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The string `res` had its first character replaced once and then back to its original value, so after adding `char`, the new value of `res` will have the first character added as well. The variable `alphabet` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable.
Output State: **`s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable**
