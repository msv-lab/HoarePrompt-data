Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is known to have the added character, and `char` is the character being added. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
