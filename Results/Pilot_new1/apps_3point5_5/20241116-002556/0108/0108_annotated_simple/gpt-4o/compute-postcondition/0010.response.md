Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1 based on the comparison of characters in `s` and `target. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables `i` and `j`.***
