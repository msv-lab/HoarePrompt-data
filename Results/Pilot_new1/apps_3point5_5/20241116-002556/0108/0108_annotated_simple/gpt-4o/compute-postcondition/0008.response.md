According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is an integer where if the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, `j` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `j` needs to be adjusted based on the comparison of characters in `s` and `target`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is adjusted based on the comparison of characters in `s` and `target**.
