Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the English alphabet and replaces characters in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. It then checks if the resulting string contains all the English alphabet characters in order. If it does, it prints the resulting string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
