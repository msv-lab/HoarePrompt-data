Output State: **If the characters in string `s` match the characters in string `target` in order, `i` will be the length of `s`, `j` will be 26. If the characters do not match, `i` will be less than the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `i` is equal to the length of `s` but `j` is less than 26, it means some characters in `target` were not found in `s`. If `j` is 26 but `i` is less than the length of `s`, it means some characters in `s` were not part of `target`.**
