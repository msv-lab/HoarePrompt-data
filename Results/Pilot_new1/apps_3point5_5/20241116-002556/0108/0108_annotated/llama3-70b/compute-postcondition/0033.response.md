Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced in the string `s` with the next character in the alphabet after `char`. The replacement occurs only once. The previous value of `char` is unknown, and the previous value of `s` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end.
Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end**
