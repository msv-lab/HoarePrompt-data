According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the last character in the alphabet incremented by 1, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, and `res` is a string with the last character in the alphabet added to the end. For the loop to execute one more time, the last character in `s` needs to be adjusted to the next character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the last character in the alphabet added to the end**
