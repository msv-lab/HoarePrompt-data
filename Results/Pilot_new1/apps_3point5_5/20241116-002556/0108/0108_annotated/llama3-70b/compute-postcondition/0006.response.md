According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, and `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the alphabet after the last replaced `char` in `s` should now contain `char`, and `char` should still be present in `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with the next occurrence of `char` replaced by the character after it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end**
