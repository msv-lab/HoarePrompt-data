According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with an additional character, and `alphabet` is a valid iterable. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with an additional character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
