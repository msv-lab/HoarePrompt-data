Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The previous state of `res` is a string with an additional character. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` is a string with an additional character and `char` is added to the end of `res`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` is a string with an additional character and `char` is added to the end of `res`**
