Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The string `s` consists of small English letters, so `char` is a small English letter. Therefore, the length of the string `res` increases by 1 with the addition of `char`. The string `alphabet` is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with an additional character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
