According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is concatenated with `char`, and `s` is updated after the replacement operation. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` must still be in the updated `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **variable `res` is concatenated with variable `char`, `s` is updated after replacement operation, and `char` is still in the updated `s`**
