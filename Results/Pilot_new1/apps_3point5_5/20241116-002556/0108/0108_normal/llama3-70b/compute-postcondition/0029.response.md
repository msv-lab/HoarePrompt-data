Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is added to the value of `res`. `char` is the character one position behind the updated `char` in the ASCII table, so the value of `char` is one less than the character that was updated in `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, `res` is adjusted accordingly, `char` is the character one position behind the updated `char` in the ASCII table.
Output State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, `res` is adjusted accordingly, `char` is the character one position behind the updated `char` in the ASCII table**
