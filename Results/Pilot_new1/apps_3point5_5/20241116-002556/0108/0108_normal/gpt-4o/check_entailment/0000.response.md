Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string input `s` that consists of only small English letters and compares `s` with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. It iterates through both strings and checks if the characters match. If `s` matches the target string up to the length of the target string, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The code correctly handles the case where the input string is empty, in which it prints -1. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints align with the code's functionality.
