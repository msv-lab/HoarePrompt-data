According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1. This means that the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1**
