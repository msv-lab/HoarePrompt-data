Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. 
- `func_1` checks if the number of unique characters in the string representation of a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`. This function correctly evaluates whether a number contains at most `k` different digits.
- `func_2` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It iterates over the range [l, r], checks if each number satisfies the condition using `func_1`, and adds it to the total sum if it does. The total sum is taken modulo `MOD` and returned. 
- The code seems to correctly implement the problem description for all potential cases, as it handles the input constraints and calculates the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits within the given range. 
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
