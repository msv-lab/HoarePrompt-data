According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` remains less than or equal to `r`, and `num` stays within the range of `l` to `r` as specified by `func_1(num, k)`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `num` should be adjusted to the next number after the current `num` and should still be within the range of `l` to `r`. Additionally, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` should be updated accordingly.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` remains less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is the next number after the last iteration within the range of `l` to `r` as specified by `func_1(num, k)`**
