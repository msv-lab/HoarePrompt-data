According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0, so to ensure the loop executes, `l` should be less than or equal to `r` and `num` should be equal to `l`.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
