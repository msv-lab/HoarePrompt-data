Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the function `func_1` which calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It utilizes the `count` function to perform the necessary calculations.
- The `count` function correctly handles the cases where `k` is 0, where the key `(n, k)` is already in the dictionary `dp`, and where `n` is less than `10**k`. It also correctly calculates the values based on the provided formula and stores them in the dictionary `dp`.
- The output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of how the functions work. The provided examples also show that the code is able to correctly calculate the sum of numbers based on the given constraints.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the implementation aligns with the provided description and output hints.
