Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The function uses a dynamic programming approach to efficiently calculate the sum.

The function `count` within `func_1` correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits between `0` and a given number `n`. This count is then used to calculate the sum of numbers between `l` and `r` that satisfy the condition.

The program reads the input values for `l`, `r`, and `k` correctly, calls the `func_1` function with these values, and prints the result modulo `998244353`. 

For all possible inputs within the given constraints, the program correctly calculates the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits between `l` and `r`, making the program correct.
