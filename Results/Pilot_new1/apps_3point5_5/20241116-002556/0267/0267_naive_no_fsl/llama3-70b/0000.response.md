Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits.

The function correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r`. The calculation of the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits is done according to the problem description.

The input is correctly read and passed to the `func_1` function, and the output is printed as required. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
