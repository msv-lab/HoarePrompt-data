Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, to check if a number contains at most k different digits and calculate the sum of numbers from l to r meeting this condition, respectively. The input is taken correctly and the main logic of iterating through the numbers from l to r and checking if they meet the condition is implemented. The sum is calculated correctly and returned modulo 998244353. The logic seems to be correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program also produces the expected output for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
