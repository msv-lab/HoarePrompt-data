According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` has the key (n, k) with a value of 9 + 9 * 10. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `k`. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a value of 9 + 9 * 10, `i` is equal to `k`**
