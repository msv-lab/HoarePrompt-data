Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Since there are no constraints on the values of `n` and `k` in the initial state, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, the function returns the value associated with that key. Otherwise, n is less than 10 to the power of k.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, the function returns the value associated with that key. Otherwise, n is less than 10 to the power of k**
