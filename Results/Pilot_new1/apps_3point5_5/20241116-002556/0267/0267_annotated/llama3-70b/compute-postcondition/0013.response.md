Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9 + 9 * 10, `i` is equal to `k`, and `k` is a positive integer. After the calculation, the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a new calculated value, and `i` is equal to `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the key (n, k) with a new calculated value, and `i` is equal to `k`**
