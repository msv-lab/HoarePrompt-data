According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the updated value for key (n, k), and `i` is less than `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the updated value for key (n, k), and `i` is less than or equal to `k`**
