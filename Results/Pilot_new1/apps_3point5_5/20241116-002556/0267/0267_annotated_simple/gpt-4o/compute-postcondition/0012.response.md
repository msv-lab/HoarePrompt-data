Output State: **`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to be the sum of the current `total_sum` and `num`, modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged, with `l` being less than or equal to `r`, and `num` retains its initial value of `l`. There are no changes if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and there are no changes to the variables.**
