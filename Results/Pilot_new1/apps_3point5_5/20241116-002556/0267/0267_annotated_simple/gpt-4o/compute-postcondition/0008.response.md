According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range specified by `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is less than `r` and `num` retains its initial value of `l`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` should remain less than `r` and `num` should be updated to the next integer value after the previous iteration. Additionally, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of the variables.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` is less than `r` and `num` is the next integer value after the previous iteration.**
