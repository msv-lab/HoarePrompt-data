Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `dp[n, k]` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is increased by 1**
