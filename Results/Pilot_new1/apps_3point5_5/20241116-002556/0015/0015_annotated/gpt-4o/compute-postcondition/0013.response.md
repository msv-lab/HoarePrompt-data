Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, the following cases are considered: if `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. This if-else block covers all possible scenarios based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c, ensuring the correct output 'YES' or 'NO' is displayed.***
