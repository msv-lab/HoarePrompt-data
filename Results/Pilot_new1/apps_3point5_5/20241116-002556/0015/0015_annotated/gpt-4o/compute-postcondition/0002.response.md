Example Answer: 
The code prints 'YES' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and `b` is equal to `a`. The print statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is equal to `a`.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is equal to `a`**
