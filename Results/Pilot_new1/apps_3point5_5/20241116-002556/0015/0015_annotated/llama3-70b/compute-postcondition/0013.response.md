Postcondition: ***`a, b, c` are integers assigned based on user input. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the conditions ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) are met, the program prints 'YES'. If the conditions are not satisfied, the program prints 'NO'. In all cases, the values of `a, b, c` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
