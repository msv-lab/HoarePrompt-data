Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown until user input is provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9**
