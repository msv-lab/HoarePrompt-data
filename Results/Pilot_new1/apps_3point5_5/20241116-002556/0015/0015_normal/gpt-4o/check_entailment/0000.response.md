Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
- If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES' which is correct as Vasya's favorite number is the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO' which is correct as the difference between neighboring elements cannot be zero.
- If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, it prints 'YES'. This condition checks if Vasya's favorite number can be reached by adding the common difference `c` to the first element `a`. If this condition is satisfied, it means `b` can be reached in the sequence, hence 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
