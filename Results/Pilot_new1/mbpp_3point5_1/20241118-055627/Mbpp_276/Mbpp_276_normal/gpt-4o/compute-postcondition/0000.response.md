Example Answer:
The volume is calculated using the formula math.pi * radius ** 2 * height. The variables radius and height are non-negative numbers, so the calculation will result in a non-negative volume value. Therefore, the Output State is: radius and height are non-negative numbers; volume is a non-negative number.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers; volume is a non-negative number**
