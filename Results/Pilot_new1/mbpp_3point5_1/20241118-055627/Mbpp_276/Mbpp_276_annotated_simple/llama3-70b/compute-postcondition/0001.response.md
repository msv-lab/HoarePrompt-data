The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns the volume of a cylinder with the given `radius` and `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cylinder calculated using these values. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers, radius and height, and returns the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height.**
