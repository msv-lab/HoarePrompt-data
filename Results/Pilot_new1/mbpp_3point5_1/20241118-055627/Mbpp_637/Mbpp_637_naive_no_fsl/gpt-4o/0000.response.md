Correctness: True

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price, which indicates that there is no profit and no loss. The provided test cases cover all possible scenarios - where the cost price is not equal to the selling price, where they are equal, and where the selling price is higher than the cost price. In all these cases, the function returns the expected results. Therefore, the program is correct.
