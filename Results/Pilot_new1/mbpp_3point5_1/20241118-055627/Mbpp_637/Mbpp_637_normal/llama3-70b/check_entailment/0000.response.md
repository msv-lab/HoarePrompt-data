Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` is simple and straightforward. It checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price and returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. This logic directly aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should return True if there is no profit or loss (i.e., cost price equals selling price). There are no edge cases or potential scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not cover. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented as they state that the function returns True if the cost price is equal to the selling price. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
