Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It follows the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark composite numbers and then counts the remaining prime numbers. The logic of the program is sound, and it covers all potential cases as per the problem description. The program returns 0 for numbers less than or equal to 2, which is the correct behavior. Additionally, for numbers greater than 2, it correctly identifies prime numbers and returns the count. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct for all cases.
