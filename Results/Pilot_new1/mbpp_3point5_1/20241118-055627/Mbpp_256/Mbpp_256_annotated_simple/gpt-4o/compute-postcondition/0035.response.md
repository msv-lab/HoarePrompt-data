Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the elements at indices 3, 4, 6, 9 in `is_prime` are False. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for each multiple of `i` starting from `i` squared up to `n`, the corresponding index in the `is_prime` list is set to False. If `is_prime[i]` is False or `n` is less than or equal to 4, the loop does not execute.***
