According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 4 and `i` is 4. Additionally, the loop will execute if the range `i * i` to `n` is valid for `j`. For `j` to be valid, `i * i` should be less than `n`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the elements at indices 3, 4, 6, 9 in `is_prime` are False, `j` is `i * i` and `j` is less than `n`**
