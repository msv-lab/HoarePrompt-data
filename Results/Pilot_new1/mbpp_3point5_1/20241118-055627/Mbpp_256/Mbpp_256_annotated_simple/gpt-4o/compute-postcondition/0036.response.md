According to the code, the loop can execute again if `is_prime[i]` is True and `n` is greater than 4. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, and the conditions for setting elements in `is_prime` are as described. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 5 since the loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 5, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the elements at indices 3, 4, 6, 9 in `is_prime` are False.**
