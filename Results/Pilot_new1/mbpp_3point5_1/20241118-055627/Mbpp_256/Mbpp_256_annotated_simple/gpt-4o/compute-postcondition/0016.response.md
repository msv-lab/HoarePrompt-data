According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the element at index 2 in `is_prime` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than 4 (since `i` is 2), `i` should be 3 (next number after 2), and the condition `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` must still hold true.
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False**
