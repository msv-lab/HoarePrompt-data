According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False, `j` is `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `i * i + i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False, `j` is `i * i + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
