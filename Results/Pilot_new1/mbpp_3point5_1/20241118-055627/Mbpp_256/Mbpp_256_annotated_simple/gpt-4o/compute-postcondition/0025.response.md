Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the element at index 3 in `is_prime` is False. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, the corresponding elements in `is_prime` are set to False. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
