According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is updated, `j` is the next valid value within the range `range(i * i, n, i)`. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to the next valid value within the range `range(i * i, n, i)` after the last iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is updated, `j` is the next valid value within the range `range(i * i, n, i)`**
