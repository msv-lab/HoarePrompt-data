According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`, which means `j` needs to be less than `n - i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - i`, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to True, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are set to False, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is False**
