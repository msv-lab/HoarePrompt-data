According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after the previous value, and `num` is not divisible by the new `i` value. To execute one more time, the next `i` value should be considered, which means incrementing the current `i` value by 1. Additionally, since `num` is not divisible by the new `i` value, the new `i` value should be checked for divisibility with `num`. If it is divisible, then the loop will not execute again, so the `num` value needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after the previous value, `num` is not divisible by the new `i` value**.
