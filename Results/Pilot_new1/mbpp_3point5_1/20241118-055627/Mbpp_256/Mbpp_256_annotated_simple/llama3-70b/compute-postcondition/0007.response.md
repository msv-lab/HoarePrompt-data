According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num` and `num` is not divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the previous value, and `num` should not be divisible by the new `i` value.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after the previous value, `num` is not divisible by the new `i` value**
