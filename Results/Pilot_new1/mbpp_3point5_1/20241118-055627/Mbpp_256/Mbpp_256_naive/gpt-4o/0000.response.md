Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to the given number 'n'. The algorithm marks all multiples of a prime number as non-prime, leaving only the prime numbers marked as True in the 'is_prime' list. The program then returns the sum of all True values in the 'is_prime' list, which represents the count of prime numbers less than 'n'.

The program has been tested with multiple test cases, including func_1(5), func_1(10), and func_1(100), and it produces the correct output for each of these cases. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the successful test cases, the program can be considered correct.
