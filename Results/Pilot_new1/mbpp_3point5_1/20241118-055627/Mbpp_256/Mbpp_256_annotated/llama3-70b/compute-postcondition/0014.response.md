Output State: **If num is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If num is greater than or equal to 4, the loop checks if num is divisible by i where i ranges from 2 to the square root of num rounded up. If num is divisible by any i, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables num and i.**
