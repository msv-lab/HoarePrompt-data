According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 3. The loop condition `range(i * i, n, i)` will determine the range of values for `j` based on `i`. So, for the loop to execute, `i * i` must be less than `n` and `i` should be a valid divisor of `n`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 3, `j` is `i * i` which is 9, `i` is a valid divisor of `n`**
