According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j < n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Since `j` is calculated as `i * i` initially, the next value of `j` will be `i * i + i`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is less than `n`**
