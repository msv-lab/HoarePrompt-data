According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 2, so in order for the loop to execute, `i * i` must be less than `n`. Additionally, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, which means that `is_prime[i]` must be True. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `i * i` is less than `n` and `is_prime[i]` is True.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to True, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is True**
