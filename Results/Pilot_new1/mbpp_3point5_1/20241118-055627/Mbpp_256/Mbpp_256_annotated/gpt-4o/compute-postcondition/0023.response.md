According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `is_prime[j]` is False, `j` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` and `j` should be updated to the next value after 9, which is 12 in this case.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[j]` is False, `j` is less than `n`**
