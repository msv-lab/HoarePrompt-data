According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `j` is incremented by `i`, it means `j` will be `i * i` in the next iteration. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` in the next iteration. 
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `is_prime[j]` is False, `j` is less than `n`**
