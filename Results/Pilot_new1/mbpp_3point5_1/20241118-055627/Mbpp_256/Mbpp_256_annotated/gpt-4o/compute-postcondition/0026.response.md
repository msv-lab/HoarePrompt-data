According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 3. For any value of `j` where `i * i <= j < n` and `j` is a multiple of `i`, `is_prime[j]` is False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 4**
