According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is less than `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop is iterating over `j` starting from `i * i`, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by `i`.
- The value of `j` needs to be less than `n`, so `j` should be less than `n`.
- Since `is_prime[j]` is False, it should be True for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is True**
