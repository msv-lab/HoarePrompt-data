According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 4, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[16]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated value of `j`. Since `j` needs to be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration needs to be adjusted. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 4, `j` is less than `n` and `is_prime[16]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated value of `j + i`.**
