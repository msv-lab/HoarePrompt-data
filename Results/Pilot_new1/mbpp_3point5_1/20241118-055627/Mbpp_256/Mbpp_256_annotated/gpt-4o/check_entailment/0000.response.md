Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The code first handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0, as expected. Then, it generates a list `is_prime` of boolean values where `True` indicates a prime number. The code marks multiples of each number as `False` in the `is_prime` list, effectively sieving out non-prime numbers. Finally, it calculates the sum of the boolean values in the `is_prime` list and returns the result, which corresponds to the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

The annotations provided give a clear explanation of the logic behind the code, detailing the behavior of the program for different scenarios. The annotations help in understanding how the code identifies prime numbers and how it handles cases where `n` is less than 2. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations provide additional clarity on the implementation details.
