Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program defines a function that correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to the given number. The program has been tested with multiple test cases such as func_1(5), func_1(10), and func_1(100), and it produces the expected results for all these cases. Additionally, the program handles the edge case of n <= 2 by returning 0, which is also in line with the problem description. Therefore, based on the provided code and test cases, the program is correct in calculating the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number.
