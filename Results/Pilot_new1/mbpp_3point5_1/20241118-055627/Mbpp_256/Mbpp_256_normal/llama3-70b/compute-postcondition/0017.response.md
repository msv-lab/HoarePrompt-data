Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer num and returns True if num is a prime number, and False otherwise. It first checks if num is less than 2 and returns False in that case. Then, it iterates through numbers from 2 up to the square root of num to check for divisibility. If num is divisible by any number in this range, it returns False. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it returns True.**
