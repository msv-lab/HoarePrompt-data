According to the code, the loop can execute if `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `num` is a non-negative integer, so it already meets the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state for the loop to execute.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2**
