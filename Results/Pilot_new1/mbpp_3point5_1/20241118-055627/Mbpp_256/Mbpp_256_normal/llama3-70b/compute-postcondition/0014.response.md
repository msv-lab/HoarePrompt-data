Output State: **If num is less than 2, the loop does not execute and there are no changes to the variables. If num is greater than or equal to 2, the loop checks divisibility of num by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of num. If num is divisible by any i, the function returns False. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables num and i.**
