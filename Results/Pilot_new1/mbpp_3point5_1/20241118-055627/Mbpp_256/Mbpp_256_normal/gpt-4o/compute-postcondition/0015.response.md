Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True. If `is_prime[i]`, then for each multiple of `i` within the range of `i * i` to `n` (exclusive), the corresponding index in `is_prime` is set to False. The loop will not execute if `i * i >= n`, maintaining the initial state of the variables.***
