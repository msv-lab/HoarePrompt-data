Example Answer:
`is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to False. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False**
