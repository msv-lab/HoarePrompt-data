According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i * i < n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must satisfy the condition `i * i < n` and `i` must be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be the next integer after the current `i`.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next integer after the current `i`**
