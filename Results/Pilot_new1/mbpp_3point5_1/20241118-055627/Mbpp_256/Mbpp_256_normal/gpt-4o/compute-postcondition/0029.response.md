According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range `range(i * i, n, i)` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, and the value at index `j` in `is_prime` is set to False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. The value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. The value at index `j` in `is_prime` needs to be set to True.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, and the value at index `j` in `is_prime` is set to True**
