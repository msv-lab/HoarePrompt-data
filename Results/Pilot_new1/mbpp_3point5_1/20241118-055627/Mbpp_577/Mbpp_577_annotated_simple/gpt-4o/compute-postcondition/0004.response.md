Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer. If n is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If n is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of n, where factorial is initialized to 1, and updates it by multiplying it with each integer from 1 to n. Finally, the function returns the last digit of the calculated factorial.***
