The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If n is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, for n less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial. The variable `factorial` is initialized to 1 for n less than 5. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if n is greater than or equal to 5. If n is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial.
