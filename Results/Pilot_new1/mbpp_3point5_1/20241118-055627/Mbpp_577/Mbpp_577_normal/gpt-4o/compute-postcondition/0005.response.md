The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial as the result. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if n is greater than or equal to 5, or return the last digit of the factorial of n if n is less than 5.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n >= 5, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial.**
