The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list that contains all elements of list `lst` followed by all elements of tuple `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that combines all elements from `lst` and `tpl`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that contains all elements of `lst` followed by all elements of `tpl`.**
