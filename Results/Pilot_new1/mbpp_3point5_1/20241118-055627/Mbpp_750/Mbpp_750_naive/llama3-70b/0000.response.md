Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns a new list that contains all the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tup`. The provided program achieves this by converting the tuple `tup` into a list using the `list()` function and then concatenating it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and works for all potential cases.
