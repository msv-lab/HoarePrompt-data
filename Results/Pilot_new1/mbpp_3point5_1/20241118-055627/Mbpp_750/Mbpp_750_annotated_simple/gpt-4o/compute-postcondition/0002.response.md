Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then concatenates `lst` with the elements of `tpl` after converting the elements of `tpl` to a list. **

The code does exactly what the annotations state, it concatenates the list `lst` with the elements of tuple `tpl` after converting the tuple elements to a list. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases to consider in this scenario.
