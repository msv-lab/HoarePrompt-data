Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates it with the input list `lst`. This implementation meets the requirements of the problem description as it adds the elements of the tuple to the list, as specified. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
