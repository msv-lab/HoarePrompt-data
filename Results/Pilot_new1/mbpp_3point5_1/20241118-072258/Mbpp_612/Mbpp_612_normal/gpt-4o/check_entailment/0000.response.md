Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. The function then extracts the first elements of each sublist and the second elements of each sublist into two separate lists, and finally returns a list containing these two extracted lists. The code is correctly implemented as per the problem description. 

The code has been tested with multiple test cases, including lists containing strings, integers, and lists as elements, and it correctly returns the expected output for all cases. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the code is true.
