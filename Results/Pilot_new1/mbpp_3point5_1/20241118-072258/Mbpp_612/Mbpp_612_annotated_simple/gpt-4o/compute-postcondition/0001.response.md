Example Answer:
The code creates a new list `second_elements` by extracting the second element from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains sublists with exactly two elements, the `second_elements` list will contain all the second elements. Therefore, the output state is: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists; second_elements is a list containing all the second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists; second_elements is a list containing all the second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists**
