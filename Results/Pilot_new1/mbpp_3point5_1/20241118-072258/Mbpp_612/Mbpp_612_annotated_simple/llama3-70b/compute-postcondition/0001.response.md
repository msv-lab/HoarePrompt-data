After executing the function body, the program returns two lists: the first list contains the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements, and return two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist.
