Example Answer:
The code creates a new list `second_elements` by extracting the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` contains sublists with exactly two elements, the code will successfully extract the second element from each sublist. Therefore, the Output State is: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of the sublists; second_elements is a list containing all the second elements of the sublists.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of the sublists; second_elements is a list containing all the second elements of the sublists**
