Example Answer:
The code extracts the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists and assigns it to the variable first_elements. Since each sublist contains exactly two elements, the first_elements list will contain all the first elements of the sublists. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of the sublists.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing all the first elements of the sublists**
