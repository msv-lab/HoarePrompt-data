Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second. The implementation uses list comprehensions to achieve this, which is a concise and efficient way to manipulate lists in Python. The function is handling each sublist correctly and returning the desired output. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the program is not handling. Therefore, the program is correct.
