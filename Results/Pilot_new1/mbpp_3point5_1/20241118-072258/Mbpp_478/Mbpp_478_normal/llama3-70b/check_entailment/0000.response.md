Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the input string `s`. The code uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate through each character in the input string and includes only the uppercase letters in the output string. This logic aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string. 

Since the code accurately implements the desired functionality and the output hints also confirm that the function correctly filters out lowercase letters and retains only uppercase letters, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
