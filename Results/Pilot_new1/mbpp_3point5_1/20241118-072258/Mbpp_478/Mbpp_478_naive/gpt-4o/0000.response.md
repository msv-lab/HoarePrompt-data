Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description. The program is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it actually only keeps the uppercase characters and removes the lowercase characters. This means that if the input string contains any uppercase characters, they will also be removed, which is not what the problem description specifies. 

For example, if we pass the input 'PyThon' to the function, the expected output should be 'PT', as the lowercase substring 'y' should be removed. However, the actual output of the program will be 'PT', which is incorrect as it also removes the uppercase character 'T'.
