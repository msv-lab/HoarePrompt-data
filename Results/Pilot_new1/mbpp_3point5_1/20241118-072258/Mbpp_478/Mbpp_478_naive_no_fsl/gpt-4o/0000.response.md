Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description. The function `func_1` is only removing lowercase letters, but it should be removing entire lowercase substrings. For example, for the input 'PYTHon', the expected output should be 'PYTH', but the program is returning 'PYTHo'. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle removing entire lowercase substrings.
