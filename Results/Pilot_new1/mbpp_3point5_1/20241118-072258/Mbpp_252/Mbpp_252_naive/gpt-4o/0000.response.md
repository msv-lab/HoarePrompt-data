Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is supposed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates, but it is only accepting integers as input. The `cmath.polar()` function expects a complex number as input, so passing integers will result in a TypeError. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
