Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns its absolute value and phase, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the program returns the absolute value and phase of the complex number `c`. Since there are no conflicting cases mentioned in the annotations and the code meets the requirements of the problem description, the code is considered correct.
