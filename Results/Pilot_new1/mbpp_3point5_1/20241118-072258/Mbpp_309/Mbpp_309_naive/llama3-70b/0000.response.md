Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program simply uses the built-in `max()` function in Python to find the maximum of two numbers. This is the correct and expected behavior as per the problem description. The `max()` function returns the largest of the input values, which is exactly what is required to find the maximum of two numbers. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this program would not work as expected.
