Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an `element`, and returns the number of occurrences of `element` within the tuple `tup`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples to accurately count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The code aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. Additionally, the provided test cases also validate that the function works as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
