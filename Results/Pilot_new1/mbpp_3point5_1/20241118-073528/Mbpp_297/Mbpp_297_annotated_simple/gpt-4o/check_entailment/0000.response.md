Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively calling itself on each nested list encountered and appending non-list elements to the flat list. The function handles nested structures of any depth and correctly returns a flattened list. The logic implemented in the function aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the program is correct.
