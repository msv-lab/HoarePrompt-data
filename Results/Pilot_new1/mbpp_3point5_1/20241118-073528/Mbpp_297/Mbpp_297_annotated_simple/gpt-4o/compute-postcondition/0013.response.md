Example Answer:
`item` is appended to `flat_list`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, but `flat_list` is a list structure with at least 3 elements. After execution, `item` is added to `flat_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a nested list structure with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` has additional element(s) from `item`.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a nested list structure with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` has additional element(s) from `item`**
