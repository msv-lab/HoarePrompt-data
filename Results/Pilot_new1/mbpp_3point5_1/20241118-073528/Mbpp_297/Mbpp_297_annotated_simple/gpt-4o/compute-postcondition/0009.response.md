Example Answer: 
The `item` variable from the `nested_list` is appended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` now contains the `item` element. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(item) if the first element of nested_list is a list. If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only that element, and `item` is appended to `flat_list`.
Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(item) if the first element of nested_list is a list. If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only that element, and `item` is appended to `flat_list`**
