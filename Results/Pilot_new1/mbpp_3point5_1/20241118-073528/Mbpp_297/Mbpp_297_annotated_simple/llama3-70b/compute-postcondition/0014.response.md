Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list. After the execution of the if-else block, the state of the program variables is as follows: If element is a list, the elements returned by `func_1(element)` are added to flat_list. If element is not a list, element is appended to flat_list. All possible cases including nested lists are handled, ensuring that flat_list contains the appropriate elements based on the type of element in nested_list.***
