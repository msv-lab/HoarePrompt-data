Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens the nested_list and returns a flat_list containing all the elements from the nested structure. The function correctly handles cases where the elements are either lists or non-lists, ensuring that the flat_list is populated appropriately based on the type of elements present in the nested_list. If the nested_list is empty, the function returns an empty flat_list.**
