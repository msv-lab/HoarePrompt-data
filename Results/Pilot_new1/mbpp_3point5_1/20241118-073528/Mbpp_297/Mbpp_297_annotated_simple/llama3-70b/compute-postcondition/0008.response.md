Example Answer: 
The `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(element)`, where `element` is an element in the `nested_list`. If `element` is a list, `func_1(element)` returns elements that are then added to `flat_list`. If `element` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. The `nested_list` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list**
