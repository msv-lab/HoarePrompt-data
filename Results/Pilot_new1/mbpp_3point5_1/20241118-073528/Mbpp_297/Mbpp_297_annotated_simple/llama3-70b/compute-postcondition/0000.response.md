Example Answer: 
`flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. This initialization does not affect the state of `nested_list` if it contains nested lists. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is an empty list**
