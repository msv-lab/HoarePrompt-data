Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function successfully flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each element. It checks if the current element is a list, and if so, calls itself recursively on that list. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened into a single list. The function has been tested with multiple nested list inputs, and it correctly returns the flattened list in each case. Therefore, based on the provided examples and the logic of the function, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
