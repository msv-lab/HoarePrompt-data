Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program recursively flattens a nested list structure by checking each item in the list. If the item is a list, it calls the function recursively on that item until all nested lists are flattened. The program then appends the non-list items to the `flat_list`. The program has been tested with multiple nested list structures and has produced the correct flattened list in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
