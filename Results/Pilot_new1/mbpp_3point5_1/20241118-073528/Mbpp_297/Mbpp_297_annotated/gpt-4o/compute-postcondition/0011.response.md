According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more items left in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, and flat_list contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the next item in nested_list is a list, flat_list should be extended with the return value of func_1(next_item).
2. If the next item in nested_list is not a list, flat_list should be appended with the next_item.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration.**
