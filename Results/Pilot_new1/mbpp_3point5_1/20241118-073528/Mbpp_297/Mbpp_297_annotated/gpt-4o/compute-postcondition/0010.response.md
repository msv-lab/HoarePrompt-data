Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration. If item is a list, flat_list is extended with the return value of func_1(item). If item is not a list, flat_list is appended with item. The postcondition captures all possible scenarios of item being a list or not, ensuring that flat_list is updated accordingly with the elements of nested_list flattened.***
