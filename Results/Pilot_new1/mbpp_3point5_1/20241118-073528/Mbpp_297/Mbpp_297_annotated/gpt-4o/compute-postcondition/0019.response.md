Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens all nested lists within nested_list and returns flat_list, which contains all elements of nested_list flattened into a single list. The function handles cases where nested_list is empty, ensuring that flat_list remains empty in that scenario.**
