Example Answer: 
The element is the second element in nested_list, and flat_list appends this element. The nested_list remains unchanged, and flat_list now contains the appended element. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the second element in nested_list, flat_list contains the appended element.
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the second element in nested_list, flat_list contains the appended element**
