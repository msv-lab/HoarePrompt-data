Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list with at least one element, element is the first element in nested_list, flat_list is a list. If element is a list, flat_list is extended with the result of applying func_1 to element. If element is not a list, flat_list contains the appended element. The state of flat_list reflects the outcome of the if-else block, considering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
