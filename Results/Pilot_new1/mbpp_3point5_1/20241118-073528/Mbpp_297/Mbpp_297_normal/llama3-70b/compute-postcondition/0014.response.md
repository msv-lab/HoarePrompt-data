Postcondition: ***nested_list contains more elements. If the next element in nested_list is a list, then func_1 is applied to the element and the result is appended to flat_list. If the next element in nested_list is not a list, then the element is directly appended to flat_list. The flat_list is updated accordingly based on the type of the next element in nested_list, covering all possible cases and edge scenarios.***
