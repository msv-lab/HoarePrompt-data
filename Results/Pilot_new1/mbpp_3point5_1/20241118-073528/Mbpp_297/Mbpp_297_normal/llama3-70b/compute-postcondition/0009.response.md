Example Answer: 
The element is appended to the flat_list based on the type of the next element in the nested_list. The state of nested_list remains unchanged, and the flat_list is appropriately modified. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list contains more elements, flat_list is appropriately modified based on the type of the next element in nested_list.
Output State: **nested_list contains more elements, flat_list is appropriately modified based on the type of the next element in nested_list**
