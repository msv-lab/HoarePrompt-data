Example Answer:
The `func_1` function is called with the `element` as an argument, and the result is extended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` is updated based on the type of the `element` (whether it is a list or not). The previous values of the variables are not specified, so the output state is: nested_list contains more elements, the next element in nested_list is a list or not, flat_list is updated accordingly based on the type of the next element.
Output State: **nested_list contains more elements, the next element in nested_list is a list or not, flat_list is updated accordingly based on the type of the next element**
