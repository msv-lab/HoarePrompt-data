According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `nested_list`. If the next element in `nested_list` is a list, `func_1` is applied to the element and the result is appended to `flat_list`. If the next element is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the `nested_list` contains more elements. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If the next element is a list, `func_1` will be applied to it and the result will be appended to `flat_list`. If the next element is not a list, it will be directly appended to `flat_list`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **nested_list contains more elements, the next element in nested_list is a list or not, flat_list is updated accordingly based on the type of the next element**
