Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is a list that contains all elements of nested_list in a flattened structure. If nested_list is empty, flat_list remains empty. The loop iterates through each element of nested_list, if the element is a list, it applies func_1 to the element and appends the result to flat_list. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to flat_list. The loop ensures that all elements of nested_list are correctly added to flat_list, handling both list and non-list elements appropriately.**
