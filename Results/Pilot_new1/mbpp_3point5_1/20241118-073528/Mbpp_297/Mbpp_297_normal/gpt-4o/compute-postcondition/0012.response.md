Example Answer:
If `item` is a list, `func_1(item)` will return elements that are then extended to the `flat_list`. If `item` is not a list, `item` is simply appended to `flat_list`. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is updated based on the elements returned by `func_1(item)` or by directly appending `item`**
