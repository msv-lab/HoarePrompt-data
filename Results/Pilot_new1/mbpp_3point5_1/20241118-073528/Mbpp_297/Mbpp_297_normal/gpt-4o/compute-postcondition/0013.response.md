Example Answer:
The `item` is appended to `flat_list`. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. The states of `nested_list` and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is updated based on the type of `item`.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is updated based on the type of `item`**
