Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple one-liner that uses the `replace` method in Python to replace all spaces in the given string `s` with '%20'. This directly aligns with the problem description that asks for a function to replace all spaces in the string with '%20'. Since the code exactly follows the problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned where it might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct. The output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that the function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the same string with spaces replaced by '%20'.
