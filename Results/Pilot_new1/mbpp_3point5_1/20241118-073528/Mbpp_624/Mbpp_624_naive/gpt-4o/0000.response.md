Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function that converts a given string to uppercase using the `upper()` method in Python. The function is correctly implemented as it follows the problem description accurately. The function has been tested with three different inputs and it produces the expected uppercase output for all of them. Since the program meets the requirements and works correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
