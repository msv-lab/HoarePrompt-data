Example Answer: 
The `result_list` is sorted based on the index of the elements in the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. The sorting is done in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`, `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both, `result_list` is sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`.
Output State: **`list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`, `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`, `diff_elements` contains elements that are in either `set1` or `set2`, but not in both, `result_list` is sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`**
