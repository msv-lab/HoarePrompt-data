Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that takes two lists as input, converts them to sets, finds the symmetric difference between the sets, converts the result to a list, sorts the list based on the index of elements in the concatenated input lists, and finally returns the sorted list. This logic aligns with the problem description of getting the difference between two lists and sorting the result based on the index of elements in the input lists. The program handles all potential cases correctly and there are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
