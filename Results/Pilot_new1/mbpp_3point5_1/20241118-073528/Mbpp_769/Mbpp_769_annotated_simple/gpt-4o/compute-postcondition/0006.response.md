The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of elements in 'diff_elements' based on the index of elements in the concatenated 'list1' and 'list2'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of elements based on the index of elements in the concatenated lists.
Functionality: **The function accepts two list parameters, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements in 'diff_elements' based on the index of elements in the concatenated 'list1' and 'list2'.**
