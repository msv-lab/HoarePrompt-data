Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns the difference between the two lists. The code uses set operations to find the symmetric difference between the two lists, which essentially gives us the elements that are present in only one of the lists.

The code first converts both lists to sets using `set()`, then uses the `^` operator to find the symmetric difference, and finally converts the result back to a list using `sorted()`.

This implementation covers all potential cases where we need to find the difference between two lists. The code is concise and uses set operations efficiently to achieve the desired result. Since there are no edge cases or scenarios where the code may fail to provide the correct difference between the lists, the correctness of the code is **True**.
