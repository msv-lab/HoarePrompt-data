Example Answer:
`set2` is assigned the set created from `list2`. The values of `list1`, `list2`, and `set1` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`**
