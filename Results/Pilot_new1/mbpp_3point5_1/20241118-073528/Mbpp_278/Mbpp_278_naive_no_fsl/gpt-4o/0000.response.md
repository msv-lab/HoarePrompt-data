Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that iterates through the elements of the input tuple and counts the number of elements before a tuple element is encountered. The program then returns this count. The provided test cases cover various scenarios where the tuple contains tuple elements at different positions, and the function correctly counts the elements before the tuple element in each case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
