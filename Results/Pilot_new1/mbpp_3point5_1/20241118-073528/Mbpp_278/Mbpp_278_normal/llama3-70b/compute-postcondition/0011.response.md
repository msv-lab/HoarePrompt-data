Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples, `elem` is the first element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `elem` in `tup`. Otherwise, if `elem` is not a tuple, the function returns None. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the loop does not execute and the function returns None.**
