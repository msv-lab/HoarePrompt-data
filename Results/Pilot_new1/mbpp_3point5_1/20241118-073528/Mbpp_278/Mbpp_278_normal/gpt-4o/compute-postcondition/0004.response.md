Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing at least one element, `count` is 0, `elem` is the first element in the tuple. If the first element in the tuple `elem` is itself a tuple, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `tup`, `count`, and `elem`.***
