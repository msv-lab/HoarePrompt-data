According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the tuple contains at least 1 element and `elem` is set to the first element of the tuple.
State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple**
