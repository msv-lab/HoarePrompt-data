Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing elements, where at least one more element is present after `elem`, `elem` is the next element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables and no action is taken.***
