Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and loops through the elements. If a tuple is encountered, it returns the index of that tuple. If no tuple is found in the input tuple, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`. The code annotations also confirm this behavior by stating that the function either returns the index of the first tuple encountered or the length of the input tuple depending on the presence of tuples. Since the code and annotations align with the problem description and there are no cases identified where the code does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
