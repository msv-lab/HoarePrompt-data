According to the code, the loop can execute as long as num_rotations is a non-negative integer. The initial state before the loop starts is binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, and count is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0, and _ is in the range of num_rotations.
State: **binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0, _ is in the range of num_rotations**
