Example Answer:
The string `s` is repeated `(n // len(s) + 1)` times. Since `s` is a binary string, its length is either 1 or more. If the length of `s` is 1, then `s` is repeated `(n // 1 + 1) = n + 1` times. If the length of `s` is more than 1, then `s` is repeated at least `(n // len(s) + 1)` times. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times**
