Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that rotates a binary string a given number of times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value after each rotation. The logic of the program seems correct as it rotates the binary string correctly and checks if the integer value of the binary string after rotation is odd. 

The program has been tested with multiple test cases, and it passes all of them successfully:
1. `func_1('011001', 6)` correctly returns 3, as there are 3 odd numbers after rotating the binary string 6 times.
2. `func_1('11011', 5)` correctly returns 4, as there are 4 odd numbers after rotating the binary string 5 times.
3. `func_1('1010', 4)` correctly returns 2, as there are 2 odd numbers after rotating the binary string 4 times.

Since the program passes all the provided test cases and the logic seems to align with the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.
