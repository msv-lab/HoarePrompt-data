According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `integer_value` is the decimal value of the rotated binary string. If `integer_value` is an odd number, `count` is increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `num_rotations` should be greater than the current value and all other states should remain the same unless explicitly stated otherwise. 

State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0 or 1, `integer_value` is the decimal value of the rotated binary string. If `integer_value` is an odd number, `count` is increased by 1**.
