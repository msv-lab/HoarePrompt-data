Example Answer:
The `binary_str` is converted to an integer value using base 2. The value of `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, so the integer value represents the decimal value of the rotated binary string. The `num_rotations` and `count` variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, and `integer_value` is the decimal value of the rotated binary string.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `integer_value` is the decimal value of the rotated binary string**
