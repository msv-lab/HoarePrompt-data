Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` can be 0, 1, or 2. After execution, the new value of `count` will be one greater than the previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 1, 2, or 3, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 1, 2, or 3, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string**
