According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, and count is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `num_rotations` needs to be greater than 0, and `_` (underscore) can be considered as the loop variable. 
State: **`binary_str` is a binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
