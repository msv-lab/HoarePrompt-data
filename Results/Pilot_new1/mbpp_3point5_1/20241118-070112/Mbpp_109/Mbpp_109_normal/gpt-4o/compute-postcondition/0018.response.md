Output State: **`binary_str` is the final rotated binary string after `num_rotations`, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the decimal value of the rotated binary string is odd, `integer_value` is the decimal value of the final rotated binary string. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
