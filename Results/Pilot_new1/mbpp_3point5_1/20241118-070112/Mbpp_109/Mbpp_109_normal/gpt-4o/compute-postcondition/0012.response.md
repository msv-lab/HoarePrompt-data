According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the number of iterations is less than `num_rotations`. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num_rotations` needs to be greater than the current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than the current value, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2, `integer_value` is the new decimal value of the rotated binary string**
