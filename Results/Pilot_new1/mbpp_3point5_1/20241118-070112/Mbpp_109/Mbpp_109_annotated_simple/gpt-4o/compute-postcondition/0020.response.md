The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a binary string, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the final count of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after rotating it `num_rotations` times. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and return the count of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after rotating it `num_rotations` times.
