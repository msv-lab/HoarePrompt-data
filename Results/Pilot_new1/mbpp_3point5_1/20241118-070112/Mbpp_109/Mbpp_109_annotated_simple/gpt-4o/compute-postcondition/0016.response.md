Postcondition: ***Output State: binary_str is the updated rotated binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer greater than 0, count is either 2 or 1 based on whether the integer_value is odd or even, _ is 1, integer_value is the integer value of binary_str. If integer_value % 2 == 1, count is increased by 1, integer_value is assigned the integer value of binary_str, count is increased by 1 if integer_value % 2 == 1.***
