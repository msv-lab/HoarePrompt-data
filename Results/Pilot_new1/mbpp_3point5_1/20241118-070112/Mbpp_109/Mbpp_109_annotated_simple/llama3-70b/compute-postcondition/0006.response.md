Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, `count` is updated to the count of '1's in `temp` modulo 2, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `temp` is the first `len(s)` characters of `s`, `temp` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at index 1 + `len(s)`**
