Example Answer:
The code finds the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s` and assigns the index to `first_occ`. If `c` is found in `s`, `first_occ` will be the index of the first occurrence, otherwise, it will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: **s is a string, c is a character; first_occ is the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1 if not found**.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a character; first_occ is the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1 if not found**
