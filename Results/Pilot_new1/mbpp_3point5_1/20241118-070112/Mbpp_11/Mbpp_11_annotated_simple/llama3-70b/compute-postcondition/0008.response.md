Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes two parameters, a string `s` and a character `c`. It then finds the index of the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`. If both occurrences are found, it returns `s` with the characters at those positions removed. If either occurrence is not found, the function returns the original `s` unchanged. ** 

Potential Edge Cases/Missing Functionality:
- The function does not handle cases where the first and last occurrences of `c` are the same character, resulting in the removal of that single character. This could be considered as a missing functionality.
- If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string without any modifications, which is an edge case worth noting.
