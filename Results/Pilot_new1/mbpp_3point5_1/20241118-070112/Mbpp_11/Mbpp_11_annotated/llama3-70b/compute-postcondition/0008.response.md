Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It then finds the first and last occurrences of the character `c` in the string `s`. If both occurrences are found, it returns the string `s` with the characters at the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. If either the first or last occurrence is not found, it returns the original string `s`.**
