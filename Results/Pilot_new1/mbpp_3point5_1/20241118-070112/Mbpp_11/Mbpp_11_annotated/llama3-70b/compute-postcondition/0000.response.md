Example Answer:
`first_occ` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of character `c` in string `s` using the `find()` method. If `c` is not found in `s`, `first_occ` will be assigned the value -1. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, c is a character, first_occ is the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1 if c is not found.
Output State: **s is a string, c is a character, first_occ is the index of the first occurrence of c in s or -1 if c is not found**
