Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The problem description states that the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code provided does not handle the case where the first and last occurrences are the same index correctly. If the first and last occurrences are the same index, the code should remove that single occurrence, but the code currently returns the original string without any alterations.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem description, making the correctness **False**.
