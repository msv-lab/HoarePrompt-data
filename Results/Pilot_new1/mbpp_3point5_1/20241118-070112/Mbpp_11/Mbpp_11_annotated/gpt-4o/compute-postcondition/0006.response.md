The function `func_1` accepts parameters `s` and `ch`, where `s` is a string and `ch` is a character. The function also has variables `first_index` and `last_index`, which represent the index of the first and last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, respectively. 

In Case 1, if `ch` is not found in `s` (i.e., `first_index` is -1), or if the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` is not found (i.e., `last_index` is -1), or if `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns the original string `s` without altering any values.

In Case 2, if `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, the function returns the string `s` with the character at index `first_index` and `last_index` removed, if they are not the same index.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, find the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`, and remove the characters at those indices if they are not the same index. If `ch` is not found in `s`, or if `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns the original string `s` without any alterations.
