Example Answer:
`first_index` is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of character `ch` in string `s` using the `find()` method. If `ch` is found in `s`, `first_index` will be the index of the first occurrence. If `ch` is not found in `s`, `first_index` will be -1. Therefore, the Output State is: **s is a string, ch is a character; first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s**.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a character; first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found in s**
