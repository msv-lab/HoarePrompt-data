Example Answer:
The last_index variable is assigned the index of the last occurrence of the character ch in the string s using the rfind() method. The value of first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found, last_index is the index of the last occurrence of ch in s.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found, last_index is the index of the last occurrence of ch in s**
