The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers such that the length of `list1` is equal to the length of `list2`, and all elements in `list2` are non-zero. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of results after dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists of numbers, perform element-wise division between the elements of the lists, and return a new list containing the results of the division. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, performs element-wise division between the elements of the lists, and returns a new list containing the results of the division.**
