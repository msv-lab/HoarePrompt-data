Example Answer:
The code raises a ValueError with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Since the lists list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length, the condition for raising the ValueError is not met. Therefore, the lists remain the same.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length**
