Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length. It then returns a new list containing the result of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating that both lists must be of the same length. **
