The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers such that the length of `list1` is equal to the length of `list2`. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of results obtained by dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers, perform element-wise division, and return a list of the results.
