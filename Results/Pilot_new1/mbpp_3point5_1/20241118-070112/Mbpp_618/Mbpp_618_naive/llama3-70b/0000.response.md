Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if the two input lists have the same length, and if not, raises a ValueError. Then, it divides the elements of the two lists element-wise using a list comprehension and the zip function. This logic covers all potential cases as per the problem description. Since the program handles all cases correctly, it can be considered correct.
