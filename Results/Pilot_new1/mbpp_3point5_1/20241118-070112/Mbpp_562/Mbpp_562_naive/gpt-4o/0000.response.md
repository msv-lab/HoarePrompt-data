Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates through each sublist in the list_of_lists and compares the length of each sublist to the current maximum length. If the length of the sublist is greater than the current maximum length, it updates the maximum length. The program then returns the maximum length found. 

All the provided test cases pass successfully, indicating that the program is working as expected for different inputs. Therefore, based on the problem description and the successful test cases, we can conclude that the program is correct.
