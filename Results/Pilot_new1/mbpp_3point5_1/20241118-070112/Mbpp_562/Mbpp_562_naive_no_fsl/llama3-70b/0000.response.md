Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of sublists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The program achieves this by using a generator expression to calculate the length of each sublist in the input list and then finding the maximum length using the `max` function. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and will return the length of the longest sublist in the input list. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided where this program would fail to produce the correct output.
