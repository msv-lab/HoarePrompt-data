Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist. `sublist` is the next sublist in the list with its elements accessible. `max_length` is initialized to the length of `sublist`. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. The program ensures that `max_length` always holds the maximum length of any sublist encountered in `list_of_lists`.***
