Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the third sublist in the list, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains the same.***
