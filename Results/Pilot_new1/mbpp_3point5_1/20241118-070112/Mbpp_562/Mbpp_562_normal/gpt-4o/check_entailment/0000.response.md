Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and iterates through each sublist to find the length of the longest sublist. If the length of a sublist is greater than the current `max_length`, the `max_length` is updated. The function then returns the `max_length`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should find the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists. 

Additionally, the provided test cases also confirm that the code is correctly identifying the length of the longest sublists in each case. Thus, based on the code, problem description, and test cases, we can conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements.
