Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function that takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential cases as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
