Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It iterates through the array and checks if the element is equal to the current element in the array. If found, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the element is not found after iterating through the entire array, it returns False along with -1. The logic provided covers all potential cases, and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
