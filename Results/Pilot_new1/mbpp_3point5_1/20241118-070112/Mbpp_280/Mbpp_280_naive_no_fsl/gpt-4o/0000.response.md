Correctness: True

Explanation: The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value at that index. If the value matches the element, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with `False` and -1. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function correctly returns the expected output for each case. Hence, the program is correct.
