Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly iterates through all pairs of integers in the list and checks if their XOR results in an even number. The condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` accurately identifies pairs that XOR to an even number. The program then increments the count accordingly. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
