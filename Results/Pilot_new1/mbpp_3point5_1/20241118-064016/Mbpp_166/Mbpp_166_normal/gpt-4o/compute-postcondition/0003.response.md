Example Answer: 
`odd_pairs` is assigned the value of `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `odd_count` is already calculated based on the provided information. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the calculated value based on the provided information, and `odd_pairs` is calculated based on the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in the list, `odd_count` is the calculated value based on the provided information, `odd_pairs` is calculated based on the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`**
