Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1 or 2, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is equal to `i + 1. If the XOR of the elements at index `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number, then `count` is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all cases where the XOR operation between the elements at index `i` and `j` in `nums` results in an even number, leading to an increment of `count` by 1 or 2 depending on the initial value of `count`.***
