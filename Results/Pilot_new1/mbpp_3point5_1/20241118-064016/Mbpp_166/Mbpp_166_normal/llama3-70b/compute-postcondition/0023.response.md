Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is adjusted such that `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is adjusted such that `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`, `count` is incremented by 1**
