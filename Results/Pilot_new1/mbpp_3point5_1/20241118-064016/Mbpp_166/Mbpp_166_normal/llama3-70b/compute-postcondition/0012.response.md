According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` may have been increased based on XOR result, and `j` is less than the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` may have been increased based on XOR result, `j` is less than the length of `nums` incremented by 1**
