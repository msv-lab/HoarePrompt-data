According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `nums` has a length greater than 1. The loop index `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have a length greater than 1, `count` remains 0, `i` remains 0, and `j` is set to `i + 1`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
