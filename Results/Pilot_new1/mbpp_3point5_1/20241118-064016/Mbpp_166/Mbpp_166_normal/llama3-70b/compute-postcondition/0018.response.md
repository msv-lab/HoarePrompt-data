Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. For each pair of elements at index `i` and `j`, where `i` is at least 0, if the XOR result between the elements is even, `count` is incremented by 1. The XOR result between elements at index `i` and `j` is even and divisible by 2.***
