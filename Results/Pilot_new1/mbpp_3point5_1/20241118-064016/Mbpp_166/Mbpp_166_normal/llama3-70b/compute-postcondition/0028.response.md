According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and the length of `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, we know the loop can execute. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `j` starts from `i + 1` and goes up to the length of `nums`. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`**
