Example Answer: 
The value of `count` is increased by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` will have been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, XOR result between elements at index `i` and `j` is odd, `count` has been increased by 1.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, XOR result between elements at index `i` and `j` is odd, `count` has been increased by 1**
