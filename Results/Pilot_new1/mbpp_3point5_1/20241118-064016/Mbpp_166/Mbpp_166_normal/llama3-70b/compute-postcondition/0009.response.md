According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1. If the XOR result between elements at index `i` and `j` is odd, then `count` has been increased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` may have been increased based on XOR result, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
