Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a list of integers `nums` and calculates the total number of pairs in the list where the XOR operation between the pair results in an even number. The function iterates through all pairs of elements in the list and increments a count for each pair that meets the specified condition. If `nums` is empty or contains only one element, the function returns 0.**
