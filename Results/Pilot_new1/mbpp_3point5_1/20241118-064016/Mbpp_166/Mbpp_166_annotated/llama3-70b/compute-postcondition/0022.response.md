According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 2, `count` is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 3, `count` is an integer**
