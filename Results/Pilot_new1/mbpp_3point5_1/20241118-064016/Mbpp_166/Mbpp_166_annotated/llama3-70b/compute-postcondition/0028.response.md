According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` resulting in an even number does not guarantee the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`.
State: **If the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, then `count` is incremented by 1 for each pair that satisfies this condition, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1, `nums` has at least 2 elements**
