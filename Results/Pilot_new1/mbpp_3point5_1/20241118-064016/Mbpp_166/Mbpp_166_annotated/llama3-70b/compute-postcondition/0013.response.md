Output State: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the result of the XOR operation between the elements at indices `i` and `j` in `nums` is an even number, then `count` is increased by 1. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1 and `j` is equal to `i + 1. If the list contains only one element, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. If `nums` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.
