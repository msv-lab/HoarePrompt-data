According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1 for each such pair. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1 for each such pair. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 2**.
