According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop can execute another iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is an integer, and `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next index in the list for comparison with `j`. Additionally, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to ensure that it is always one index ahead of `i`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is an integer, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1**
