According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 3. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. Therefore, `j` needs to be updated to `i + 4` to satisfy the loop condition.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is updated based on XOR operation results, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 4**
