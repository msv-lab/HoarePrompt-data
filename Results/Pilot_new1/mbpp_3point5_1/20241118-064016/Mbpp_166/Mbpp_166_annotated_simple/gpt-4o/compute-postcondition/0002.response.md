Example Answer:
The variable `even_pairs` is calculated by multiplying the `even_count` with one less than `even_count` and then dividing the result by 2. The previous values of `even_count` are known, and the calculation results in the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 even numbers from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list, and `even_pairs` is the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 even numbers from the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list, and `even_pairs` is the number of pairs that can be formed by selecting 2 even numbers from the list**
