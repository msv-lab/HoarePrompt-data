According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` was increased if the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` resulted in an even number, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `j` is less than the length of `nums`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` may or may not have been increased, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1**
