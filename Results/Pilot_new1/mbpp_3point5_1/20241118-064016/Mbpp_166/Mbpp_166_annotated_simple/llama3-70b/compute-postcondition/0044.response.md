Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums`. It iterates through all pairs of elements in `nums` and increments the `count` if the XOR of the pair results in an even number. The final value of `count` is returned after the loop. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, `count` remains 0.**
