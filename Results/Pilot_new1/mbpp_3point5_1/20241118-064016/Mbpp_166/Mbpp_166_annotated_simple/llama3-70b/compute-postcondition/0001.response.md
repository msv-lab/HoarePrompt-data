According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the list `nums` has at least 1 element. Before the loop starts, `count` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, and `i` is 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
