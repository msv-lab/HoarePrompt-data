According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `nums` list. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element. If the loop is to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be updated to be less than the length of `nums` by incrementing it by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by incrementing it by 1**
