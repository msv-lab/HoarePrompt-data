Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by incrementing it by 1, `j` is set to `i + 1`, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, and the result of the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number**
