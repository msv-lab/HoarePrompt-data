According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and the list `nums`. Since `i` is less than the length of `nums` by incrementing it by 1, and `nums` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 
Before the loop starts, `count` remains unchanged, so it does not need to be adjusted. 
To ensure the loop can execute, `j` should be set to `i + 1` and `j` should be less than the length of `nums`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` remains unchanged, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by incrementing it by 1, `j` is set to `i + 1` and `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
