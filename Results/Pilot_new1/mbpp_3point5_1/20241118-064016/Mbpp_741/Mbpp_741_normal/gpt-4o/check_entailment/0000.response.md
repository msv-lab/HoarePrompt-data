Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
- Case 1: If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True. This is handled by the check `if not s`.
- Case 2: If `s` is a non-empty string and the first character of `s` is `first_char`, then the function loops through each character in `s` and checks if any character is not equal to `first_char`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False. This is correctly implemented in the code.
- Case 3: The function always returns True. This is handled by the final return statement in the code.

Therefore, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same or not, as described in the problem description. The code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
