According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s` and `char`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the loop will not execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the second character. So for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still be a non-empty string and `char` must be the third character. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the third character**
