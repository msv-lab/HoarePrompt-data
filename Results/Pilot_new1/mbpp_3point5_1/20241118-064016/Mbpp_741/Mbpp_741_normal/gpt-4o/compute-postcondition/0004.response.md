According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the string `s` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the string `s` must have at least one character. At the start of the loop, the state needs to be adjusted such that the string `s` is not empty, and the `char` is the first character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`**
