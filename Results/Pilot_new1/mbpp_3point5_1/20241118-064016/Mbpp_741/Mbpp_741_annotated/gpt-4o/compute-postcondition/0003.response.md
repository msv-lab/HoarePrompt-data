Example Answer:
The variable `first_char` is assigned the value of the first character of the string `s`. If `s` is an empty string, an error will occur as there is no first character. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, and if `s` is an empty string, the program returns True.
Output State: **`s` is a string, and if `s` is an empty string, the program returns True**
