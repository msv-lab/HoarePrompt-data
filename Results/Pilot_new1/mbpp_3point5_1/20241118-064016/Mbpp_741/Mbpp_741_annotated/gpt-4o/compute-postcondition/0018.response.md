Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True. If `s` is a non-empty string, the function iterates through each character in `s` checking if it is equal to the first character of `s`. If any character is not equal to the first character, the function returns False. If all characters are equal to the first character, the function continues to the end of `s` without any changes to the variables. If `s` is an empty string, the function returns True without entering the loop. The program also has a case where it returns True.**
