Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the input string are the same or not. It returns True if the string is empty, and False if any character in the string is different from the first character. The annotations also confirm that the program returns True for an empty string and False if any character is different from the first character. Since the code and annotations align with the problem description and cover all potential cases, the correctness of the code is true.
