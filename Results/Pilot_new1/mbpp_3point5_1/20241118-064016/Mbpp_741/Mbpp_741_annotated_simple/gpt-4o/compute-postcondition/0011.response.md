According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string. To execute the loop one more time, the next character `char` should be equal to the first character of the string `s`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with the next character `char` equal to the first character of `s`**
