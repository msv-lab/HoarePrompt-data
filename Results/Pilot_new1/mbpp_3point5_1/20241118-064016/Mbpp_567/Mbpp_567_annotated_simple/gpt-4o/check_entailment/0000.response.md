Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next one, it immediately returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, it returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. The function covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
