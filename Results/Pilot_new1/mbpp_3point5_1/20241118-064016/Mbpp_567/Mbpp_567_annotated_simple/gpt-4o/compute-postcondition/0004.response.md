According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` should be less than the length of the list minus 2. Therefore, the index `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of the list minus 2.
State: **`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, index `i` is less than the length of `lst` minus 2**
