Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by comparing each element with the next element in the list. If the current element is less than or equal to the next element, the function returns True, indicating that the list is in non-decreasing order. Otherwise, it returns False. The logic of the function aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
