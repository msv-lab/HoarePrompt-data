Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then the program returns False. In all other cases where the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`, the program does not return anything.***
