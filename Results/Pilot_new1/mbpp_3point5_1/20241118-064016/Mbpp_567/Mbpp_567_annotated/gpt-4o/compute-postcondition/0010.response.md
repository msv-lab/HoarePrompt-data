According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3**
