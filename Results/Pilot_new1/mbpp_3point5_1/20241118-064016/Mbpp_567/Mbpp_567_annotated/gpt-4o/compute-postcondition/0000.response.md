According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the length of the list will be 1 less than the original length. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 2 elements, and i is 0.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
