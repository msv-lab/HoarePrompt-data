The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The list must have at least 2 elements to avoid index out of bounds errors. 

In Case 1, the function checks if there exists an element at index `i` in `lst` that is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If such an element is found, the function returns False. Otherwise, if no such element is found, the loop completes without any changes to the state of the program variables.

In Case 2, the function simply returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. It checks for the presence of any element that violates the order in the list, and returns False if found. If no such element is found, it returns True.
