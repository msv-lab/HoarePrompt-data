Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. Ensure that the list `lst` has at least 2 elements to avoid index out of bounds errors.***
