The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. It iterates through the list and checks if there exists an element at index `i` that is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If such an element is found, the function returns False. If no such element is found, it returns True. Ensure that `lst` has at least 2 elements to avoid index out of bounds errors.
