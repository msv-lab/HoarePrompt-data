Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2. If any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1` at any point during the loop, the function returns False. Otherwise, the loop completes without altering `lst` or `i`. If the length of `lst` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute.**
