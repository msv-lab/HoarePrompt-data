Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a dictionary of student names with corresponding height and weight values, along with minimum height and weight values. It then filters out the students whose height and weight are above the minimum values. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Since the program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the description, the correctness is True.
