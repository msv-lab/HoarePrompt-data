The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student height and student weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with their corresponding height and weight values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter out students from the input dictionary based on their height and weight, returning only those who meet the specified minimum height and weight criteria along with their corresponding values.
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight is greater than or equal to the minimum weight, along with their corresponding height and weight values.**
