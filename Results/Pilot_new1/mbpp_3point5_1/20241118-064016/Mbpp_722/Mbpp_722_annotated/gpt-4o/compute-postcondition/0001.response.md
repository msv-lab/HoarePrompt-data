The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names, and values are tuples of two floats representing student height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with the format {name: (height, weight)}. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and return a filtered dictionary containing only the students who meet the height and weight criteria. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It returns a filtered dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight, with the format {name: (height, weight)}.**
