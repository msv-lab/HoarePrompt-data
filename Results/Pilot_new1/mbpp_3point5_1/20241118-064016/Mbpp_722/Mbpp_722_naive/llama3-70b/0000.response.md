Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly filters the student data based on the minimum height and weight provided. It iterates through the dictionary of student data and checks if both the height and weight of each student are above the minimum values. If both conditions are met, the student is included in the filtered result. The program logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
