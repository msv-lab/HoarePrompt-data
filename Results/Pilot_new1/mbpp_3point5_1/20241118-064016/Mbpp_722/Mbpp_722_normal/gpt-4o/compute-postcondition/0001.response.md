The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_dict` is a dictionary where each key is a student name (string) and each value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are non-negative floats. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with each key being the student name and the value being a tuple of height and weight. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter out students from the input dictionary based on their height and weight, and return a new dictionary with the filtered students. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It returns a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
