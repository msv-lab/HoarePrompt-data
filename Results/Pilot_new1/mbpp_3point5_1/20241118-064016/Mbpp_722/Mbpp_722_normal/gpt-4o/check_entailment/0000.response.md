Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It then filters the students based on the criteria that their height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the students meeting these criteria, with each key being the student name and the value being a tuple of height and weight.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function filters out students based on their height and weight, and returns a dictionary with only the students who meet the specified criteria. The provided test cases also confirm that the code is functioning as expected for different input scenarios. Therefore, the code is correct.
