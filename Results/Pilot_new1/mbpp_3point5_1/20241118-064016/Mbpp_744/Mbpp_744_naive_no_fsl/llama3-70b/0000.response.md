Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `any` function to check if there is any `None` value in the given tuple. The expression `(x is None for x in tup)` generates a boolean value for each element in the tuple, checking if it is `None`. The `any` function then returns `True` if any of these boolean values is `True`, indicating the presence of a `None` value in the tuple. The function works as expected for all potential cases.
