Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately implements the problem description by checking if any element in the input tuple is None. The code does not handle cases where the tuple itself is None or if the input is not a tuple, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the program returns True if any element in the tuple is None, otherwise it returns False. Since there are no cases presented where the program does not work as expected, and the code aligns with the problem description and annotations, the correctness of the code is true.
