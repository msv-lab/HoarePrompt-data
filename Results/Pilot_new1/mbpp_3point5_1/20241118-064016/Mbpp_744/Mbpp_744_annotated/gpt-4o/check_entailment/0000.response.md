Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple as input and iterates through the tuple to check if any item is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, the function returns `True`. If no `None` value is found, the function returns `False`. The annotations also confirm that the function behaves as described in the problem description. Since the code and annotations align with the problem description and there are no cases identified where the program does not work correctly, the correctness is considered as True.
