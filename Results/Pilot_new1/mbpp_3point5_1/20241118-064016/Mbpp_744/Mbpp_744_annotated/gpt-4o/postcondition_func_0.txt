The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. It iterates through the tuple checking for the presence of None. If any item in `tup` is None, the function returns True and stops the iteration. If no item is None, the iteration finishes without modifying the state of `tup`. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the iteration does not execute. The function always returns False at the end.
