Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the given tuple and checks if any element is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it returns `True`, otherwise, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover both scenarios where the tuple contains `None` values and where it does not, and the function produces the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
