Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple 'tup' as a parameter and returns True if any element in the tuple 'tup' is None; otherwise, it returns False. The code uses the `any()` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is None. This logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the code might not be handling. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented to fulfill the requirements of the problem description.
