The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, where `tup` is a tuple. 

Case_1: If `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item and the first item is None, the function returns True. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of `tup` or item. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute and there are no changes to the initial state.

Case_2: The function returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return True if the tuple has at least 1 item and the first item is None. If the tuple is empty, it does not execute the loop and there are no changes. Otherwise, it returns False.
