Example Answer: 
`s` and `d` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. The values of `s` and `d` depend on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input**
