Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, `buses` contains at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`. The variable `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. The overall state after the if-else block is that `min_time` holds the minimum calculated time, and `ans` holds the corresponding index incremented by 1.***
