Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the calculation of `wait_time` based on the given conditions, ensuring the correct handling of edge cases and boundary values. After the execution of the if else block, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `wait_time` and the previous `min_wait_time`. `chosen_route` is updated to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum `wait_time` found.***
