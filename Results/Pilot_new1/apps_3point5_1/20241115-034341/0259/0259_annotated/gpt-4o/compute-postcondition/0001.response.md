Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. The variables `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1**
