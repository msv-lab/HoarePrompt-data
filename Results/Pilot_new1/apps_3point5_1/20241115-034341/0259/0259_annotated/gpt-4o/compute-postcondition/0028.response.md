Example Answer:
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the tuple at index `i` in the list `bus_routes`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `i` is less than `n`**
