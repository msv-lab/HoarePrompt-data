Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is determined by the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes` and `t` is a positive integer. The previous values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
