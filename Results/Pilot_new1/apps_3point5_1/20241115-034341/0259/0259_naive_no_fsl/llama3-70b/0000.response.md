Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly takes input, calculates the time for each bus route, and determines which bus route Serval will use based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program iterates through each bus route, calculates the time difference between Serval's arrival time and the first bus of each route, and keeps track of the minimum time difference to determine the bus route Serval will use. The output is the index of the bus route Serval will take, which is in line with the problem requirements. The program covers all possible cases and outputs the correct bus route for Serval.
