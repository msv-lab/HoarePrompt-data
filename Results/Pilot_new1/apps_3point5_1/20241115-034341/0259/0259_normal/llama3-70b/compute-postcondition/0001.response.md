Example Answer:
The list `buses` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is an empty list**
