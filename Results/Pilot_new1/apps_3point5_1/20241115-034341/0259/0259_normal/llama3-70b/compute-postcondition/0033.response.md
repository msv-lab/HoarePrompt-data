Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_time` will contain the minimum time value calculated during the iterations, `ans` will hold the index of the bus with the minimum time plus 1. The loop will execute at least once if `buses` has at least one element. If `buses` is empty, the loop won't execute and `min_time` will remain positive infinity, and `ans` will stay as -1.**
