Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`, where two integers are taken as input and assigned to `n` and `t`. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000**
