Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route `i`, and `wait_time` is 0 if (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
