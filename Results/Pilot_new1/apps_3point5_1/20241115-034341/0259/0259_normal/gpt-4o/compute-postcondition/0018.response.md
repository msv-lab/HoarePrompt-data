Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are now updated based on the bus route `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route `i`**
