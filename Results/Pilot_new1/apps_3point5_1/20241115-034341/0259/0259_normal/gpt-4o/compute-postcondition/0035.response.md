Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where the value of `i` is unknown. Since the initial state is `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
