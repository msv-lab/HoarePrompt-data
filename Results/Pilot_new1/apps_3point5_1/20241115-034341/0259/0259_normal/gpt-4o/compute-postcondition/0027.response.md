According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route. The values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.

State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `n`, `i` is increased by 1, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged**
