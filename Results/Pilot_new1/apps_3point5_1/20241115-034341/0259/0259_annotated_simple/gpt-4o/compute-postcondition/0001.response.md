Example Answer: 
`chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. The variable `min_wait_time` was initialized to positive infinity and is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.
Output State: **min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity, chosen_route is -1**
