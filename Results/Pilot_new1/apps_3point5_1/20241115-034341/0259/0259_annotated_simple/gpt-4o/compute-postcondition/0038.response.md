Output State: **After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will contain the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` will indicate the route with the minimum wait time, `n` will remain the same, `s_i` and `d_i` will be assigned values from each bus route, `wait_time` will be calculated based on the conditions provided, and `i` will be incremented in each iteration. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, leaving `min_wait_time` as positive infinity and `chosen_route` as -1.**
