Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least two tuples. If `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. `i` remains 1, `s` and `d` are positive integers from the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d`.***
