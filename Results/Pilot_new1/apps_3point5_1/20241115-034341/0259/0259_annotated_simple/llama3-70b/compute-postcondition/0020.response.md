Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, buses contains at least one tuple, min_time is updated to the value of time if time is less than min_time, ans is the index of the tuple in buses plus 1, i is 0, s and d are positive integers from the first tuple in buses, and time is the result of (t - s) % d. If time is less than min_time, min_time is updated to time, and ans is updated to i + 1.***
