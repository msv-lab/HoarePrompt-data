Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the input split. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1' and an additional tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1' and an additional tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers**
