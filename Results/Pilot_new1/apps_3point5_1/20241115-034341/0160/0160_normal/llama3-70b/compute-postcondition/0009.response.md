According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **A is a list of N integers, N is an integer, K is a non-negative integer, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor, and i is 4**
