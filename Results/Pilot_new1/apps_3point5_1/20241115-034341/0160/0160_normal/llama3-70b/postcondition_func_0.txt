The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `K` from input, followed by a list `A` of `N` integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of all elements in `A` and then finds the maximum divisor of `gcd` up to the square root of `gcd`. The function prints the maximum divisor as the output. If `N` is less than 2, the `gcd` remains the first element of `A`. The function does not explicitly return any value.
