Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is an integer such that x >= 1 and the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) has at least one element, divisors is a set containing all divisors found during the loop execution. If x is divisible by i, then divisors contains the newly added divisors i and x // i, i is incremented by 2. After the if statement executes, divisors will include all the divisors of x that were found during the loop execution.***
