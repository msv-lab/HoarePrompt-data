According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `i < int(math.sqrt(x))` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, and the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) has at least one element. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `int(math.sqrt(x))` and incremented by 2. Additionally, the set `divisors` should be updated to include any newly found divisors during the last iteration.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is an integer such that x >= 1, divisors is a set containing all divisors found during the loop execution, i is less than int(math.sqrt(x)) and incremented by 2, divisors includes all the divisors of x found during the loop execution**
