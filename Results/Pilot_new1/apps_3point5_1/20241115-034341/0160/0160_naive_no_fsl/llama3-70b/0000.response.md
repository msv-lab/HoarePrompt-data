Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
