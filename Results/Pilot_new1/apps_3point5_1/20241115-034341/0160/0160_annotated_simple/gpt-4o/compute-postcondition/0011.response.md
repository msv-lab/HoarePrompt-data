Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is currently 3, after execution, the set `divisors` will contain 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing 3, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer equal to 3.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing 3, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer equal to 3**
