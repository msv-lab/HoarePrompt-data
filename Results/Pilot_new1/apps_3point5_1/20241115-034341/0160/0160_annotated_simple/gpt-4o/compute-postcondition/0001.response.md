According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, divisors is an empty set. To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should be 1, as it starts from the range 1. 
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
