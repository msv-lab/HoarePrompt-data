According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are integers. If gcd % i == 0 and i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and gcd // i. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, `i. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer value greater than the current `i` at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i` are integers. If gcd % i == 0 and i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and gcd // i. In all other cases, there is no change in the values of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, `i. i` is incremented to the next integer value greater than the current `i`.**
