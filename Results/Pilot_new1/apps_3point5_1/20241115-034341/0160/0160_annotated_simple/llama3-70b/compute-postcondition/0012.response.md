According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. If `gcd` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, so it needs to be adjusted to `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, the loop variable `i` should start from 1 and go up to the square root of `gcd`. 
State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `i` goes up to int(math.sqrt(gcd))**
