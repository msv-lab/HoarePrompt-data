Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. The value of `i` ranges from 1 to the square root of `gcd` + 1. The value of `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the range of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and the range of i, gcd is an integer greater than or equal to 1, i is an integer that ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
