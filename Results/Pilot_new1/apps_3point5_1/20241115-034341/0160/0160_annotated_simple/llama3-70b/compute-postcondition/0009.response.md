According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **N is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 4**
