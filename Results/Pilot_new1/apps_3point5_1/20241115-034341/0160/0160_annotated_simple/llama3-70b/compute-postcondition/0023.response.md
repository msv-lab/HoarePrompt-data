Postcondition: ***max_divisor, gcd, and i are integers. If gcd % i == 0, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i, where gcd is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and i is an integer ranging from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1. This update occurs if i * i is not equal to gcd. Additionally, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i when i * i is not equal to gcd. The postcondition covers all cases where max_divisor is updated based on the conditions specified and maintains the initial values and relationships of gcd and i.***
