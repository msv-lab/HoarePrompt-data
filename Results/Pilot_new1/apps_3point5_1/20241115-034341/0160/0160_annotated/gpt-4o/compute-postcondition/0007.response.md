Example Answer:
The code adds the integer 2 to the set `divisors`. Since the set `divisors` initially contains 1, after executing the code, `divisors` will contain 1 and 2.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1 and 2, x is a positive integer, i is 2, math module is imported**
