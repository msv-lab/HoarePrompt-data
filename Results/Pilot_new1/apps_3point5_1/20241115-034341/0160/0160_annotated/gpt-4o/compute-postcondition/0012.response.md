Example Answer:
The value of x is divided by i, which is 3, and the result is added to the set divisors. The set divisors already contains 1 and 3, so after this operation, the set divisors will have additional divisors of x. The values of N, K, A_i, and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1, 3, and additional divisors of x, x is a positive integer, i is 3, math module is imported**
