According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, divisors is a set containing 1 and additional divisors of x, x is a positive integer, i is 2, math module is imported**
