The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is a list of integers. The constraints for `x` are as follows: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N. After executing the function body, the program returns the sorted divisors set of the input list `x` in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `x` with specified constraints, and returns the sorted divisors set of the input list in descending order.**
