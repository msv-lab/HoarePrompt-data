Example Answer:
The list A is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input to integers. The input is split by spaces, and the integers are stored in the list A. The initial state does not contain information about the input values, so the output state is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input**
