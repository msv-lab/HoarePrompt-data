Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `**` represents exponentiation. Since `k` can be any value between 0 and 8, `x` will be 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, ..., 10^8 depending on the value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, or 1000000000.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, or 1000000000**
