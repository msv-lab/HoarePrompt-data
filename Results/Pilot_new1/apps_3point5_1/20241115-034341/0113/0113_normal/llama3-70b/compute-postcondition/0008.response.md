Output State: **If n is divisible by x then the loop will not execute and n, k, and x will remain the same. If n is not divisible by x, the loop will execute until n is divisible by x. In this case, n will be a positive integer divisible by x, k will be an integer between 0 and 8, and x will be recalculated based on the new value of k.**
