According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `x`. If the remainder of `n` divided by `x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, and `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `x` needs to be adjusted based on the new value of `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is calculated based on the new value of `k`**
