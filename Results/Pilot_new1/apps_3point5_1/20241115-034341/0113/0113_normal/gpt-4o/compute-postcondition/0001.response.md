Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` with the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `multiplier` is dependent on the value of `k`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, without knowing the value of `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `multiplier` and subsequently the value of `x`. The output state is: `multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`multiplier` is calculated based on the value of `k`**
