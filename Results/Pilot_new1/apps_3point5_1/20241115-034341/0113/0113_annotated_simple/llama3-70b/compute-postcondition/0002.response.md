Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, after execution, `n` will be increased by 1. The value of `k` is not affected, and `x` is dependent on the value of `k`, which is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, and `x` is a value depending on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, and `x` is a value depending on the value of `k`**
