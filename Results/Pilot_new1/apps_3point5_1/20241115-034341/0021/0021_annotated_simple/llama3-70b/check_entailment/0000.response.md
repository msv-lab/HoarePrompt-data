Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap. It calculates the position of the minimum element (integer 1) and maximum element (integer n), then calculates the maximum and minimum possible distances between them after one swap. Finally, it prints the maximum distance achievable. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all given examples.
