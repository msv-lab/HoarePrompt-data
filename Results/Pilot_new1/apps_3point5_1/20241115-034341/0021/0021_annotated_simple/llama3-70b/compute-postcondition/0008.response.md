Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from input, followed by a list of integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the numbers 1 and `n` in the list, excluding the numbers themselves. It also calculates the minimum distance between these positions. Finally, it prints the maximum of the maximum distance and `n` minus 1 minus the minimum distance. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
