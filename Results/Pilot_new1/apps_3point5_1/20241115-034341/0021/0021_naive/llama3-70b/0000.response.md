Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) in the array. Then it calculates the maximum distance by considering the case where the elements are already at the opposite ends of the array, and the minimum distance by considering the case where the elements are closest together. Finally, it outputs the maximum of these two distances. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
