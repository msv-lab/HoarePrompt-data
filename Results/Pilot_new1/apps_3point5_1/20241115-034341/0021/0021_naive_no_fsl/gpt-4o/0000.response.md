Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculating the distances from the ends of the array. The program considers all possible cases by calculating the distances from the beginning and end of the array for both the minimum and maximum elements. Since the logic in the program covers all possible scenarios and correctly calculates the maximum distance, the program is correct.
