Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers.
- It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, considering the positions of other elements in between.
- The code handles cases where the input list does not contain 1 or `n` by calculating the maximum distance based on the positions of 1 and `n` in the list.
- The output is the maximum distance calculated, which aligns with the problem description of maximizing the distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap.
- The code also considers edge cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array and returns the correct output.
