Example Answer:
The absolute difference between 0 and max_pos is calculated and stored in dist1. The value of max_pos is the index of n in list a. Therefore, the output state is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n integers, min_pos is 0, max_pos is the index of n in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n integers, min_pos is 0, max_pos is the index of n in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos**
