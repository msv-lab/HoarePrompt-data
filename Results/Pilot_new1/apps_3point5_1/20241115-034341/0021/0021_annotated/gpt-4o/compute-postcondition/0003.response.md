Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is unknown as it is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. Therefore, `max_pos` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `min_pos` is 0. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n integers, min_pos is 0, max_pos is the index of n in list a**
