Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of element 1 is the minimum possible index. Therefore, `min_pos` is assigned the value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n integers, min_pos is 0**
