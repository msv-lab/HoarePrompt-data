Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `max_distance`, which is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The initial state provides the values for `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The output state will be the same as the initial state, but the value of `max_distance` will be calculated based on the provided values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`**
