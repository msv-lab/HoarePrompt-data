The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. The function does not return any value explicitly. 

Functionality: **The function operates under the precondition that n is an integer between 2 and 100, and the list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.**
