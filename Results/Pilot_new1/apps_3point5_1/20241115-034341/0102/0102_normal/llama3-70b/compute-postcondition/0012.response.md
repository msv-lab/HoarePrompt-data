Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer where 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers in the teens range, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens digits from 20 to 90. If 0 ≤ s < 10, the program prints the string from the `ones` list corresponding to the value of `s`. If 10 ≤ s < 20, the program prints the string from the `teens` list corresponding to the value of `s` - 10. If 20 ≤ s ≤ 99, the program prints the string representation of `s` based on the `tens` and `ones` lists. The code snippet handles all edge cases and correctly processes the boundary values of the input integer `s`.***
