The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. After executing the function body, the function returns the word representing the number at index 'n' in the list 'ones' if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the word representing the number 's' in the list 'ones'. For the range 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 excluding 11-19, if n is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing the tens place of n. If n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the word representing the tens place of n, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of n. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correct output based on the specified conditions in the program fragment.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns the word representing the number based on specified conditions and constraints.**
