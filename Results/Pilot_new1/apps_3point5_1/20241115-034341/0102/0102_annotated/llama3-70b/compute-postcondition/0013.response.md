The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input. The function returns a string based on the value of `s` as follows:
- If `s` is less than 10, the function returns "Single Digit".
- If `s` is between 10 and 99, the function returns "Double Digit".
- If `s` is exactly 0, the function returns "Zero".
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the category of the integer `s` and return the corresponding string. 
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns "Single Digit" if s is less than 10, "Double Digit" if s is between 10 and 99, and "Zero" if s is exactly 0.**
