Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for n, m, k, a, and b.
2. The program calculates the floor and block numbers for apartments a and b accurately based on the provided formulas.
3. The program correctly calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha by considering the block distance, floor distance, and elevator waiting time.
4. The if-else block covers all possible scenarios for comparing the floor numbers of apartments a and b, ensuring the correct calculation of the minimum floor time.
5. The final output of the program is the sum of the minimum block time and minimum floor time, which is the correct answer as per the problem description.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
