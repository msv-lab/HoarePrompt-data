Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers; `a`, `b` are integers; `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time` are calculated values based on the input and formulas provided. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the if-else block.***
