Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided; `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided; `b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided; `min_block_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
