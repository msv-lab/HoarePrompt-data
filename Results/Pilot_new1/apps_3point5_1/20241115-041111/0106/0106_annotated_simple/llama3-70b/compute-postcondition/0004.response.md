Example Answer:
`b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `b` is used in the calculation, and `m` is also a factor. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided; `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided; `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided**
