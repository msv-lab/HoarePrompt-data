Functionality: **The function reads input values for n, m, k, a, and b. It then calculates the floor and block numbers for a and b based on given formulas. After that, it computes the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors based on the differences in block and floor numbers. Finally, it prints the sum of the minimum block time and minimum floor time.**
