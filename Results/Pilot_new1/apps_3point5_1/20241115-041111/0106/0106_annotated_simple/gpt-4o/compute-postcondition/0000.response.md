Example Answer: 
The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is used to calculate `block`. Since the initial state values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, the output state will be dependent on those values.
Output State: **The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.**
