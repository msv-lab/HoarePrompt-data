The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 
`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k. 
The function returns the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` as `total_time`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the sum of specific time values as `total_time`.
