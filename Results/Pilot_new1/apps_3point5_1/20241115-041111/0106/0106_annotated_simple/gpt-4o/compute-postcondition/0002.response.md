Example Answer:
`floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `apartment`. The division operation is performed on `floor_within_block` by `k` and then 1 is added to the result. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `floor` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **`floor` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`**
