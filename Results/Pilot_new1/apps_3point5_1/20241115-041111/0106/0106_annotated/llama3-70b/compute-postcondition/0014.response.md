Functionality: **The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates the floor and block values for `a` and `b`, then determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors based on the given conditions. Finally, it prints the sum of the calculated minimum block time and minimum floor time.**
