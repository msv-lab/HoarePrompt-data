Functionality: ** The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment`. It calculates the 'block' and 'floor' values based on the input `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The function then returns the calculated 'block' and 'floor' values. The functionality does not handle any edge cases or missing logic as the code provided does not have any. **
