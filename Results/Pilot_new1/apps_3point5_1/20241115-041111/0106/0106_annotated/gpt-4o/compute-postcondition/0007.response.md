Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are updated based on the locations of `a` and `b`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is set to 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15.**
