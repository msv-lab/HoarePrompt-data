Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the string and determines the number of prefixes with the desired balance. It handles the case where there are an infinite number of prefixes by checking if the difference between the desired balance and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference between the count of 0s and 1s in the string. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
