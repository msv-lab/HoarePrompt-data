Correctness: **False**

The given program does not provide the correct output for all potential cases. It fails to handle the scenario where there can be an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. The program incorrectly outputs a non-zero value when there should be an infinite number of prefixes, as mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
