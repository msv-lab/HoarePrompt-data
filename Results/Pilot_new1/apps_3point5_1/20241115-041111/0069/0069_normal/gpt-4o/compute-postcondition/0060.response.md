Postcondition: *s is assigned the value of data[index + 2], index is increased by 3, balance is the result of counting '0's and '1's in s, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 where n is greater than or equal to 1. If n is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute and the prefix_balances remains a list of zeros. The cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in s is 0. x is not in prefix_balances*
