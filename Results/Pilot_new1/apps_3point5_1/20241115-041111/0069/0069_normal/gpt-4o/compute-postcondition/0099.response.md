Postcondition: ***s is assigned the value at index index + 3*n + 2 in the list data, index is increased by 3*n + 3, balance is calculated, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances is updated based on the formula prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) with the new values calculated for each index i, balance is equal to 0. If x is in prefix_balances, results list appends -1. If x is not in prefix_balances, results list appends 0. The overall state of the program after the if else block includes all possible scenarios where x is either present or absent in prefix_balances, ensuring that the results list is updated accordingly.***
