Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is the index provided. The value of `n` depends on the data at the given index. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` adjusted based on the formula for the next index, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` in `prefix_balances` reevaluated for appending to `results`, `count` updated based on conditions for each element in `prefix_balances`.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` adjusted based on the formula for the next index, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` in `prefix_balances` reevaluated for appending to `results`, `count` updated based on conditions for each element in `prefix_balances`**
