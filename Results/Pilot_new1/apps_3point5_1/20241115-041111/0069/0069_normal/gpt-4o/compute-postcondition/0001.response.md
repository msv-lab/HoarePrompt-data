Example Answer:
The `input()` function accepts input and `split()` function splits the input based on whitespace and stores the individual parts in a list called `data`. Since the initial state is not specified, the output state after running this code is: `data` is a list containing the input values.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input values**
