According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 4, `n` is an integer value from the input data at index 1, `i` is 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`data` is a list containing the input values, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from the input data at index 1, `x` is an integer value from the input data at index 2, `s` is a value from `data` at index 5, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated based on the given formula.**
