**Precondition**: 
- $T$ is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - $n$ is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string $s$.
  - $x$ is an integer representing the desired balance.
  - $s$ is a binary string of length $n$ consisting of 0-s and 1-s.
- $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$.
- The total sum of $n$ for all test cases doesn't exceed $10^5$.
