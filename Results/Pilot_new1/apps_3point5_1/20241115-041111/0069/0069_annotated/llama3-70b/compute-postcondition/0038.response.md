Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, and calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`. It then calculates the balance as the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's. Depending on the balance and `x`, it prints different values following specific conditions. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If the condition ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0) is met, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). If `T` is 0 or a negative integer, the loop does not execute. The function does not have any return value.**
