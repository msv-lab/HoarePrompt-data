Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1, and the balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This covers all possible scenarios where the program correctly handles the division and printing logic based on the given input values.***
