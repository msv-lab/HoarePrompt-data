According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of the count subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
