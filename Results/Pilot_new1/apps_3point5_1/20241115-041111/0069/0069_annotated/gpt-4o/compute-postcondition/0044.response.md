Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the `data` list. The value of `index` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index` of the `data` list, and `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the `data` list.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value at index `index` of the `data` list, `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the `data` list**
