According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of the count subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition**
