Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, then after the loop executes, prefix_balances will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in s is '0' and -1 if it is '1'. If n is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute and prefix_balances will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1.***
