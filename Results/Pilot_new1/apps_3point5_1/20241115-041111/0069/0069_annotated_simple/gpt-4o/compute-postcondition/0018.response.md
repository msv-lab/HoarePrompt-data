According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `index` is 4, `n` is extracted from `data` at index position, `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4, as it should be less than or equal to `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index position, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index + 1 position, `s` is a string value extracted from `data` at index + 2 position, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[2]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `prefix_balances[3]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
