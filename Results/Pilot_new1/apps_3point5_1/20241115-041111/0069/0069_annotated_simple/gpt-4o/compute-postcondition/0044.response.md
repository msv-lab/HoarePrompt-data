Output State: If n is at least 1, the loop calculates the prefix sum of the balance changes in string s and stores them in prefix_balances. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with length 1. If balance is 0, and x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to results. If x is not in prefix_balances, 0 is appended to results. If balance is not 0, count is updated based on the conditions (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 for each b in prefix_balances, and the final count is appended to results. `n` is an integer value extracted from `data[index]`. `x` is assigned the integer value extracted from `data[index + 1]`.
