Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, balance is equal to 0, s is a string, prefix_balances is a list of integers storing the prefix sum of balance changes in s. The loop calculates the prefix sum of balance changes in s and stores them in prefix_balances. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with length 1. x is in prefix_balances.***
