Example Answer:
The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The value of `count` is already calculated based on the conditions mentioned earlier. If `prefix_balances` is empty or `balance` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the given conditions, `results` list contains the appended value of `count`.
Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` satisfying the conditions, `results` list contains the appended value of `count`**
