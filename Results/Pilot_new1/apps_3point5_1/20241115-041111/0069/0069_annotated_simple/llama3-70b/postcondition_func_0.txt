The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`, calculates the balance as the difference between the counts, and based on different conditions, it prints either `n + 1`, -1, or a calculated value. The function handles scenarios where the loop may not execute due to input constraints and provides appropriate output accordingly. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
