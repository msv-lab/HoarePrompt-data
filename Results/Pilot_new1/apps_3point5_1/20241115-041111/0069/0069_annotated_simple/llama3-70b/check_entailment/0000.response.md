Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string $s$, and the desired balance $x$.
2. It calculates the balance of the input string $s$ by counting the occurrences of '0' and '1'.
3. Based on the calculated balance, it correctly determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x.
4. It handles cases where there could be an infinite number of prefixes by checking if the difference between $x$ and balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1'.
5. The program outputs the correct number of prefixes or -1 if there is an infinite number of prefixes for each test case.
6. The program logic satisfies the problem description for all potential cases, making it correct.
