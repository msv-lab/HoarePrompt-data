Postcondition: ***T + 1, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance are assigned values from input().split() and the input string. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. The program handles all cases where the division is possible and prints the appropriate result.***
