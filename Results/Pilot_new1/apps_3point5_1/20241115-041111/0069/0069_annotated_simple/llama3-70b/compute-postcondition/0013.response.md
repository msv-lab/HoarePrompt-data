Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n`, `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1. The balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) equals 0, then the code prints -1. Otherwise, the code prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)***
