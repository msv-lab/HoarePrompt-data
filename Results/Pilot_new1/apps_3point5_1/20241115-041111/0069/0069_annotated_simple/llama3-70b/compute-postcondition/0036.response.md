Output State: **T is a positive integer. After each iteration, n and x are assigned values from the input. s is an input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, and balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) to handle all possible scenarios, including cases where the loop does not execute due to input constraints.**
