Example Answer:
The variable `balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s` and `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown, so the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1**
