Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the third element of list `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the third element of list `a`, and `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
