According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 1, it should be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer, `i` is less than `n` and incremented by 1**
