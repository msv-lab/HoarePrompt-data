Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence in ascending order and then iterates through the elements to check if each element is twice the previous element. If not, it increments the variable `m`. The final output is the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it outputs -1. The program handles all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
