Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the input sequence, sorts it, and then checks if the current element minus any previously assigned element is present in the set of assigned values. If not, it increments the count of variables required. This logic ensures that the program accurately calculates the minimum number of variables needed to perform the given operations. Additionally, the program handles the edge cases of input validation and set operations correctly.
