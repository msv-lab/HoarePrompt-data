The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and a list of n distinct positive integers a. It sorts the list a in ascending order, then iterates through the list to determine if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the list that are already assigned. If an element cannot be formed in this way, the counter m is incremented. The function returns the final value of m after the loop executes.
