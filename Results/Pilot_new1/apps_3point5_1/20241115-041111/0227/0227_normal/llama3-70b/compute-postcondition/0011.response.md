According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is increased by 1. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `i` is 3**
