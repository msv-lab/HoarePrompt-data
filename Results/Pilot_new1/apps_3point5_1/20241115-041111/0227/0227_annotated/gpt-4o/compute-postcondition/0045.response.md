Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and any element in `assigned` is also in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. 
Output State: **The element at index `i` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1.**
