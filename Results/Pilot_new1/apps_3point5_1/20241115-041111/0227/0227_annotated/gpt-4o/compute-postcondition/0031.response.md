Postcondition: ***`assigned` is not empty, `x` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is True and the loop is broken. This covers all scenarios where the conditions are met for the if statement.***
