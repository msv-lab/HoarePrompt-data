According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 1, `i` is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `assigned` list must have more elements to iterate over. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty and has more elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is a boolean**
