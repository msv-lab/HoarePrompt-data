Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It sorts the list of distinct positive integers, iterates through the elements, and checks if the difference between the current element and any previously assigned element exists in the set `assigned`. If not, it increments the variable `m`. The final value of `m` after the loop execution is returned, which represents the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations also accurately summarize the functionality of the code.
