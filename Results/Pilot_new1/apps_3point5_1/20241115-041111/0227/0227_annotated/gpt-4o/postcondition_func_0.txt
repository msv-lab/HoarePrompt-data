The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements, and checks if the difference between the current element and any previously assigned element exists in the set `assigned`. If not, it increments the variable `m`. The function then returns the final value of `m` after the loop execution.
