Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string of length n containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fractions of employees.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string of length n containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fractions of employees.**
