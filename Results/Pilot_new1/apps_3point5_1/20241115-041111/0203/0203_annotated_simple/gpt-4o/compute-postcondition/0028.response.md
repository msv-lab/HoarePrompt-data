Output State: If `d_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`, `r_queue` either has the new element `d_index + n` appended to it (if `d_index` is less than `r_index`) or contains the value of `r_index + n` (if `d_index` is not less than `r_index`). If `d_queue` is empty, an error occurs. `r_index` is assigned the popped element from `r_queue`.
