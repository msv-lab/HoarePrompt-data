Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `votes` containing 'D' or 'R' characters representing the fractions of employees. It then processes the votes by creating queues for Democrats and Republicans based on the character in the string. The function simulates a voting process by continuously comparing and updating the indices of the queues until one of the queues becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if the Democrat queue is not empty, and 'R' if it is empty. The function does not return any specific value.**
