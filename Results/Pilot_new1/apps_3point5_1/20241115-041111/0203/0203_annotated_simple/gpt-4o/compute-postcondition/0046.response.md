The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees and `votes` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fractions of employees. The function does not return any specific value, but it likely performs some computation or analysis based on the input parameters `n` and `votes`.
