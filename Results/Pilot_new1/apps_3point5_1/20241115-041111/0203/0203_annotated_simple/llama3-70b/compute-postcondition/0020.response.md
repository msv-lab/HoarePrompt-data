Postcondition: ***`depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers. The value of `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`. The loop has iterated through the fractions list incrementing `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the fraction values, and the final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are mutually exclusive based on the fraction values in the list.***
