Functionality: **The function takes an integer input `n` representing the number of fractions, and a list of fractions as input. It then counts the number of occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) in the list of fractions. Based on the comparison of the counts, it prints 'D' if the number of depublicans is greater than the number of remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not return any value.**
