According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. Since the loop iterates over fractions, the state needs to be adjusted to fractions is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, fraction is the first fraction in the list. Additionally, depublicans and remocrats do not affect the loop execution, so they can remain as 0.
State: **n is an input integer representing the fractions of employees, fractions is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, fraction is the first fraction in the list, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0**
