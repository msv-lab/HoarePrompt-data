Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The previous state of `r_queue` is unknown, and `i` was either added to `d_queue` or set to 0 based on the previous `v` value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `votes` has more elements, if the next `v` is 'D', `d_queue` contains 'D' as the first element and `i` is appended to it. If the next `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains `i` and `i` is 0. If the next `v` is the first character in `votes` and it is not 'D', `r_queue` contains `i` and the value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `votes` has more elements, if the next `v` is 'D', `d_queue` contains 'D' as the first element and `i` is appended to it. If the next `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains `i` and `i` is 0. If the next `v` is the first character in `votes` and it is not 'D', `r_queue` contains `i`.**
