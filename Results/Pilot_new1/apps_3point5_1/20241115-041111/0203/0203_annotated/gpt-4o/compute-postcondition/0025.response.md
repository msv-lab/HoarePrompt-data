Example Answer:
r_queue is appended with the value of r_index + n. The condition (d_index < r_index) is not provided, so we assume n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty. Therefore, the value appended to r_queue is r_index + n. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **r_queue contains the appended value r_index + n**
