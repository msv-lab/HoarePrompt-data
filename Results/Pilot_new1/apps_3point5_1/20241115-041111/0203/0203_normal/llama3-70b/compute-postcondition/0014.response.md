According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the characters left in the `fractions` string. If there are more characters left, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character. If the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1; otherwise, `remocrats` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, there must be more characters left in the string.

State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a string of length n with at least 2 characters remaining. If the first character of fractions is 'D', then depublicans is increased by 1. Otherwise, remocrats is incremented by 1.**
