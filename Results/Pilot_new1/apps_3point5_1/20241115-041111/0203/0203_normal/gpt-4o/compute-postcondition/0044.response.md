Output State: **If n is at least 1, after the loop finishes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters and their updated indices, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters and their updated indices. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty. Since the program did not enter the if block, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty.**
