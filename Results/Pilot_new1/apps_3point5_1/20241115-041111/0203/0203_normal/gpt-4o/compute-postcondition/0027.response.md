According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
- `d_queue` should not be empty
- `r_queue` should not be empty

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **If n is at least 1, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters and the index 'd_index + n', r_queue will be updated after either popping or appending the front element based on the condition (d_index < r_index or d_index >= r_index), and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. Additionally, if d_index < r_index, d_queue will have the new index appended, and if d_index >= r_index, r_queue will have the new index appended.**
