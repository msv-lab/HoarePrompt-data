Example Answer:
`d_queue` appends the index `i`, which indicates that a 'D' character was encountered in the `votes` string at position `i+1`. The previous state of `d_queue` is updated to include this new index. The states of `n`, `votes`, and `r_queue` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `d_queue` contains the updated list of indices where 'D' characters were encountered, `r_queue` is an empty list**
