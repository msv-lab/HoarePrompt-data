According to the code, the loop can execute again if both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to execute one more time are as follows:
- d_queue should not be empty
- r_queue should not be empty

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If n is at least 1, d_queue contains the indices of 'D' characters and the index 'd_index + n' along with the newly appended index 'd_index + n'. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. Additionally, if d_index < r_index, d_queue will have the new index appended, and if d_index >= r_index, r_queue will have the new index appended. r_queue will have the value of r_index + n appended.**
