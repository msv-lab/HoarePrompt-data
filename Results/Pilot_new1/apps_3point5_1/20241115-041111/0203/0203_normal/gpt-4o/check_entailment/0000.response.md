Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and the string `votes`.
- It then processes the votes according to the rules described in the problem description.
- The code creates separate queues for 'D' and 'R' characters and updates their indices based on the rules of the voting process.
- Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty after processing, otherwise it prints 'R'.
- The code handles the case where an employee denies another employee's right to vote and skips their turn.
- The code also correctly repeats the voting process until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining, as described in the problem description.
- The output of the code matches the expected output based on the given examples and the problem description.
