Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set**
