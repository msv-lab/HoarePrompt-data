Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i. If the value of `remainder` is already in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables and the program continues execution.***
