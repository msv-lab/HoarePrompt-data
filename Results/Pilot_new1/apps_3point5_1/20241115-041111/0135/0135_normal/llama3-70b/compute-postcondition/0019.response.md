Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated by adding the remainder of n divided by `k + 1`, `remainder` is the result of n modulo (k + 1). If the remainder of n divided by (k + 1) is already in the set `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits.***
