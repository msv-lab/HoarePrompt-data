Example Answer:
The remainder of `n` divided by `k + 1` is calculated and assigned to the variable `remainder`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and the value of `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `remainder` will be the result of `n` modulo (`k + 1`). 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated by adding the remainder of n divided by `k + 1`, `remainder` is the result of n modulo (k + 1)**
