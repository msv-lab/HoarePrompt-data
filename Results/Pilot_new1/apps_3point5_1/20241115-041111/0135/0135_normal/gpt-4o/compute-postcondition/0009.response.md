According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and k is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k). Therefore, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the last value of i in the range (1 to k)**
