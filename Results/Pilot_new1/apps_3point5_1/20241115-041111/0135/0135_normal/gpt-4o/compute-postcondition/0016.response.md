The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables n and k.

Case 2: `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1. If the remainder of n % i is already in the set seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables after the execution of the if else block. If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. If k is less than n, then `n` and `k` remain unchanged after the loop executes.

Case 3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers n and k within the range of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and return 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, return 'No' if the remainder of n % i is already in the set seen_remainders, and return 'Yes' otherwise.
