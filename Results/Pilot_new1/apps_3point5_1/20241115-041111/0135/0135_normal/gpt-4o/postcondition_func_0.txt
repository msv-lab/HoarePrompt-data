The function func_1 accepts two parameters n and k, both integers within the range of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. 
If the remainder of n % i is already in the set seen_remainders during the loop execution, the function returns 'No'. 
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.
