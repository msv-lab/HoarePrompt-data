Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers within the specified range of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No' as expected. 
If the remainder of n % i is already in the set `seen_remainders` during the loop execution, the function returns 'No', ensuring that all remainders are distinct. 
If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are indeed distinct. 
The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear understanding of the logic used in the function. Therefore, the code is correct.
