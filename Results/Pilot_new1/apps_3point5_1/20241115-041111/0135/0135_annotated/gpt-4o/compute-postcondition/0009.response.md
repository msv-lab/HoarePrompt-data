According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `seen_remainders` needs to be updated with the current `remainder`.
State: **`seen_remainders` is a set containing the current `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
