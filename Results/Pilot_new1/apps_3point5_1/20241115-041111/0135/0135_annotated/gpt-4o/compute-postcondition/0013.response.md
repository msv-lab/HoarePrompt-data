According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is a set containing the current `remainder`, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
