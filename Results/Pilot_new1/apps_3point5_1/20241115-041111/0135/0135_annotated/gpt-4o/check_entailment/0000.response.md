Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. The code handles the edge case where k is greater than or equal to n by returning 'No' immediately. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to k, checking if the remainder of n divided by i is already in a set of seen remainders. If a repeated remainder is found, the code returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, the code returns 'Yes'. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code's logic and how it covers different scenarios, which aligns with the problem description. Since the code covers all potential cases and the examples provided in the problem description, the correctness of the code is true.
