Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `i` are integers based on user input, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i` and is not in `seen`, `remainder` is calculated as `n % i`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits.***
