Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `i+1` are integers based on user input, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n % (i+1)` and is not in `seen`, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`. If the value of `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. The variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
