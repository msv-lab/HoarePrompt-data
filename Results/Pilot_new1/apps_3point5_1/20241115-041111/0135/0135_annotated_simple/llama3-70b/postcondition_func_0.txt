The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then iterates from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each number in this range. If a remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the `seen` set. After the loop, if no duplicate remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on the input values of `n` and `k`.
