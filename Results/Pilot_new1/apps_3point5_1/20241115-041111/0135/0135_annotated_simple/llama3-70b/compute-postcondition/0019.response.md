Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by 2, `remainder` is assigned the value of n % i. If the value of `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits.***
