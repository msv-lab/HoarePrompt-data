Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The initial value of `n` is unknown, and the initial value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, i is 1, remainder is the remainder of n divided by 1.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, i is 1, remainder is 0**
