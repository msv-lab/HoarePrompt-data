According to the code, the loop can execute if and only if k is less than n. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted such that k is less than n. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to k, the loop will execute with i starting at 1.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, i is 1**
