Example Answer:
The set `seen_remainders` is initialized as an empty set. Since this code snippet does not involve any calculations or changes to existing variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.**
