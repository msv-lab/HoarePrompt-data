Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It checks whether all remainders of division of a number n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. The program uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns "No" if a remainder is repeated, otherwise it returns "Yes". The logic of the program is sound and it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations provided also accurately describe the program logic.
