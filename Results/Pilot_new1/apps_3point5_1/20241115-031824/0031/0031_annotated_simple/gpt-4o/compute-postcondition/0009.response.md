Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The previous values of the variables are: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. After the calculation, the new value of `numerator` will be the result of the multiplication. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated value, denominator is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
