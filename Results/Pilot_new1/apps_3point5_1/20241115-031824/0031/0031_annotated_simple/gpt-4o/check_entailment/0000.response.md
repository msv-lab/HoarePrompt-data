Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It handles the case where k is greater than the total number of days in a year by printing 1 1.
2. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are well-defined and used appropriately to calculate the irreducible fraction A/B.
3. The program correctly calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability calculation, applies the modulo operation as required, and prints the final result after reducing the fraction to its irreducible form.
