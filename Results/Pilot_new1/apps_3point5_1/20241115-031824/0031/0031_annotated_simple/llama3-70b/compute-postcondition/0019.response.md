Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both being integers within specific ranges. It calculates the remainder of the product of decreasing values in the numerator and the total_days in the denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). The function then returns these remainders. However, the annotation mentions the use of `math.gcd` which is not imported in the code, so the functionality may not be accurately reflected. **
