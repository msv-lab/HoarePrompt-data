Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `total_days` remains as 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the product of all (`total_days` - `i`) values for each iteration, `denominator` is the product of all `total_days` values for each iteration. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 1.**
