According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of `n`, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the new value of total_days, `i` is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the new value of total_days, i is 3**
