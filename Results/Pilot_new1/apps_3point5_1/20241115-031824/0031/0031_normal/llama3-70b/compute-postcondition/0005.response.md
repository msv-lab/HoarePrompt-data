Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, which is calculated based on the value of `n`. The value of `numerator` is not affected, and `denominator` is updated to the new value. The value of `i` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 0.
Output State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is unchanged, denominator is updated based on the calculation, i is 0**
