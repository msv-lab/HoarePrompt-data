The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function returns the value of k shifted left by n if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state. The value MOD is 1000003. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it returns k shifted left by n. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state.
