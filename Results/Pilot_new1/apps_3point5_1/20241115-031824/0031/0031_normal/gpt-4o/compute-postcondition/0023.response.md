Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator. The value of `A` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
