Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, where `n` is unknown. If `k` is greater than `1` shifted left by `n`, then the program returns `k` shifted left by `n`. Otherwise, there is no change to the program state. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003**
