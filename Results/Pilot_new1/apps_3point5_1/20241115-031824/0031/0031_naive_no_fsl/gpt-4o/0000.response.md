Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^n days long year as described in the problem.
2. It handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by outputting 1 1, which is correct according to the problem description.
3. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the result modulo 10^6 + 3, as required.
4. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to calculate the greatest common divisor and the probability values respectively.
5. The input is correctly read and processed, and the output is formatted as required.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
