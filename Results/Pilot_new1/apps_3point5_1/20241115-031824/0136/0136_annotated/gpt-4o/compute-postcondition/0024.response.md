Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros. If `a` is 0, `a` is set to '0'. If `b` is empty or evaluates to false, `b` is set to '0'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is 0 and `b` is 0, the program prints '='.***
