Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros. The initial state of `b` is a non-negative integer, and after executing the code, `b` will be the same non-negative integer without leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros**
