Functionality: **The function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input represented as strings, compares them, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. The function handles cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros.**
