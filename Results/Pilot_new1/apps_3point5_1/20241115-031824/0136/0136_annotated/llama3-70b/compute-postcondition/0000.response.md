Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the input value after removing any leading zeros. If the input value is '000123', then `a` will be '123'. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits**
