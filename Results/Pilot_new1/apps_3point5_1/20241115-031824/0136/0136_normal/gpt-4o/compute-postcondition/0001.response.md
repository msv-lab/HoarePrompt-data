Example Answer:
The value of `a` is updated by removing any leading zeros from the string stored in `data[0]`. If `data[0]` is '00123', then after the execution, `a` will be '123'. The value of `b` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
