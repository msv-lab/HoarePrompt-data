Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the value of the second element of the `data` list after removing any leading zeros. Since `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` will have leading zeros removed if present. The state of variable `a` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed**
