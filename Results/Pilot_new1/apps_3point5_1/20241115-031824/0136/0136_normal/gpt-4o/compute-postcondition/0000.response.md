Example Answer:
The input is split into a list named `data`. The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The values of `a` and `b` are represented as strings. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
