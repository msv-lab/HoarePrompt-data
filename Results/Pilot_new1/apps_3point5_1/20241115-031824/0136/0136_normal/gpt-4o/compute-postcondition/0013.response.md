Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed. If `b` was initially an empty string, it is updated to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, where both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings.**
