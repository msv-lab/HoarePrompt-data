Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings and compares them. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '=', if `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<', and if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints '>'. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, the function lacks input validation for non-integer inputs or inputs with leading zeros, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior. **
