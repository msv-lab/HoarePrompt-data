Example Answer: 
The code removes leading zeros from the input string `a`. If `a` had leading zeros, they would be removed, but the value of `a` itself is not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
