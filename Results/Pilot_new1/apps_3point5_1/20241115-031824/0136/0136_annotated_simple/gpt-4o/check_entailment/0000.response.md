Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads two very long integers a and b, removes any leading zeros, and compares them as required by the problem description. It handles all edge cases where a and b can be empty strings or have different lengths, ensuring the correct output ("<", ">", "=") in every scenario. The program logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
