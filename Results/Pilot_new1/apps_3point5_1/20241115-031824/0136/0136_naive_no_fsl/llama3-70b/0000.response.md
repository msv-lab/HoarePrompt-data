Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes. Then it compares the two numbers and prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on the comparison. The program correctly handles the case where a is less than b, a is greater than b, or a is equal to b, as described in the problem statement. The logic seems to be correct for all potential cases, so the program is considered correct.
