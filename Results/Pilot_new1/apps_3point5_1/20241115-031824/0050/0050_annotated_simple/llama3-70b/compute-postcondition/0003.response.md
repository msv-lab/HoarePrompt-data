Example Answer:
The list `b` containing integers is sorted in ascending order by calling the `sort()` method. The order of the integers in the list `b` is changed to be in sorted order. Therefore, the Output State is: list `b` contains integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **list `b` contains integers sorted in ascending order**
