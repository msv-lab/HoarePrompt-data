Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, the specific values cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers indicating the price of shares to buy and sell, respectively, such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000.**.
