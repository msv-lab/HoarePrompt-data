Example Answer:
`max_shares` is calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. Since `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, the value of `max_shares` will be a positive integer. Other variables are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, and `max_shares` is a positive integer calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, and `max_shares` is a positive integer calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`**
