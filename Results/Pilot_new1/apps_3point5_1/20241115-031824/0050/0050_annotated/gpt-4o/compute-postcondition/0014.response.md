Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input, as well as two lists `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining amount of money after buying those shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares at the maximum price. The final output is printed as `total_bourles`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
