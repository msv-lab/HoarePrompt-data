According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged**
