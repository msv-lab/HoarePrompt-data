Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is greater than or equal to s[0] plus the product of `shares` and the first element of list `b` in descending order, `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated to include the product of shares and the first element of list `b` in descending order, and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is 0, the loop is exited. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program after the if else block.***
