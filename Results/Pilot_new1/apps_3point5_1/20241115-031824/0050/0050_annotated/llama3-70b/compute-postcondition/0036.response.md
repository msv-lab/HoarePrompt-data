Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is greater than or equal to s[0] plus the product of `shares` and the first element of list `b` in descending order, `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in list `b`, then `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop. This postcondition ensures that the program maintains the initial state and properly handles the cases where shares is either greater than 0 or not.***
