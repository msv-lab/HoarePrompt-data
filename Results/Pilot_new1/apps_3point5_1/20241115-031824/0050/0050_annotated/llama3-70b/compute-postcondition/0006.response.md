According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `shares` is 0, which does not impact the loop execution. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
