Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value in the list `b`. The maximum value in `b` is determined by converting the user-entered integers in list `s` to integers in list `b`. The minimum buy price `min_buy_price` is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list containing the integers entered by the user, `b` is a list containing the integers entered by the user after converting them to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list containing the integers entered by the user, `b` is a list containing the integers entered by the user after converting them to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`**
