Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the integer value obtained after dividing r by s[i] and adding it to the previous value of shares, `i` is 0. If r >= s[i], `shares` is updated by adding the result of r divided by s[i] to the previous value of shares, and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], the program breaks out of the loop without changing any variables.***
