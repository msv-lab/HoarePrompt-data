Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s_i`, `b_i`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is the integer value obtained after dividing r by s[i] and adding it to the previous value of shares, `i` is 2. If r >= s[i], `shares` is updated by adding r divided by s[i], and r is updated to the remainder of dividing r by s[i]. If r < s[i], the program breaks out of the loop. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
