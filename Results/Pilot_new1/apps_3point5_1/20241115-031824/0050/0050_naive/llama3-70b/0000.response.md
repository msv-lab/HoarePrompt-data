Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by first sorting the buy and sell prices in ascending and descending order respectively. It then iterates through the buy prices to buy as many shares as possible within the budget, and then iterates through the sell prices to sell all shares bought. The logic ensures that the maximum number of bourles is calculated correctly after the evening. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
