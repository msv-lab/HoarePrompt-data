The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, 'a' and 'b'. 'a' and 'b' are positive integers such that 1 <= 'a', 'b' <= 10^10. The program returns the final value of 'a' after the loop terminates. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers 'a' and 'b', and return the final value of 'a' after the loop terminates.
