Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b` and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The new values of `a` and `b` depend on the previous values of `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **The new values of `a` and `b` depend on the previous values of `a` and `b`**
