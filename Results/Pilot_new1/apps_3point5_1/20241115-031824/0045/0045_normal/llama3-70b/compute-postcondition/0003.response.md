According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` have new values where `b` is still truthy. Since `b` is still truthy, no adjustments need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`a` and `b` have new values where `b` is still truthy**
