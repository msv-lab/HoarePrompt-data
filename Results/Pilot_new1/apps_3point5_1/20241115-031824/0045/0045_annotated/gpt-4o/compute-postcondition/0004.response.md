Example Answer:
The value of `n` is divided by `min_sum` using integer division, and the result is assigned to `d`. The previous values of `n` and `min_sum` are not provided, so the output state is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. In all other cases, there is no change to the variables `min_sum` and `n`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. In all other cases, there is no change to the variables `min_sum` and `n`**
