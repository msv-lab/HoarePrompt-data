Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is generated by multiplying `d` with the consecutive integers from 1 to `k`. The value of `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. 
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`**
