According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is either -2 or a non-zero value, `i` is `k - 2`, and the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 3` to satisfy the condition `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is either -2 or a non-zero value, `i` is `k - 3` and the value at index `i` in the `sequence` list is incremented by 1**
