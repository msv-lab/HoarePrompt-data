According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition related to `remainder`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `remainder` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k` where the value at index `i` is incremented by 1, `remainder` is either -2 or a non-zero value, `i` is `k - 3`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `remainder` should be decremented by 1 if it is a non-zero value.
- `i` should be decremented by 1 to move to the next index.

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k` where the value at index `i` is incremented by 1, `remainder` is either -2 or a non-zero value (decremented by 1 if non-zero), `i` is `k - 4`.**
