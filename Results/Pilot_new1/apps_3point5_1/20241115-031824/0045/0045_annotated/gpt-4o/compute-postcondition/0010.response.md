Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is `0`, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. When `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This condition covers the case when the calculation of `remainder` results in 0.***
