According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. The loop is iterating in reverse order from `k - 1` down to 0. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `sequence` is a list of consecutive multiples of `d` from 1 to `k`, `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
