According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a value that is truthy. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is 1, `b` is a truthy value**
