Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.

The program calculates this by finding the absolute difference between x and y, then dividing it by 2 and adding the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic correctly determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. 

For all potential cases within the given constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000), the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output. Thus, the program is correct.
