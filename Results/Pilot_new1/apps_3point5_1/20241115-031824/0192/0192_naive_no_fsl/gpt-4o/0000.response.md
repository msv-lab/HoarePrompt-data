Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program takes the input values x and y, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. The calculation is done by taking the difference between x and y, dividing by 2, and adding the remainder of the division by 2.

The program follows the problem description accurately by ensuring that the length of each side remains an integer and the triangle remains non-degenerate throughout the process. Additionally, the program handles all potential cases within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
