Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` accurately represents the number of steps needed to reduce the side length from x to y while maintaining a non-degenerate triangle at each step. The code handles all potential cases as specified in the problem description, and the provided examples also match the expected output. The annotations also align with the code's functionality, further confirming its correctness.
