Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input numbers `x` and `y` and prints the result, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The annotations mention the correct steps that should be taken to transform the equilateral triangle of side length `x` to the equilateral triangle of side length `y`. However, the code does not implement these steps.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
