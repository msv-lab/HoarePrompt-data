Output State: **`Precondition`: a, b, c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer; `max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4; `total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4; the result of the calculation is printed.**
