Example Answer:
The character 'char' is concatenated to the 'res' variable. The 'res' variable contains all characters iterated over in 's'. After the execution of the code, the new character 'char' is added to 'res'. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's' and 'char' has been added to 'res'.
Output State: **'s' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's' and 'char' has been added to 'res'**
