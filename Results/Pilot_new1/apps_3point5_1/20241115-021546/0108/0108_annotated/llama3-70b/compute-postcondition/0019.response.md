Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'char' in 's' with the character that comes after 'char' in the alphabet. The variable 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'.
Output State: **'s' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'**
