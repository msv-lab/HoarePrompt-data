Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the `res` string. Since `char` is not defined in the initial state, the output state will be: 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'.
Output State: **'s' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'**
