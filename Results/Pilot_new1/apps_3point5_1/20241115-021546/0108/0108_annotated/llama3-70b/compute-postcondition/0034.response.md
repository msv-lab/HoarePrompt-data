According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, which means all characters have been iterated over. To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's' and 'char' is in 's'**
