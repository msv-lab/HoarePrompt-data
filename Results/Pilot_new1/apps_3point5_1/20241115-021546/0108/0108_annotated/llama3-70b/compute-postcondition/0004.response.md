Example Answer:
The current character `char` is added to the `res` string. The initial value of `res` is unknown, and `char` is the current character being iterated over in the alphabet string. Therefore, after executing the code, the `res` string will have the new character added to it.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, alphabet is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', res is the updated string after adding the current character**
