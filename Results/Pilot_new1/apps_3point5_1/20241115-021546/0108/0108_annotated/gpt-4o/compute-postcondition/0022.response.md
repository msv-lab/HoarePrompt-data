Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `target` is a string. If `j` is equal to the length of `target`, then `target` is printed. If `j` is less than 26, then -1 is printed. The loop will stop if `j` reaches 26 before `i` reaches the length of `s`. In all cases, the variables `i` and `j` retain their initial conditions based on the match between `s` and `target`.***
