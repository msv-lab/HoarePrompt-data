According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `s` and `char`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be present in the updated `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, only once; `char` is the character that was replaced in `s`; `res` contains the added character `char`**
