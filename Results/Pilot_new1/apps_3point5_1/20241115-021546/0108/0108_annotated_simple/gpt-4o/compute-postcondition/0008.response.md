According to the code, the loop can execute if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` should be incremented by 1.
- If `j` is already equal to `target_len`, then `j` should be reset to 0.
- If `j` is less than `target_len`, then `i` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, and if the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1.**
