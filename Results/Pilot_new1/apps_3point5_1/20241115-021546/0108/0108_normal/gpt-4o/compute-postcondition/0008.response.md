According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is an integer between 0 and 26. If the character at index `i` in `s` matches the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to be less than the length of `s` and `j` should be adjusted to be less than 26.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is adjusted accordingly, `j` is adjusted accordingly**
