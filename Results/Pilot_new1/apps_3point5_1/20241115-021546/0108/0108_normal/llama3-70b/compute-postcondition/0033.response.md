Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence in the string `s`. The previous state of `s` is known to contain all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters in order along with the newly added character replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence**
