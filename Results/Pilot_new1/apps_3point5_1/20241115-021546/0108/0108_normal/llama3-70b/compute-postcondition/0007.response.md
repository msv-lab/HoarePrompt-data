Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of the `res` string, which contains all small English letters in order. Since `char` is the next letter in the alphabet, the `res` string now contains all small English letters in order including the newly added `char`. The `s` variable is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order including the next letter in the alphabet, `char` is the next letter in the alphabet**
