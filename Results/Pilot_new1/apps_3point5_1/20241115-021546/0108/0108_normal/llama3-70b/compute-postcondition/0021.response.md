Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res`. The value of `char` is not specified, so the output state is: `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **`res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point or in order with the addition of the character that comes after the current `char` in the ASCII sequence**
