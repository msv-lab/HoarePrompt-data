Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of `res`. If the loop executes till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, and `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`. If the loop terminates early, `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point, and `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`.
Output State: **If the loop executes till the end, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`. If the loop terminates early, `res` contains all small English letters up to a certain point, `char` is the next small English letter after the last one in `res`**
