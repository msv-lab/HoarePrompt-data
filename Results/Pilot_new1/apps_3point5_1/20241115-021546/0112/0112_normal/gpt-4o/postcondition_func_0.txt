The function func_1 accepts two parameters `n` and `cubes`, where `n` is the starting point and `cubes` is a list of cubes. It iterates over the cubes to create sets of cube faces. Then, it increments the integer `x` until the function `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns false. The function returns the smallest integer `x` where this condition is met. If the function `can_form_number(1)` is false initially, the loop won't execute.
