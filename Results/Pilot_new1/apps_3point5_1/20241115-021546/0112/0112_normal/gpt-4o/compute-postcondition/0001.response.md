All cubes are initially marked as unused with `False` in the `used_cubes` list. The length of the list is `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Therefore, the Output State is: All cubes are marked as unused in the `used_cubes` list.
Output State: **All cubes are marked as unused in the `used_cubes` list**
