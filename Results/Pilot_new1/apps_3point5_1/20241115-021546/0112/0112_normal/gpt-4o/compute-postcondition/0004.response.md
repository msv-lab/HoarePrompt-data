According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the `used_cubes` list should have at least one cube marked as used, `digits` list should have at least 1 digit, `digit` should be the first digit in the list, and `found` should be initialized as `False`. So, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is initialized as `False`, `n` is greater than 0**
