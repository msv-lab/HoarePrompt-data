Example Answer:
The code removes the digit '0' from the set digits. Since the set digits contains the individual digits of the last cube in the list, and the last cube is cube, the set digits will no longer contain '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of cubes with at least one cube, digits is a set containing the individual digits of the last cube in the list without '0', cube is the last cube in the list.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of cubes with at least one cube, digits is a set containing the individual digits of the last cube in the list without '0', cube is the last cube in the list**
