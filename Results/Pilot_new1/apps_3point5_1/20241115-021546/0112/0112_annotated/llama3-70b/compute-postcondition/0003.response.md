According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one cube in the list `cubes`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, we can assume that the list `cubes` has at least one cube. Before the loop starts, `digits` is an empty set. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least one cube, and `cube` is the first cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least one cube, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
