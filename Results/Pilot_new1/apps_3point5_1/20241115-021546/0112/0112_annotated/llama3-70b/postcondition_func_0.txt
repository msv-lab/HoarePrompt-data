The function `func` reads an integer `n`, then reads `n` cubes each represented by a list of 6 integers. It extracts the individual digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and concatenates them to form a single integer. Finally, it prints the maximum integer formed by the digits. The functionality of the function is to find the maximum number that can be formed by the digits of the cubes, excluding '0'.
