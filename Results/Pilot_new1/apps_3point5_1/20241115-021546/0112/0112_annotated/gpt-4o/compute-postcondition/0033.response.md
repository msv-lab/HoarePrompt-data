Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, and `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. The function iterates through the digits of the input number and checks if there is at least one cube where each digit is present on one of the cube faces. If this condition is met for all digits, the function returns True. If there is a digit that cannot be formed by any cube face or if n is 0, the function returns False.**
