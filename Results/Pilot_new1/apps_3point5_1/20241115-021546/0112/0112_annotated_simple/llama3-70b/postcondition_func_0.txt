The function reads an integer n and n lists of integers. It then creates a set of all the digits present in the lists. If the digit '0' is in the set, it removes it. Finally, it forms the maximum possible number from the digits in the set and prints it. The function generates a random 3-digit number by selecting digits from the set and prints the maximum number possible.
