Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, converts it to a list of digits, and iterates through the used_cubes list to check if each digit is in cube_faces. If the condition is met for at least one digit, it sets the corresponding element in used_cubes to True and returns True. If the condition is not met for any digit, it returns False. The function may not handle cases where n is 0 or negative properly as the loop does not execute in those scenarios.**
