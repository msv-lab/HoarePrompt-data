Postcondition: ***`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `True`, `found` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. This ensures that the program maintains the initial conditions while updating the state of `used_cubes` and `found` based on the condition met in the if statement.***
