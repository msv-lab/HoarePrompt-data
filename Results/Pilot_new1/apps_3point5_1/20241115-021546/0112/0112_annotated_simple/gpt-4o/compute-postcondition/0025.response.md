According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `digits`. If `n` is greater than 0 and `digits` has at least one digit, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has executed at least once, so `n` is greater than 0. The `digits` list has at least one digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list. Additionally, `used_cubes` list has at least one element set to True if the condition is met, and `found` is True if the condition is met. To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that the next digit in the list becomes the current `digit`.
State: **`digits` list with at least one digit, `digit` being the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` list with at least one element set to True if the condition is met, and `found` being True if the condition is met**
