The function func_1 accepts an integer n and a list of n lists containing digits of cubes. It iterates through consecutive values starting from 0 until the function can_form_number no longer returns true for the next value. The function then returns the largest number of consecutive values starting from 0 for which can_form_number returns true. If can_form_number never returns true, the function will return 0.
