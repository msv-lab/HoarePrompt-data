Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained by splitting the input. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program covers all scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and the division and modulo operations meet the specified conditions.***
