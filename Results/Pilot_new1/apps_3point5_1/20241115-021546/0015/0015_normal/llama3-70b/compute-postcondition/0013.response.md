Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), then the program prints 'YES'. In all other cases, the program prints 'NO'.***
