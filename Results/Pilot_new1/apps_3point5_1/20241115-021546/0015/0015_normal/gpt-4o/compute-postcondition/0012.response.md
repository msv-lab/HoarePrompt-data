Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The value of `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
