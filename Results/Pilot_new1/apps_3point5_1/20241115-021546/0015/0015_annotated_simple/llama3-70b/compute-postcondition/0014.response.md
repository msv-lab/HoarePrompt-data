The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates without any input arguments. The function returns a string based on the following conditions:
- If the sum of a, b, and c is greater than 0, it returns "Positive sum".
- If the sum of a, b, and c is equal to 0, it returns "Zero sum".
- If the sum of a, b, and c is less than 0, it returns "Negative sum".

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the sum of three integers a, b, and c, and return a string indicating whether the sum is positive, zero, or negative.
