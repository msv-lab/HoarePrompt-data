Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
1. If the difference between neighboring elements is 0 (c = 0), the program checks if the favorite number b is equal to the first element a, and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise 'NO'.
2. If the difference between neighboring elements is not 0 (c != 0), the program checks if the favorite number b can be reached from the first element a by adding multiples of c, and prints 'YES' if it is reachable, otherwise 'NO'.
3. The program covers all scenarios and correctly determines whether the favorite number b appears in the sequence or not.
