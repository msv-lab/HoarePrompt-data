Output State: **total_sum is the sum of all numbers within the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition func_1(num, k) and are updated by (total_sum + num) % MOD, l is the starting value, r is the ending value where r is greater than or equal to l, and num iterates over the range [l, r]. If func_1(num, k) returns false for all numbers in the range, total_sum remains 0.**
