According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)`. If `num` is within the range `[l, r]` and `func_1(num, k)` returns true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returned true, `total_sum` was updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` is the starting value, `r` is the ending value where `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, and `num` is equal to `l`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `num` should be updated to the next integer after the last value it had in the previous iteration.
- If the updated `num` is still within the range `[l, r]`, then no changes are needed.
- If the updated `num` is outside the range `[l, r]`, then `l` should be updated to the next integer after the last value of `num`, and `r` should be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` where `num` is the next integer after the last value it had in the previous iteration within the range `[l, r]` based on the conditions of `func_1(num, k)`**
