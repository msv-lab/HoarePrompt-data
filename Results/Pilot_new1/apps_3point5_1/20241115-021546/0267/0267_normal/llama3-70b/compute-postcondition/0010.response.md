According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, the loop will execute `k-1` times. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer, so these values do not need to be adjusted. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be initialized to 1. 
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 1**
