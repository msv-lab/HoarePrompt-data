The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the difference between the counts of `r` and `l - 1` using the function `count`, and returns the result modulo MOD. The function does not handle cases where `l` or `r` are outside the specified constraints, and it relies on the implementation of the `count` function to provide accurate results.
