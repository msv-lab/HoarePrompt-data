Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`, which work together to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. The `func_1` function computes the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, while the `count` function handles the actual calculation based on the constraints provided in the problem description.

After examining the code and the annotations, it is evident that the program follows the problem description for every potential case. The `count` function correctly calculates the sum of numbers satisfying the given conditions, and the `func_1` function aggregates these results within the specified range `l` to `r`.

Additionally, the code annotations provide insights into the logic of the functions and summarize the state of the program after each block of code execution. The annotations align with the problem description and serve as a guide to understanding the functionality of the program.

Therefore, based on the code, the annotations, and the problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be **True** as it handles all potential cases as described.
