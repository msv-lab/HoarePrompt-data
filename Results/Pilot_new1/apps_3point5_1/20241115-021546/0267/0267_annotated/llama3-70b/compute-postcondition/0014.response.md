According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 3**
