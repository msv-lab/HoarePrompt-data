Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values. If (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, the function does not modify the state of n, k, or dp. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. n is larger than or equal to 10, dp[n, k] = 9**
