According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. To execute one more time, the next `num` value should be considered. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `num` is set to the new value of `l`. If `num` has not reached `r`, then `num` should be updated to the next integer value. No other changes need to be made.
State: **`total_sum`, `l` (possibly incremented by 1), `r`, `num` (updated to the next integer value)**
