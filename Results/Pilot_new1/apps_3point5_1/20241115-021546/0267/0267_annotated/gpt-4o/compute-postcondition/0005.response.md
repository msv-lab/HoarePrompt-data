According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain less than or equal to each other, and `num` retains its initial value of `l`. No changes occur if `func_1(num, k)` returns false.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` needs to be updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`.
- The value of `num` needs to be incremented by 1.
- If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain less than or equal to each other, and `num` is incremented by 1. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` is incremented by 1.**
