Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is the next integer after the current `num` within the range of `l` to `r`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` remains the starting point of the range, `r` remains the ending point of the range, and `num` is updated to the next integer after the current `num` within the range of `l` to `r`**
