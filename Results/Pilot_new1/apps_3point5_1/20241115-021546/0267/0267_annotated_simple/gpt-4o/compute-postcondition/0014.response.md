The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and the parameter `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the final value of `total_sum` after the loop execution. 
Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= 10. It returns the final value of `total_sum` after the loop execution.**
