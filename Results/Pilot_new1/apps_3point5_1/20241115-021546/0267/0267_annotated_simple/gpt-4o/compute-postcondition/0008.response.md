According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` remains the starting point of the range, `r` remains the ending point of the range, and `num` is updated to the next integer after the current `num` within the range of `l` to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, there are no changes to `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next integer after the current `num` within the range of `l` to `r` should be considered. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `num` will be updated to the next integer after the current `num`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, then no changes will be made to `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num`.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers with appropriate adjustments based on the conditions mentioned above**.
