Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If (n, k) is found in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If (n, k) is not found in dp, there is no change in the state of the variables. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. If n < 10 ** k, dp[n, k] is set to n. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated according to the provided formula and then taken modulo MOD. The postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the changes to the variables after the if else block executes.***
