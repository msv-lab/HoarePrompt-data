According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the given formula, and `i` has been incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Updated value of `dp[n, k]` based on the given formula, `i` is less than or equal to `k**
