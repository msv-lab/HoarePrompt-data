The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the given formula involving `i`, which is incremented by 1. The previous values of `dp[n, k]`, `n`, and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: Updated value of `dp[n, k]` based on the given formula, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **Updated value of `dp[n, k]` based on the given formula, `i` is incremented by 1**
