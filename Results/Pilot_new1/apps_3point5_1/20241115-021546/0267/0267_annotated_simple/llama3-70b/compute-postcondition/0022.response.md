The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer, `k`, which is a positive integer, and `dp`, which is a dictionary to store computed values. 

Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0.

Case 2: If (n, k) is found in `dp`, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`. If (n, k) is not found in `dp`, there is no change in the state of the variables. If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0.

Case 3: The function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]` if it exists, otherwise there is no change in the state of the variables. If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store computed values. The function returns 0 if `k` equals 0, and retrieves the value stored in `dp[n, k]` if it exists. If the value is not found in `dp`, the function does not modify the variables.
