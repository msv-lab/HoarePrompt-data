Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty with more characters to iterate, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string updated with the next character added if `c` is in `t_set`. If `c` is in `t_set`, the next character is appended to `n`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.***
