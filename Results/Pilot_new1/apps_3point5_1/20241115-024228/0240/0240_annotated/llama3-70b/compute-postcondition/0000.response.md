Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created by converting the string `t` into a set. The set `t_set` will contain unique characters from the string `t`. The previous values of `t` are known to be a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of n, t_set is a set containing unique characters from t**.
Output State: **s is a string representing a very large integer, t is a string representing a non-empty substring of n, t_set is a set containing unique characters from t**.
