Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string with the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character in `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to include `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.***
