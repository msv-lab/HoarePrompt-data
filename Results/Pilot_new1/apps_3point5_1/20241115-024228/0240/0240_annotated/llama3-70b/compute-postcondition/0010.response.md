Example Answer:
The next character `c` is concatenated to the string `n`. The variables `s` and `t` remain unchanged, `t_set` may or may not change depending on the uniqueness of the new character `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty with more characters to iterate, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is updated with the next character added.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty with more characters to iterate, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is updated with the next character added**
