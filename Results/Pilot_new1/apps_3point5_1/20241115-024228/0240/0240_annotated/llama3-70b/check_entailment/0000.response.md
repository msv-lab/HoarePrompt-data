Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The annotations mention that the function might not handle cases where `t_set` is empty, potentially leading to unexpected results if `t` is empty or contains duplicate characters. This means that the code may not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.

An example where the code may not work correctly is if `t` contains duplicate characters. In this case, the function may not correctly reconstruct the smallest possible initial integer `n` as required by the problem description. The code should be updated to handle such cases to ensure correctness.
