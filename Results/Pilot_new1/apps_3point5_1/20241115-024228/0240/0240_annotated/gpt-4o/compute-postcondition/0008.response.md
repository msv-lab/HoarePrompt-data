Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function is_valid_number(candidate, sub), then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
