Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the first possible combination of digits. If the function `is_valid_number` returns true for `candidate` and `sub`, then `candidate` is yielded. This covers all possible scenarios where the initial conditions are met and the function behaves as expected.***
