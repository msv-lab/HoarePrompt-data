Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, and the result is stored back in `n`. The previous value of `n` is a string, and `c` is also a string. Therefore, the output state is: `s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`.
Output State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`**
