Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, where `c` is a character. The result of this concatenation is stored back in `n`. The previous values of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`s` still has characters left to iterate through, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is an updated string**
