Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. Since the specific values of `candidate` and `chars` are not provided, the output state will be that the `candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`**
