Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the result of joining the permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars` represented by `perm`. The previous values of `candidate` and `perm` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`**
