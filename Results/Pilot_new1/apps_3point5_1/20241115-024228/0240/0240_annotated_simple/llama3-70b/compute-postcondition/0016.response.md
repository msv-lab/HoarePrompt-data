The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`. The function returns the integer value of 'n' after concatenating 't' for each character in 's' that is present in 't_set'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two strings `s` and `t`, and return the integer value of 'n' after concatenating 't' for each character in 's' that is present in 't_set'.
