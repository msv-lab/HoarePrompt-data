Example Answer: 
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The value of `perm` is unknown, so the exact value of `candidate` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of the next permutation of an unknown `perm`**
