Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes in the string received by Kate and the substring that Vasya remembers. It then generates all possible numbers by permutating the remaining characters after removing the substring from the original string. It checks if the generated number is valid by ensuring that the substring is present in the number and the length of the number is correct. Finally, it returns the smallest valid number.

The program generates all possible valid numbers by permutating the remaining characters, so it covers all possible combinations. Additionally, it checks for the validity of the generated numbers, ensuring that the substring is present and the length is correct. This approach guarantees that the smallest possible initial integer n is found.
