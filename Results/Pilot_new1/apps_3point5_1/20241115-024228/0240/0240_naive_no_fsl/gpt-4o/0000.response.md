Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the substring contains leading zeroes. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the substring can contain leading zeroes, but the program does not take this into account. This means that for certain inputs where the substring contains leading zeroes, the program will not produce the correct smallest integer n.
