According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, and `n` is the length of string `s`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`**
