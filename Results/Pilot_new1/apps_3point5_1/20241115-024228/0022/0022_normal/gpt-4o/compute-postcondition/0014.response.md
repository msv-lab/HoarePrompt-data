The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. After executing the function body, if the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in string `s` are not equal for any `i` in the range of `n // 2`, the function returns False. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the function returns True. The function does not alter the state of the variables `s` and `n`.
