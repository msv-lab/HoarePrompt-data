According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2**
