Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables `s`, `n`, and `i`.***
