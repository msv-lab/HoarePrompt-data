According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `is_spalindrome` is a boolean**
