Postcondition: ***s is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer representing the length of the string and n is at least 2, i is 0. If the character at index i in string s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at the two specified indices are not equal, ensuring that the program returns False in those instances.***
