Output State: **`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 0. The character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
