The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string. The length of the string can vary from 1 to 1000 characters, and it only consists of English letters. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000 and consists of only English letters.
Output State: **s is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000 and consists of only English letters**
