Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited. The program ensures that the palindrome property is maintained by checking the characters at symmetric positions within the string `s`.***
