Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is adjusted to the next value, `is_spalindrome` is False.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is adjusted to the next value, `is_spalindrome` is False**
