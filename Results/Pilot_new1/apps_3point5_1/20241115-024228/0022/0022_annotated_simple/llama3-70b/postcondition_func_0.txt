The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input and determines if the string is a palindrome. It iterates through the characters of `s` comparing symmetric positions to check for palindrome property. If a mismatch is found, it sets `is_spalindrome` to False and exits the loop. The function then prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, indicating `s` is a palindrome, otherwise it prints 'NIE'. The function does not explicitly return any value. The string `s` must be of length between 1 and 1000 and consist of only English letters.
