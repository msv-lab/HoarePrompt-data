Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is obtained by subtracting `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is between 6 and 9, `result` is calculated by adding `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`. The result is printed.**
