Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem. The code takes an integer `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0 based on the value of the remainder. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the code rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`, and if the remainder is greater than 5, the code rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. This logic aligns with the problem description, where Vasya wants to round the number to the nearest integer ending with 0.

The annotations provided in the code also confirm that the code covers all possible scenarios for the values of `n` and the remainder within the specified ranges. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are consistent with the expected behavior of the code. Therefore, based on the code, annotations, and problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
