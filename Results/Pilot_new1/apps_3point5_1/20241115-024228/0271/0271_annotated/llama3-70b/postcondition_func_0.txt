The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts `n` based on its last digit: if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` minus the last digit, otherwise, it prints `n` plus the difference between 10 and the last digit. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
