Example Answer:
The code subtracts the last digit of `n` from `n`, which is achieved by `n % 10`. Since the last digit of `n` is not 0 and is less than or equal to 5, the last digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Subtracting any of these values from `n` results in a number where the last digit is 0. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The last digit of n is not 0 and the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The last digit of n is not 0 and the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5**
