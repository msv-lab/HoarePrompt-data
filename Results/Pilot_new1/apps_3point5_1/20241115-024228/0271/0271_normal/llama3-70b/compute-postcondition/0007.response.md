Example Answer: 
The code adds the difference between 10 and the last digit of `n` to `n`. Since the last digit of `n` is larger than 5, the difference between 10 and the last digit is less than 10. Therefore, the sum of `n` and the difference will always be greater than `n`. The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the last digit of n is larger than 5.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the last digit of n is larger than 5**
