Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, calculates the `result`. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, `result` is obtained by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, `result` is obtained by adding `n` and (10 - `remainder`). This logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of how the code works.
