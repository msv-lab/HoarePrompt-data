The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, calculates the `result`. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, `result` is obtained by subtracting the remainder from `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, `result` is obtained by adding `n` and (10 - `remainder`). The function then prints the calculated `result`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
