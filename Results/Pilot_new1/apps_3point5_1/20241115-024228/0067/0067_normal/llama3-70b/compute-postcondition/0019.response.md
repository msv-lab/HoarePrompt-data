Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers from input and based on their values, it prints either '+', '-', '0', or '?'. If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y and not greater than y + z, it prints '-'. If x equals y and z equals 0, it prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
