Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input. It then calculates `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` based on the input values. 

If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the function prints a dash. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints a plus sign. Otherwise, it prints a question mark. 

The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
