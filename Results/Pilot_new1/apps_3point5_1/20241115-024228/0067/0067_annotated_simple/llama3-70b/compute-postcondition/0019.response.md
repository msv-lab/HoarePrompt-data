Functionality: The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, z from the user input. It then compares x with the sum of y and z. If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x is equal to y, it further checks if z is 0. If z is 0, it prints '0'; otherwise, it prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any output. Additionally, the annotations mention specific conditions for x, y, and z, but the code does not enforce these conditions.
