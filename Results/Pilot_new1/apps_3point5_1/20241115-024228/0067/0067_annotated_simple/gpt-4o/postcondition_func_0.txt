The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input, calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values, and then prints a specific character based on certain conditions. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
