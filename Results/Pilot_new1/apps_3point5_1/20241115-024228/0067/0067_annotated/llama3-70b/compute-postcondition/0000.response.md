Example Answer:
The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values based on the input provided after splitting the input by spaces. Since the input is expected to be non-negative integers within the range of 0 to 100, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be within that range after the assignment.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
