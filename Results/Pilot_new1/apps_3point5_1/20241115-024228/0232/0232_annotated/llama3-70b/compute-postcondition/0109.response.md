Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key is incremented by 1 if it already exists, or `color` is added as a new key with a value of 1. The variables `i` and `j` are less than `n+1`, `found` is True, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. All values in `window_counts` are sorted and equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. `j` is less than `n`.***
