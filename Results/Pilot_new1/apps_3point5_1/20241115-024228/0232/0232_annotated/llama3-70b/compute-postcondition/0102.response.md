Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` incremented by 1 if it already exists, otherwise `color` is added as a key with an incremented value of 1. `i` and `j` are less than `n+1`, `found` is True, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. All the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 1.**
