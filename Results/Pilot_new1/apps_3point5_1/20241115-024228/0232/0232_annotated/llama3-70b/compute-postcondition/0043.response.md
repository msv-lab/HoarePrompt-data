Postcondition: ***After checking if `color` is not in `window_counts`, the program ensures that `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains True, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is still `i+1`, `colors` list still has at least 1 color, and `window_counts` maintains `color` as a key with value 1 if `color` was not present in `window_counts` before.***
