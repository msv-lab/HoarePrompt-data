Output State: **After the loop executes, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of each color in the `colors` list. If `colors` is empty, `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `found` is True, it means that the condition for all counts matching the target counts is met and the loop breaks. If `found` is False and the loop completes all iterations without meeting the condition, `found` remains False. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and the variables retain their initial values.**
