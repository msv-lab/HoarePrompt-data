Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `color_counts` remains as an empty dictionary, `found` is set to True, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still less than `n+1`, `colors` list has at least 1 color, and `window_counts` dictionary contains `color` as key with value 1 if `color` was not present in `window_counts` before. All other variables maintain their initial values and relationships. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
