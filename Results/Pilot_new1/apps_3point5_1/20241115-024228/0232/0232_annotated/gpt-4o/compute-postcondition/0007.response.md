Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type; `left` is 0; `right` is 1; `n` is greater than 0. If all the counts of colors in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
