Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts based on the input lists `k` and `m`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with an integer type; `left` is 0; `right` is 1; `n` is greater than 0. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts equal to the corresponding counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no specific change in the state of the program.***
