Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as a key and the value 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[3]`, `colors` has at least 3 elements. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after the condition is met.**
