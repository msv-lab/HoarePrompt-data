Postcondition: ***n is at least 1, m is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of n integers, counts is a list of integers obtained from input, color_counts is a dictionary. If color is not present in color_counts, then color_counts[color] is assigned the value 0. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
