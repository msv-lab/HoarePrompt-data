Output State: **After the loop executes, color_counts contains the count of each color in the colors list. If a color is not already in color_counts, it is added with a count of 1. n and m remain positive integers, where 1 <= m <= n. If colors is an empty list, the loop does not execute and color_counts remains an empty dictionary.**
