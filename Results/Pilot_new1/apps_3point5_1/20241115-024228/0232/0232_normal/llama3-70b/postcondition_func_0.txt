The function reads input for the number of colors, the list of colors, and the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. It then iterates through the colors to check if there is a sequence of colors that matches the desired counts. If such a sequence is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters.
