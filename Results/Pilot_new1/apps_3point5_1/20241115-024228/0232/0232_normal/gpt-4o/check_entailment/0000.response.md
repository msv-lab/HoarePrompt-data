Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately follows the problem description by iterating through the colors list and adjusting the counts until the desired counts are met for all colors.
- The output hints also align with the code, indicating that the function returns 'YES' if all colors have their counts matching the desired counts, and 'NO' otherwise.
- The code covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description, ensuring that the mission can be successful if there is an interval with the prescribed color counts.
