Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where the count of `colors[right]` is incremented by 1; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and there exists at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts equal in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'.***
