According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there is a color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`. At the end of the last iteration, all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the count of at least one color in `current_counts` should be less than the count in `desired_counts`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the count of at least one color in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts'**.
