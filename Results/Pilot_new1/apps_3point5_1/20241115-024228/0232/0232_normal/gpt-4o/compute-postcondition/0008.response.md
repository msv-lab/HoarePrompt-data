According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the counts of colors in `current_counts` are greater than or equal to the counts of colors in `desired_counts`. If any color has a count in `current_counts` less than the count in `desired_counts`, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the counts in `current_counts` to be less than the counts in `desired_counts` for at least one color.

State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where the count of `colors[right]` is incremented by 1; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and there exists at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`.**
