Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where the count of `colors[right]` is incremented by 1; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
