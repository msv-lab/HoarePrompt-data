Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights to check if the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. It uses a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each color in the current interval and compares it with the desired counts. If the conditions are met, it outputs "YES", otherwise "NO". The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases, making the program correct.
