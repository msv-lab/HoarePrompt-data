According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least equal to i, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, window_counts is an empty dictionary does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to `i` and `j` is equal to `i`.
State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is equal to `j`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`**
