Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The loop does not execute in this case, so the state of `color_counts` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color from the colors list has a count representing the number of times it appears in the list. If colors is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.
Output State: **After the loop executes, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color from the colors list has a count representing the number of times it appears in the list. If colors is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
