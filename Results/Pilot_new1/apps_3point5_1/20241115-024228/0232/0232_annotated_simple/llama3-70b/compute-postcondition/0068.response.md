Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` is incremented by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is updated to the next value in the range from `i` to `n`, `n` remains the same or is greater than `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then it is added with the value 0.***
