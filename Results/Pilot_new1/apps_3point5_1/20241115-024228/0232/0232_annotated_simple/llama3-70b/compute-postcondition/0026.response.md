Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing `color` as a key with a value of 0, `i` is less than `n`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then it is added with a value of 0. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
