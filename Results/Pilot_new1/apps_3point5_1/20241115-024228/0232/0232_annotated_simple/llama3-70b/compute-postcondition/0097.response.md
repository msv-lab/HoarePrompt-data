Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key and the corresponding value is incremented by 1. `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. Furthermore, all values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. The variable `found` is set to True after the execution of the if statement. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and summarizes the overall state of the program after the if statement executes.***
