The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It calculates the counts of colors in the `colors` list and compares them with the desired counts in the `k` dictionary. If the initial state already satisfies the condition, 'YES' is returned immediately. Otherwise, the function adjusts the current counts and moves the left pointer until the condition is met, then 'YES' is returned. If the condition is never met, the function returns 'NO'. The function handles cases where the initial state already satisfies the condition and adjusts the counts accordingly to reach the desired state.
