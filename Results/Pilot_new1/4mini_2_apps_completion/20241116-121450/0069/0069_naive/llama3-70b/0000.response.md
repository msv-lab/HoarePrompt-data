To analyze the given program based on the problem description, let's break down the logic and see if it covers all potential cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The program needs to find the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t`, built by repeating a binary string `s`, that have a balance equal to `x`.
2. The balance is defined as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the prefix.
3. The output should be:
   - The number of valid prefixes.
   - `-1` if there are an infinite number of such prefixes.

### Program Logic:
1. The program counts the number of '0's (`cnt0`) and '1's (`cnt1`) in the string `s`.
2. It calculates the initial balance of the string `s` as `balance = cnt0 - cnt1`.
3. It checks:
   - If the initial balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1` (indicating all prefixes including the empty one are valid).
   - If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the net balance of the infinite string (i.e., `cnt0 - cnt1`), it prints `-1` (indicating infinite valid prefixes).
   - Otherwise, it calculates and prints the number of valid prefixes based on the formula `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Division by Zero**: The program does not handle the case where `cnt0 - cnt1` is zero. This situation occurs when the string `s` has an equal number of '0's and '1's. In this case, if `balance` does not equal `x`, the program should not attempt to perform the division or check for infinite prefixes, as it would lead to a division by zero error.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix Count**: The current logic for calculating the number of valid prefixes may not account for cases where the balance is unreachable due to the nature of the string.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case where `s = "01"` (which has equal counts of '0's and '1's):
- If `x = 1`, the balance is `0 - 1 = -1`, and since `cnt0 - cnt1 = 0`, the program will attempt to perform `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` which leads to division by zero.

### Conclusion:
Due to the oversight in handling the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
