Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (3 <= T <= 102), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)`, which is the quotient of `(x - balance)` divided by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` incremented by 1. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the case where `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is zero should be handled to avoid division by zero, which is not explicitly covered in the code.***
