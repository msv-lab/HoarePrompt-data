The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. This does not change the values of any variables, so the output state reflects the initial values of the variables. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (2 <= T <= 101), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.
