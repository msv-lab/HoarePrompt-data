Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1` (not equal to `x`). If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1, indicating that the difference is perfectly divisible by the count difference. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of additional operations needed to achieve the balance. This covers all cases based on the relationship between `x`, `balance`, and the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.***
