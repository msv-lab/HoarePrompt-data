According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one element, and since the loop iterates over `results`, it must be adjusted to reflect that one element has been consumed.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements after the last iteration, as one element will be removed during the current iteration. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `results` must contain at least two elements, and since `result` represents the current element in the loop, it will be the first element in the list.

State: **`results` contains at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the function prints the contents of `results`.**
