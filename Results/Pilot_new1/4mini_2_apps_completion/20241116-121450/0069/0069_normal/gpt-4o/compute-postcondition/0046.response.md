The variable `index` is incremented by 3, which affects its previous value. However, the values of `prefix_balances`, `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `index` after the increment.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.**
