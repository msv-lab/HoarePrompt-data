The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` retrieves a value from the `data` list at the specified `index`, and `int` converts that value to an integer. The variable `prefix_balances` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `n` based on the input from `data`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to n, `T` is greater than 0, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])**
