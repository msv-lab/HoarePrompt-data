Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of times `x - b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` for each `b` in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include this count. In all cases, the state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and the length of `results` increases by 1.***
