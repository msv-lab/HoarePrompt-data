According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 2 elements. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, it should contain at least 3 elements. The variable `result` will be the third element in the list during the next iteration.

State: **`results` contains at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the function prints the contents of `results`.**
