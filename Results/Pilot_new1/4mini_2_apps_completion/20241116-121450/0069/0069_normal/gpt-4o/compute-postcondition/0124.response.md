According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more element in the `results` list after the last iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must contain at least 4 elements.

Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the `result` variable will refer to the next element in the list. If the loop has already processed 3 elements, then `result` would need to refer to the fourth element in the list.

State: **`results` contains at least 4 elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the function prints the contents of `results`.**
