The value of `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is an element from the `data` list. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `results`, `T`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `x`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, `results` has increased by 1, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, and `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]**.
