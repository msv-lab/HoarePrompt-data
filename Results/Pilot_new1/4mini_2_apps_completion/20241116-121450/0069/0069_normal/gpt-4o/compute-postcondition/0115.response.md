Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, representing cumulative balances after processing characters of `s`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` will include -1; if not, `results` will include 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is computed based on the elements in `prefix_balances`, where `count` is incremented for each `b` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` will contain this count. The case where `n` is 0 or lower is also handled, resulting in `prefix_balances` remaining a list of zeros and `results` being updated accordingly.***
