According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means the loop cannot execute again since `i` exceeds `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n`, and since the loop iterates from `1` to `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i]` should correspond to `prefix_balances[n]`. The values of `prefix_balances[1]` and `prefix_balances[n]` do not need to be modified, as they remain unchanged in the context of the loop's execution.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Set `i` to `n`
- `prefix_balances[i]` should be `prefix_balances[n]`, as it is defined at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[0]` is unchanged; `prefix_balances[1]` is either `prefix_balances[0] + 1` or `prefix_balances[0] - 1`; `i` is `n`; `prefix_balances[i]` is either `prefix_balances[n] + 1` or `prefix_balances[n] - 1`**
