Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance after processing the first `i` characters of `s`. The value of `balance` is 0, indicating that the total balance after processing the characters is neutral. If `n` is at least 1, then `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, and subsequent elements are updated based on the characters processed. The value `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros.***
