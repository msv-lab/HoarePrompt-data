The value of `index` is incremented by 3, affecting the previous value of `index`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, `results` has increased by 1, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
