Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all 0s. If `(x - b) % balance` equals 0 and `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This accounts for the case where `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, which is 0, and considers scenarios where `x` is equal to `b`, less than `b`, or greater than `b` in relation to the `balance`.***
