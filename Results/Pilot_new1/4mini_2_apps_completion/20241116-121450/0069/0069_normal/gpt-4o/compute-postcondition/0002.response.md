The value of `T` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, where `data` is a list containing input values split by whitespace. The specific value of `data[0]` is not provided, but it is guaranteed to be a valid positive integer within the specified range (1 to 100). Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1', `data` is a list containing the input values split by whitespace, and `T` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`**.
