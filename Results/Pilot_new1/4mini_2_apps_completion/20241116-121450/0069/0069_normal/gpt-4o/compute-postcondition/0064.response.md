The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The previous state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where the balance is not equal to 0; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where the balance is not equal to 0; `count` is 0**
