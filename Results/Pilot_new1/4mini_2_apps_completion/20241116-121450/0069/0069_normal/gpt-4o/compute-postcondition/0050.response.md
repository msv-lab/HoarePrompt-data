The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either `1` or `-1`, depending on whether the character at position `i - 1` in the string `s` is `'0'` or `'1'`. Since `i` is `1`, we are accessing `prefix_balances[1]` and `prefix_balances[0]`. The value of `prefix_balances[0]` remains unchanged, and the calculation of `balance` does not directly affect this assignment. 

If `s[0]` is `'0'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `prefix_balances[0] + 1`. If `s[0]` is `'1'`, then `prefix_balances[1]` will be `prefix_balances[0] - 1`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[1]` based on the character at `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[0]` is unchanged; `prefix_balances[1]` is either `prefix_balances[0] + 1` or `prefix_balances[0] - 1` depending on `s[0]` being '0' or '1'**
