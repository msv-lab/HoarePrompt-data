Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2`, `count` is either 2 or 3, and `b` is the last element in the list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 3. If the condition is not met, `count` remains either 1 or 2.***
