Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where each '0' increases the balance by 1 and each '1' decreases it by 1. The balance is equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances[1]` through `prefix_balances[n]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop has not executed, and `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.***
