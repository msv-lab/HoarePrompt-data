Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where the balance is equal to 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include 0. In either case, the state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and the length of `results` increases by 1.***
