According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. If `prefix_balances` contains more balances, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the first balance in `prefix_balances`, and since `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 balance, we need to ensure that `b` is updated to the next balance in the list. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `b` must be the second balance in `prefix_balances`, and `prefix_balances` must contain at least 2 balances.

State: **`count` is 0 or 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 balances, `b` is the second balance in `prefix_balances`**
