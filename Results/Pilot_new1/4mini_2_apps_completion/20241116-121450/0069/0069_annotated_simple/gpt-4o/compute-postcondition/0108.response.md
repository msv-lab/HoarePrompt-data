Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `count` is 2 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, otherwise `count` remains 1. The condition checks ensure that `x - b` is a multiple of `balance` and non-negative, which are critical for determining the increment of `count`.***
