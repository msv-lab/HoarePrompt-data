The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The previous state of `results` is not specified, but it will now include `0` as a new element. The other variables, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `balance` is 0, `x` is not an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes a `0`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `balance` is 0, `x` is not an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes a `0`**
