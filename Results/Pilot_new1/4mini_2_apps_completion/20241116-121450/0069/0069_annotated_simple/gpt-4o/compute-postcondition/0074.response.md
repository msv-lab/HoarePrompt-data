Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 2, `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This captures the scenarios where the conditions are met or not, ensuring all edge cases regarding the divisibility and non-negativity are addressed.***
