The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and the addition of `-1` to `results`. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**
