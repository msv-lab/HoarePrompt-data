The line of code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation. The values of `n`, `balance`, `results`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `prefix_balances`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `balance` is the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned a value from `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.**
