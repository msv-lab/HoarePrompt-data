The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it affects the next accesses to `data`. The states of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned a value from `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
