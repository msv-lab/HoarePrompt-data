Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's from the first `i` characters of `s`. The value of `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `n + 1` initialized to all 0's.***
