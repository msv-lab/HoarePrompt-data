The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Since the previous value of `index` is 1, after the execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, and `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list**
