According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 1, which means it has executed the loop body for `i = 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The value of `n` does not change, and we do not have information about `prefix_balances` or `s` that would affect the state regarding whether the loop can continue. Thus, we only need to adjust the state of `i`.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged**
