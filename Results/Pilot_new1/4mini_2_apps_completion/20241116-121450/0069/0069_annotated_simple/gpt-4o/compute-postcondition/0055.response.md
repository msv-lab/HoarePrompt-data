According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to 4, and `n` needs to remain unchanged since it is already greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`prefix_balances` at index 3 is updated based on `s[2]`, `balance` is unchanged, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 4**
