Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`. If the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
