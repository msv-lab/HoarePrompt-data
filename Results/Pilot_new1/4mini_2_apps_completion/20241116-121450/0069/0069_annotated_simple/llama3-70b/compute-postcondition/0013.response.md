Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1, which accounts for all cases where `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero. Additionally, if both `cnt0` and `cnt1` are equal, the behavior will depend on the specific values of `x` and `balance` since (x - balance) would not be divisible by zero, which is an edge case to consider.***
