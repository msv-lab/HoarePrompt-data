Postcondition: ***`T` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for cases where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` (leading to potential division by zero) and ensures that the output is correctly calculated for valid values of `cnt0` and `cnt1`.***
