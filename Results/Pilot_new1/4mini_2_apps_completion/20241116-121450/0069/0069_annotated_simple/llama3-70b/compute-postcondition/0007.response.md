The code `print(n + 1)` outputs the value of `n + 1`. The variable `n` is an input integer whose value is not specified but is known to be an integer. Therefore, after execution, the output will reflect the incremented value of `n`.

Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state will include the information about `n` and the printed result.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, the balance (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to `x`, and the printed result is `n + 1`.**
