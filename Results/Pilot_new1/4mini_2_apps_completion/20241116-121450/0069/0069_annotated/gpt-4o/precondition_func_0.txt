T is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of string s, and x is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the desired balance; s is a binary string of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
