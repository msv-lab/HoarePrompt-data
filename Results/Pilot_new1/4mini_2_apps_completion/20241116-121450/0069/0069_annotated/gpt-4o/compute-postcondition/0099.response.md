Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` remains unchanged (all zeros) and an additional element 0 is appended to it. This accounts for cases where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, leading to potential modifications in `results`, as well as cases where `n` is 0 or lower, leaving `prefix_balances` unchanged.***
