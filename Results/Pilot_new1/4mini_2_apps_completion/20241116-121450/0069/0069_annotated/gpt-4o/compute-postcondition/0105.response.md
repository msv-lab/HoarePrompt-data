Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is an integer. If the difference between `x` and the first element `b` of `prefix_balances` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the difference is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, `count` remains 0.***
