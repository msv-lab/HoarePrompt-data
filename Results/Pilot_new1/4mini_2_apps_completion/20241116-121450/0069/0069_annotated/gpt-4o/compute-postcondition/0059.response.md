The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and the `results` list now includes `-1`. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i-1`; `results` now includes `-1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i-1`; `results` now includes `-1`**
