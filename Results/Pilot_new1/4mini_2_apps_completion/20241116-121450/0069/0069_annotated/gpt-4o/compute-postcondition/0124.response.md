According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `results` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 elements and `result` is the third element in `results`. For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least 4 elements, and `result` should be the fourth element in `results`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `results` contains at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in `results`**
