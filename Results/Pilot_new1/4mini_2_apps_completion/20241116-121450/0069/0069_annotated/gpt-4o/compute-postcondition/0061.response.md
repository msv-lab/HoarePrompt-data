The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The previous state of `results` is not specified, but the action of appending does not alter any other variables. Therefore, the output state indicates that `results` now includes an additional element, which is `0`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i-1`; `results` now includes an additional element, which is 0.**
