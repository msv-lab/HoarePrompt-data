The code snippet `results.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The previous state of the variables does not change except for the addition of `0` to `results`. The variable `balance` remains `0`, and `prefix_balances` is unchanged. The output state reflects the inclusion of `0` in `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, and `results` includes the value 0**.
