Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of string `s`, `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) representing the desired balance; `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The input is read from standard input.**
