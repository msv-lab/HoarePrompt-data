According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. To ensure the loop can run again, `n` must also be at least 4, because if `n` were exactly 3, the loop would not execute again since `i` would then exceed `n`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be adjusted to 4.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 3 based on `prefix_balances[2]` and `s[2]`; `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
