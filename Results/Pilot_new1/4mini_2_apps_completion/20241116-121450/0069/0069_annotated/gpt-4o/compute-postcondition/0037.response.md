Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2`, `count` is initialized to 0, and `b` is the first element of the list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied. If the condition is not met, `count` remains 0. This accounts for cases where `x` is equal to `b`, `x` is greater than `b` and divisible by `balance`, or where the conditions do not hold true.***
