Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, and `balance` is the result of this calculation. If `balance` is 0, then if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; otherwise, an additional element 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which the difference `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and `results` is updated to include the value of `count`. This captures all scenarios including when `n` is greater than or equal to 1, leading to modifications in `results`, as well as when `n` is 0 or lower, leaving `prefix_balances` unchanged.***
