Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1; otherwise, `results` includes 0. This accounts for the case where `x` may be equal to any of the cumulative balances represented in `prefix_balances`, including the edge case where `x` is the first or last element of the list.***
