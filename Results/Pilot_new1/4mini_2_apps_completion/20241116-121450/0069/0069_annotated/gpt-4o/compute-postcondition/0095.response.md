Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the result of adding 1 for each '0' and subtracting 1 for each '1' up to index `i`. `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` are equal. The value `x` is present in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, and `i` is equal to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop did not execute, leaving `prefix_balances` unchanged (all zeros).***
