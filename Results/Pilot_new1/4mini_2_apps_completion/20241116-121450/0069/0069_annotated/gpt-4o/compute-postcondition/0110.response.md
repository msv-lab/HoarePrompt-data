The value of `count` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `count` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `b`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 2, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`**
