According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented. 

To prepare for the next iteration:
- The value of `i` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
- The condition for `n` must still hold, meaning it should be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted since `results` is already an empty list, and `prefix_balances[1]` has been updated based on previous values.

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `prefix_balances[1]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[0]` and `s[1]`.**
