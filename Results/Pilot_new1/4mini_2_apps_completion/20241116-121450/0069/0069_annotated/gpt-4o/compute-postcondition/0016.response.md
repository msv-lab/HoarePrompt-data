According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop iterates as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. Additionally, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 to allow for this iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`; `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
