Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `prefix_balances[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, and the value of `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances`, otherwise if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length `1`.***
