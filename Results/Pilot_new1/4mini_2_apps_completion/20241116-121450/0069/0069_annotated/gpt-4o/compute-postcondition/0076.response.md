Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `prefix_balances` is empty or contains only zeros, the loop will not execute and `count` will also remain 0. If `balance` is 0, the condition `(x - b) % balance` will raise an error, thus the loop will not execute, and `count` remains 0.**
