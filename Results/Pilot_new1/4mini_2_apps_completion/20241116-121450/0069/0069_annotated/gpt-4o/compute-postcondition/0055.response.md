According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Since the current state indicates that `i` is 2, we need to adjust `i` to 3. We do not have specific information about `n`, so we must assume that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `i` is 3; `n` is at least 3**
