The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not defined prior to this operation, but they will now hold the counts based on the contents of `s`. The variable `balance` is also affected indirectly since it is defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`, but its value will depend on the newly calculated counts. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` based on the input string `s`.

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
