Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, `T` is greater than the previous iteration count, `n` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the function prints -1, indicating that the balance cannot change. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of iterations required to reach the balance from `x`. Additionally, if `x - balance` is not divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, the result will be adjusted accordingly.***
