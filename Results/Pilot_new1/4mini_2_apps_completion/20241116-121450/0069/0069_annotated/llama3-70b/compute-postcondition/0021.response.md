The code prints `-1`, which does not change the values of the variables `cnt0`, `cnt1`, or `balance`. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the variable values. The output state is: `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `-1`.

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1**
