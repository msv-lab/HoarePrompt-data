The line `n, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated values from the input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `x`. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5) and `x` is an integer within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The input will overwrite the previous values of `n` and `x`, but the exact values depend on the input provided.

Since the initial state gives no specific values for `n` and `x`, we can only describe that they will be updated to new integer values from the input. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a new positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is a new integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9)**
