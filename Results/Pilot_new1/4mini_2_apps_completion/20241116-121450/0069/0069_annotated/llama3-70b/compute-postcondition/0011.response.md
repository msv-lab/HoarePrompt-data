Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. The value of `x` is such that the difference `(x - balance)` is not divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`.***
