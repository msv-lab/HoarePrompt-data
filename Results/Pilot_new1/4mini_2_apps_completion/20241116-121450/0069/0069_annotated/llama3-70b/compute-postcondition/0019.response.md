The variable `balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not specified, but `balance` will be calculated based on these counts. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between the counts of '0's and '1's.

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
