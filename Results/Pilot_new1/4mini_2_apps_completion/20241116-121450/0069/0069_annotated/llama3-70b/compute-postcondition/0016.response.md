The values of `n` and `x` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts two integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `x` after the input is processed.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (2 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
