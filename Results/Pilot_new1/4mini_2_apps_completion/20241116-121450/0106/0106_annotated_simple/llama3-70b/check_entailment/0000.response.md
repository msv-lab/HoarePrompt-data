To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step and see if it handles all cases correctly.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**:
   - `n`: number of entrances
   - `m`: number of floors per entrance
   - `k`: number of apartments per floor
   - `a`: apartment number of Edward
   - `b`: apartment number of Natasha

2. **Outputs**:
   - The minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

3. **Movement**:
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - The elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor traveled.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    
    a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
    a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
    b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    
    min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
    
    if (a_floor > b_floor):
        min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
    else:
        min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
    
    print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Floor and Block Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and the block (`a_block`, `b_block`) for both Edward and Natasha based on their apartment numbers.

2. **Block Transition Time**:
   - `min_block_time` computes the minimum time to move between blocks (entrances) considering the circular nature of the building.

3. **Floor Transition Time**:
   - The `if` condition calculates the time taken to move between floors, accounting for the elevator waiting time.

### Issues Identified
1. **Elevator Logic**: The elevator logic is not correctly implemented. The elevator is only considered when moving down in the `if` statement. If `a_floor` is less than `b_floor`, it doesn't account for the elevator time correctly since it should always consider the elevator for both up and down movements.
   - The elevator's arrival time of 10 seconds should be added regardless of the direction of movement.

### Example Case Where It Fails
Consider the following case:
- `n = 1`, `m = 2`, `k = 1` (a single entrance with 2 floors and 1 apartment per floor)
- `a = 2` (Edward is on the 2nd floor of entrance 1)
- `b = 1` (Natasha is on the 1st floor of entrance 1)

Expected output:
- Edward should take the elevator down (10 seconds for arrival + 1 second for the trip down = 11 seconds). The program only calculates the time based on stairs and doesn't consider the elevator for the upward movement.

### Conclusion
The program fails to consider the elevator time correctly in all scenarios, specifically for upward movement and when the elevator is a better option than stairs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
