The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are not provided directly, but it is stated that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`. Therefore, `a_floor - b_floor` is a positive integer. 

Since we do not have the specific values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`, we can denote `a_floor - b_floor` as `x`, where `x` is a positive integer. Thus, `min_floor_time` can be expressed as `x * 5 + 10`.

The output state will include the information about the calculation of `min_floor_time` based on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`.

Output State: **`min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`, where `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`**.
