The function accepts five parameters: integers `n`, `m`, and `k` representing the dimensions of a building, and integers `a` and `b` representing two locations within that building. It calculates and returns the total time required to exit from location `a` to location `b`, which includes the time to exit the floor, the minimal walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function assumes that the locations are valid and that `a` and `b` are different.
