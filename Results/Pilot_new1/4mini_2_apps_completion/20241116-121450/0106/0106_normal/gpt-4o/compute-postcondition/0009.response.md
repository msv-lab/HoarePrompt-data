To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the calculations for `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on the initial state. However, since the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the impact of the code.

1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
2. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
3. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Since we don't have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`, we can only conclude that `min_walk_time` will hold the minimum of the two calculated times based on the initial values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on the calculations.**
