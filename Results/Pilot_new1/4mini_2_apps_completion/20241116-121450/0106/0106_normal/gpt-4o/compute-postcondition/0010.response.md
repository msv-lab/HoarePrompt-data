The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `time_to_target_floor`. However, we can express `time_to_target_floor` in terms of `floor_b`. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`**
