Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment`, calculates which block and floor the apartment is located in based on the dimensions of the building (represented by `m` and `k`), and returns the corresponding block and floor numbers. The function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are zero, which could lead to division errors or incorrect calculations. Additionally, the function assumes that the apartment number is valid and does not check for negative or zero values of `apartment`. **
