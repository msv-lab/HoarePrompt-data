The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `m` and `k` are positive integers, and `b` is also a positive integer from input. The previous calculation of `b_floor` does not affect this new assignment. Therefore, the output state will include the newly calculated value of `b_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers from input; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
