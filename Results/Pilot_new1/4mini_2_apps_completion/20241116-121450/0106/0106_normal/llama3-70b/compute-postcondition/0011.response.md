Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. This ensures that `min_floor_time` accounts for the difference in floors between `a` and `b`, with a base time of 10 added to the calculated time based on the floor difference multiplied by 5.***
