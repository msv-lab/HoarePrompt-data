Functionality: ** The function accepts five integer inputs: three positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and two integers `a` and `b` representing apartment numbers. It calculates the minimum time to travel between the two apartments based on their respective floors and blocks in a building. The total time is computed as the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time, where the block time is determined by the distance between the blocks of `a` and `b`, and the floor time is determined by the difference in floors, with additional base time added. The function prints the total time required for the journey. **
