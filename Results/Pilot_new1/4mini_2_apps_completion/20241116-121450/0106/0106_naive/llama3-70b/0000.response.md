To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and identify any potential cases where it may fail.

### Given Problem Breakdown:
1. The building has a certain number of blocks (n), floors (m), and apartments (k) per floor.
2. Edward and Natasha live in different apartments, and the program must calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha.
3. The movement options include:
   - Using stairs (5 seconds per floor).
   - Moving between blocks (15 seconds).
   - Using the elevator (10 seconds wait + 1 second per floor).

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program calculates the floor and block (entrance) for both Edward and Natasha using:
   - `a_floor` and `b_floor` for the floors.
   - `a_block` and `b_block` for the blocks.
   
2. It calculates the time required to move between blocks using:
   - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`

3. The time to move between floors is calculated based on whether Edward's floor is above or below Natasha's:
   - If `a_floor > b_floor`, it calculates the time for descending.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time for ascending.

4. The total time is printed as the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program calculates the block index incorrectly. The formula used to determine `a_block` and `b_block` is:
  ```python
  a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
  ```
  This assumes that the apartments are numbered in a way that each block contains `m * k` apartments. However, the correct way to determine the block number should be:
  ```python
  a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1  # This part is correct.
  ```
  But the calculation of the floors (`a_floor`) is also based on the wrong division in some cases.

- The program does not handle the case when both apartments are on the same floor. In that case, the elevator wait time should not be included in the calculation if Edward is already on the first floor.

### Example Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider the case where:
- Input:
  ```
  1 1 1
  1 2
  ```
- Expected behavior:
  - Edward is in apartment 1, Natasha is in apartment 2. Since there is only one block, one floor, and one apartment per floor, Edward cannot reach Natasha as they are in different apartments but on the same floor.
  
- The program logic incorrectly assumes that the elevator wait time and floor time calculations are applicable, which leads to a misleading output.

### Conclusion:
Given these observations, the program does not correctly handle all edge cases and has a logical flaw in determining the block and floor transitions. 

Correctness: **False**.
