The function accepts input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates the floor and block numbers for `a` and `b`, and then computes the minimum time required to travel between the two points based on these calculations. It returns the sum of the time spent moving between blocks and floors, which is printed as output. The function does not handle any input validation or cases where `a` and `b` are not distinct integers, nor does it specify behavior for invalid inputs.
