Postcondition: ***`a_floor` is calculated as ((`a` - 1) % `m`) + 1; `a_block` is defined as ((`a` - 1) // (`m` * `k`)) + 1; `b_floor` cannot be evaluated; `b_block` is defined as ((`b` - 1) // (`m` * `k`)) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(`a_block` - `b_block`), `n` - abs(`a_block` - `b_block`)) * 15; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.***
