Output State: **`a_floor` is calculated as ((`a` - 1) % `m`) + 1; `b_floor` cannot be evaluated; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `b_block` is defined as ((`b` - 1) // (`m` * `k`)) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(`a_block` - `b_block`), `n` - abs(`a_block` - `b_block`)) * 15; the output is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
