The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` takes input values and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, but they will now hold the values provided in the input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input, and `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b**
