To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the functionality described in the problem statement and the corresponding code.

### Problem Description Summary:
- The building has `n` entrances, `m` floors per entrance, and `k` apartments per floor.
- Apartments are numbered sequentially.
- Edward and Natasha live in apartments `a` and `b`, respectively.
- Edward can move vertically (up/down) using stairs or a lift, and horizontally between entrances.
- The goal is to find the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function calculates the entrance (block) and floor for a given apartment number. 
   - The calculation appears to be correct based on the provided logic for determining the block and floor.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - The function retrieves the locations of Edward's and Natasha's apartments.
   - It calculates the time it takes for Edward to exit his entrance:
     - If he is on the first floor, the exit time is `0`.
     - If he is on a higher floor, it takes `10 seconds` (waiting for the lift) plus `floor_a - 1 seconds` (time taken by the lift to reach the first floor).
   - It calculates the time to walk to Natasha's entrance in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions, taking the minimum of the two.
   - Finally, it adds the time taken to reach Natasha's floor after arriving at her entrance.

### Potential Issues:
- The calculation of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` assumes that the distance between entrances is always measured in terms of the number of entrances, multiplied by `15 seconds`. 
- However, the code does not handle the case where the entrances wrap around correctly in terms of time calculation. Specifically:
  - The calculation of `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15` might not correctly account for the scenario when `block_a` and `block_b` are on opposite sides of the circular arrangement.
  
### Example Case Where the Code May Fail:
Consider the case:
- `n = 4`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
- `a = 1` (1st apartment), `b = 4` (4th apartment)

In this scenario:
- Edward is at entrance 1, floor 1.
- Natasha is at entrance 4, floor 1.

The expected walking time should be `3 * 15 = 45 seconds` (going clockwise from entrance 1 to entrance 4). However, the code calculates the direct and reverse walking times incorrectly due to the circular nature of the entrances, potentially leading to an incorrect minimum walking time.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential failure in calculating the walking time correctly in certain circular arrangements of entrances, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
