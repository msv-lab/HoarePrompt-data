To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and code snippet. 

Initial State: `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)

The code snippet:
```
floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
```

Now, let's break it down:
1. `floor_within_block` has a value that results from the operation (apartment - 1) % (m * k). We do not have specific values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`, but we know that `floor_within_block` is defined based on these variables.
2. The code assigns `floor` the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. This means `floor` is calculated as the integer division of `floor_within_block` by `k`, then incremented by 1.

Since we don't have specific values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `floor`. However, we can state that `floor` is based on the calculation involving `floor_within_block`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the relationship between the variables, acknowledging that `floor` is derived from `floor_within_block`.

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`**
