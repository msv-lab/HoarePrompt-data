Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and two locations `a` and `b`, calculates the time to exit from location `a`, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor from location `b`. It returns the total time computed as the sum of these times. The function assumes that the locations `a` and `b` are valid and differ from each other, and it handles various cases for the floor level of `a`.**
