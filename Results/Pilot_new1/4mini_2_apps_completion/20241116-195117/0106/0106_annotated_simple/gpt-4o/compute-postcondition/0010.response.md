To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables.

1. The variable `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. 
2. The initial state does not provide specific values for `floor_b`, `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, or `min_walk_time`.
3. However, we know that `time_to_target_floor` will be computed based on the value of `floor_b`. 

Since the initial state does not specify `floor_b`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `time_to_target_floor` is now dependent on `floor_b`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5**.
