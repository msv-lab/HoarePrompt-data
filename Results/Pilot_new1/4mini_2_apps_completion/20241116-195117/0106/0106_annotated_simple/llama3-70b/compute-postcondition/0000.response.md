The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from `input().split()`, which accepts a space-separated string of integers and converts them into integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified but are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. Other variables (`a` and `b`) are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `k` have been updated with the new integer values from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` remain distinct integers representing apartment numbers.**
