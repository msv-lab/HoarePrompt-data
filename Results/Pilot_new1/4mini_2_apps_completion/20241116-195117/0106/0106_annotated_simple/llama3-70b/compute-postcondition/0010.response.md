The value of `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The previous values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are used to compute this. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_block`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are integers; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `k`; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
