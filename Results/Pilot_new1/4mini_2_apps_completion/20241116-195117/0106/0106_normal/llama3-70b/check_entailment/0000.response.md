To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the code and examine its logic.

### Problem Description Overview:
1. The building has `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
2. Apartments are numbered sequentially.
3. Edward and Natasha live in different apartments `a` and `b`.
4. Edward can move vertically (between floors) and horizontally (between blocks), with specific time costs associated with each type of movement.
5. The goal is to compute the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
if a_floor > b_floor:
    min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
else:
    min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
2. **Floor and Block Calculation**:
   - `a_floor` and `b_floor` are calculated using modulo operation to determine the floor number.
   - `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated using integer division to determine the block number.
3. **Time Calculation**:
   - `min_block_time` calculates the minimum time to move between blocks, considering the circular nature of the building.
   - `min_floor_time` calculates the time to move between floors, factoring in elevator wait time and travel time.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle cases where `n`, `m`, or `k` might be zero or negative, which could lead to invalid calculations.
- The program assumes `a` and `b` are always different, but it does not check for this condition.
- The calculations for `min_floor_time` might not correctly account for scenarios where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor, leading to unnecessary elevator wait time.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
- The function calculates the minimum time required to move between two floors and blocks.
- It mentions that the function does not handle out-of-range input values or the case where `a` equals `b`.

### Conclusion:
The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, particularly:
1. It does not handle the scenario where `n`, `m`, or `k` could be zero.
2. It assumes valid inputs without validation.
3. The elevator wait time may be incorrectly applied when both are on the same floor.

Thus, based on the analysis, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
