The value of `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values, and `a` is also an input integer. The expression `(a - 1) // (m * k)` performs integer division, and then 1 is added to the result. The exact value of `a_block` depends on the specific values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, but the output state will reflect that `a_block` has been computed. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `a_block` is computed as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
