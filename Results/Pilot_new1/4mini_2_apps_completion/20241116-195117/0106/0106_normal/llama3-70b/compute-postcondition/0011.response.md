Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` and `b_floor` are integers within the range 1 to `m`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, if `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In all cases, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
