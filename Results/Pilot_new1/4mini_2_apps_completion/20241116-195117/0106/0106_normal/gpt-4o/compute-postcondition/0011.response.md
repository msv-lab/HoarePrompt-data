To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. `total_time` is assigned the value of `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`.
2. The variable `min_walk_time` is defined as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
3. The variable `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

Since we do not have specific values for `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `floor_b`, we cannot compute the exact value of `total_time`. However, we can summarize the relationships between these variables.

The output state reflects that `total_time` is dependent on the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.

Output State: **`total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, where `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`**.
