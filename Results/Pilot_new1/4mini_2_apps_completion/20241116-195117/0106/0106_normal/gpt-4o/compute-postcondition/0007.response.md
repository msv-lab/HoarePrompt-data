Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.**
