To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables.

1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned a value calculated using the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are determined by the `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)` functions, respectively. However, we do not have the specific values for `block_a` and `block_b`, so we will keep them as they are.
3. The variable `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000.

Since we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, we cannot compute a numerical value for `reverse_walk_time`. However, we can express the relationship and the states of the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000); `block_a` is determined by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` is determined by `get_location(b)`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
