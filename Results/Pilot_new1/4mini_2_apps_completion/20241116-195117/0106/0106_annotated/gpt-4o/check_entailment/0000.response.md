To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description while considering the annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Edward lives in apartment `a`, Natasha in apartment `b`.
- The building has `n` blocks (entrances), `m` floors per block, and `k` apartments per floor.
- The apartments are numbered sequentially.
- The time to move:
  - Up or down one floor by stairs: 5 seconds.
  - Moving between blocks (entrances): 15 seconds.
  - Elevator wait time: 10 seconds, and 1 second per floor moved.
- Edward can only exit from the first floor of his block.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - Computes the block and floor for a given apartment number.
   - The calculation seems correct based on the formulas provided in the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - Determines the time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha.
   - It calculates `time_to_exit` based on whether Edward is on the first floor or not.
   - It calculates the minimum walking time between blocks (both clockwise and counterclockwise).
   - It calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor after reaching her block.

### Annotations Review:
- The annotations describe the state of the program correctly after the main calculations.
- They confirm that the calculations for `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are handled as expected.

### Edge Cases:
- The program must correctly handle cases where:
  - Edward is already on the first floor (time to exit should be 0).
  - Edward and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors.
  - The scenario where the blocks wrap around (last block to the first).
  
### Potential Issues:
1. **Block Calculation**:
   - The calculation for `block` and `floor` in `get_location` assumes valid apartment numbers. However, if an invalid apartment number were passed (like 0 or negative), it wouldn't handle that properly. Although the problem guarantees valid apartment numbers, the function itself could be more robust.

2. **Walking Time Calculation**:
   - The calculation for `min_walk_time` does not account for the case when Edward needs to go to the block on the opposite side of the building, especially if `block_a` is less than `block_b` and vice versa. This could lead to incorrect walking time calculations if not properly wrapped around.

3. **Edge Case of Same Block**:
   - If both Edward and Natasha are in the same block but on different floors, the program correctly calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor, but it may not optimize for situations where it would be quicker to use the elevator instead of stairs.

### Conclusion:
While the code generally follows the problem description, it does not handle edge cases robustly, particularly with block transitions and invalid inputs. Given these considerations, the program may not work correctly for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

For example, if `a` is 1 and `b` is 2, the program should quickly determine that both apartments are in the same block but on different floors, yet it may not account for using the elevator effectively, potentially leading to longer than necessary travel time.
