The value of `a_floor` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and the previous values of other variables are not directly affected by this operation. The calculation of `a_floor` will depend on the specific values of `a` and `m` provided as input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `a_floor` based on the distinct integer values of `a` and `m`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to new input values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range 1 to n·m·k; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1.**
