The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided through `input()`, which is split into three integers and mapped to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified but are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, they will be updated to the new input values. The variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to new input values; `a` and `b` remain distinct integers within the range 1 to n·m·k**.
