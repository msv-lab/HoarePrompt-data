Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1 while `assigned` still contains the first `m` elements of `a`, `i` remains 1, and `x` is the last element of `assigned`. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `assigned`, `i`, and `x` are retained as they were before the execution of the if statement.***
