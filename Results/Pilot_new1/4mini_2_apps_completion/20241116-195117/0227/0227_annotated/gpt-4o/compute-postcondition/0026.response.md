The value of `can_form` is assigned `False`, which means it is explicitly set to `False`. The initial state indicates that `assigned` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is `False`, and since `can_form` is now `False`, `m` will be incremented by 1. The values of `i`, `x`, and `n` are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `assigned` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` remains unchanged, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, `n` is greater than 2**
