Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts and returns the number of elements in `a` that could not be formed by the difference of any two previously considered elements. If `n` is 1, it returns 1, as there are no previous elements to form from. The function ensures that the list `a` is sorted before processing. **
