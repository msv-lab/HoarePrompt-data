Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that element is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. `assigned` contains the first `m` elements of `a`, where `m` is the number of iterations executed (up to `n-1`), `i` is still 1, and `x` is the last element of `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. Edge cases include ensuring that `a[i]` is always greater than `x` for valid comparisons and handling scenarios where `assigned` may not contain sufficient elements to form a valid difference.**
