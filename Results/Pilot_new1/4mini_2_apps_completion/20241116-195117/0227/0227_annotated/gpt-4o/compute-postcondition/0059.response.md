The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, `m` stays the same, `i` is 3, `assigned` has at least 4 elements, `x` is the fourth element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
