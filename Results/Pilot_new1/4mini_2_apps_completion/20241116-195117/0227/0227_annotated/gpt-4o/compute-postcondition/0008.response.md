The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`. Other variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while maintaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.**
