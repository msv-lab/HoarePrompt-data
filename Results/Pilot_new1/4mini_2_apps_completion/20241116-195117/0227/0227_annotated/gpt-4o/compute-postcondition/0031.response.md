Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[i] - x` is found in the list `assigned`, indicating that a valid combination has been formed. The variable `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, and `n` is greater than 2. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `can_form` still being False.***
