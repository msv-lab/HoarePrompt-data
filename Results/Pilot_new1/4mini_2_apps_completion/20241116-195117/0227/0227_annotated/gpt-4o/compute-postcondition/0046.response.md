According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and iterates while `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2. After the current iteration, `i` will increment to 3 in the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `i` will become 3 at the start of the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `can_form` and `assigned` are unchanged.

State: **`can_form` is False, m is unchanged, `i` is 3, `assigned` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than 2**
