According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i < n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at some value, which is less than `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, if `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration. 

Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.

The state also mentions that `assigned` now includes the value `a[i]`, which means that `a[k]` has been added to `assigned`. 

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to `k + 1` and ensure that `n` is greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` includes the value `a[k]`, `i` is k + 1, `n` is greater than k + 1**
