Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating a valid formation is possible, and we exit the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains undefined, and the program continues without any additional changes to the variables.***
