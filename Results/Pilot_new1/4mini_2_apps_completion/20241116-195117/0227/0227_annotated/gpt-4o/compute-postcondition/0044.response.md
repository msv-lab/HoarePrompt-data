Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, `i` remains 2, and no changes are made to the values of other variables. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 2. Additionally, if `assigned` is empty or `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, leaving `can_form` as False, `m` unchanged, and `i` still at 2.***
