Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, `assigned` contains the first `m` elements of `a`, where `m` is the number of iterations executed (up to `n-1`), `i` is still 1, and `x` is the last element of `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute. If `assigned` is not empty, it must be that there are no elements in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and any element in `assigned` is also in `assigned`. Additionally, `a[i]` is greater than `x` for valid comparisons.***
