According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from 1 to `n - 1`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the next iteration will check if `i` can be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we need to ensure that `i` can be increased to 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 3. Therefore, we do not need to change the value of `n`, since it is already greater than or equal to 2, which allows for at least one more iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 3**
