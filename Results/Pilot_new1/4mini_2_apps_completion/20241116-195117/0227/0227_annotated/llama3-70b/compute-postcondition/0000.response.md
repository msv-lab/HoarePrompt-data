The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The state of the list `a` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` remains a list of n distinct positive integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers**
