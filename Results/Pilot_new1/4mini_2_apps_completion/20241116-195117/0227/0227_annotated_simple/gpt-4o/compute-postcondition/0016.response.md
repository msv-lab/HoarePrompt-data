The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables: `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the third element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**.
