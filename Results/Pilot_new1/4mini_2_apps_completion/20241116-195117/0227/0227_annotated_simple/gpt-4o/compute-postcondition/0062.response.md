Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` exists, `can_form` remains False. `m` is an integer greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False, with `m` and `i` unchanged.**
