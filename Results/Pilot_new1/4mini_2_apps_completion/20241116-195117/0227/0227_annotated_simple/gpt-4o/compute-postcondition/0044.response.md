Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, `m` is an integer increased by 1 from its initial value, `assigned` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to `n`, and `x` remains undefined. If the loop did not execute due to `assigned` being empty or `i` being out of bounds for array `a`, `can_form` remains False and `m` is still increased by 1.***
