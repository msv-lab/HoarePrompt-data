The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, changing its previous value of `False`. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while keeping the rest of the variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and `x` is contained in `assigned`.**
