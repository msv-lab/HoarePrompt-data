The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements, followed by a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list `a` are not double the preceding element, starting from 1. Finally, it prints the count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, the count will always be 1 since there are no preceding elements to compare.
