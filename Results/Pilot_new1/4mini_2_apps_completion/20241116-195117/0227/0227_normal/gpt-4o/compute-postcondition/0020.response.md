Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` remains False. The loop will execute once for each element in `assigned`, and if `assigned` is empty or contains only one element, the loop will not execute, leaving `can_form` as False.**
