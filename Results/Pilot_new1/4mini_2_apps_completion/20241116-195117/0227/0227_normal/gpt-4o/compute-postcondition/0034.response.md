The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` is a list with at least 2 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
