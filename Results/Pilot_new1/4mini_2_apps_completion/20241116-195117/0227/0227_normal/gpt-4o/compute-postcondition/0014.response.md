Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
