Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, where `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` includes at least two elements, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. If this condition holds, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition does not hold, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
