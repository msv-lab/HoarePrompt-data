The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` includes at least two elements, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
