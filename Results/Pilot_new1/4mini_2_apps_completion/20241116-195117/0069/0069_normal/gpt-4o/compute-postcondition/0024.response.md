The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The state of the other variables, including `prefix_balances` and `balance`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `results` now contains an additional element, which is `0`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the number of '0's and '1's are equal up to the current point in the string, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains an additional element, which is 0.**
