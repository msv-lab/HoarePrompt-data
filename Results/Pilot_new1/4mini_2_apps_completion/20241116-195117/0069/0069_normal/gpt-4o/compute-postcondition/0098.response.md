The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The `prefix_balances` list remains unchanged, and the values of `T`, `index`, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones up to index `n`, `results` has an additional element `0`, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`.**
