According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is unchanged. Since `i` is now greater than `n`, the loop cannot execute again without adjustments.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted back to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now equal to `n`.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and the character `s[n]`, `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged**
