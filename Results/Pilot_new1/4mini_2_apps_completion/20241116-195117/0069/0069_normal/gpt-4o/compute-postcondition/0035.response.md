According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `prefix_balances` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, and `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements, and `b` should be updated to the third element of `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 3, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`.**
