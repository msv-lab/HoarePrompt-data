The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `data`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `results`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `data` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 4, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `data` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 4, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, and `results` is an empty list**
