Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 3, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, then `count` remains unchanged.***
