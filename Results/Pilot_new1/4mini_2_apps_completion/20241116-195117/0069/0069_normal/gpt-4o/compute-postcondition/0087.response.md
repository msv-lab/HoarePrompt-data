Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`; `results` is unchanged; `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations; `index` is increased by 3; `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`.**
