According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has a length of at least 3 and `b` is the third element of that list. 

To execute one more time, we need to consider that `b` should now refer to the fourth element of `prefix_balances`, and the list must have at least 4 elements. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `prefix_balances` needs to have a length of at least 4.
- `b` should be the fourth element of `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 4, `b` is the fourth element of `prefix_balances`**
