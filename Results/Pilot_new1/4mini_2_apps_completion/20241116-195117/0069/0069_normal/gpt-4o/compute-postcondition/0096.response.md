The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` is updated to include `-1`, `T` is still greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is still increased by 3, `balance` remains equal to 0, and `x` is still an element in `prefix_balances`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new state of `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones up to index `n`, `results` is updated to include -1, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`.**
