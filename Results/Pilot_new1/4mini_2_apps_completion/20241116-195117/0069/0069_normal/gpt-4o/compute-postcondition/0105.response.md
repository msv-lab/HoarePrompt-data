Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
