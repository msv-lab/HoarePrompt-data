Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where the balance is equal to 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`; otherwise, `0` is appended. If the balance is not zero, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
