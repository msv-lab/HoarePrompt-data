The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 1, so the expression `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[2]`. The value of `data[2]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `x`. The previous values of `T`, `data`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `x`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `data` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `results` is an empty list**
