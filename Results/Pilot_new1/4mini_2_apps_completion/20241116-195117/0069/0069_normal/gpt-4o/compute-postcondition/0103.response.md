Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `x` is such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`***
