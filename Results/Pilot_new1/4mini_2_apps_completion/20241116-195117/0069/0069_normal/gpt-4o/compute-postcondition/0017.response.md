The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character `s[i - 1]`. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` evaluates to either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is `'0'` or not. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, so `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[n] + (1 if s[n] == '0' else -1)`. The state of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and the character `s[n]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
