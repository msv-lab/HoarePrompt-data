Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. Otherwise, if `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program's behavior is undefined unless `x` also equals `balance`, in which case the output is not specified, potentially leading to an error state.***
