Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer in the range (-10^9, 10^9), `s` is a user-provided binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, it is not the case that `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, meaning that either `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` or `x - balance` is not a multiple of `(cnt0 - cnt1)` if `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`.***
