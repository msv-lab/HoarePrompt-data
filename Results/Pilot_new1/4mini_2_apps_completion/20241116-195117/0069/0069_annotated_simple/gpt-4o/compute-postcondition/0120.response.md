According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `results` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is not empty, which means there is at least one more element to process. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the next `result` will be the next element in the `results` list. Since we do not have information about how many elements are in `results` or which one was processed last, we can only state that there must be at least one more `result` available.

Thus, we need to say that `results` has at least one more element than before, and we should also reflect that the next `result` will be the subsequent element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `results` has at least one more element, `balance` is either 0 or a non-zero value that leads to a non-empty `results`, and the next `result` is the subsequent element in the `results` list.**
