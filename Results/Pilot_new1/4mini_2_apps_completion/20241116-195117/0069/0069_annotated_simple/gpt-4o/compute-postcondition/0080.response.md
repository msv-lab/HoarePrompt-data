The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` retrieves an element from the `data` list and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `T` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `prefix_balances` and `T`, along with the newly assigned value of `n`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `T` is greater than `_`, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])**
