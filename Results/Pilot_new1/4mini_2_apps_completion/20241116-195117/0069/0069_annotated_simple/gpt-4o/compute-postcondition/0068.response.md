Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0 initially. If the value of `x` minus `b` is divisible by `balance` with a non-negative quotient, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, `count` remains 0.***
