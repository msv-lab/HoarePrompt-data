According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and the loop will increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `n + 1`.

The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is determined by the expression `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, but since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to adjust the `prefix_balances` or `s` values at this point.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is `prefix_balances[n] + (1 if s[n - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
