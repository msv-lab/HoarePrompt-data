The code assigns a new value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character in the string `s` at index `i - 1`. Given that `i` is `n + 1`, we need to check the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]` to determine the new value for `prefix_balances[i]`. 

The operation adds `1` to `prefix_balances[i - 1]` if `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, or subtracts `1` if `s[i - 1]` is not `'0'`. 

Since we do not have the specific values for `prefix_balances[i - 1]` or `s[i - 1]`, we can only describe the change in general terms. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`**
