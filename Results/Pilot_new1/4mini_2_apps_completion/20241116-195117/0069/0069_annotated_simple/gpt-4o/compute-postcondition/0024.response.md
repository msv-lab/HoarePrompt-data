The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state of `prefix_balances` is not affected, and the variable `balance` remains `0`. The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, and `results` now includes an additional `0`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, and `results` now includes an additional `0`**
