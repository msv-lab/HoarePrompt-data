The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `count` will be 3. The values of `prefix_balances` and `balance` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is now 3.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is now 3**
