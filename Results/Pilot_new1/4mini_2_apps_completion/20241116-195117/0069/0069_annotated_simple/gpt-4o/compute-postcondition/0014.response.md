According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be at least 2 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `index` is increased by 3, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is updated at index 1 to either 1 or -1, `i` is 2**
