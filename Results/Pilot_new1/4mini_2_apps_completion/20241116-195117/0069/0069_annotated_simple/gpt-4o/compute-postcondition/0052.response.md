The code updates the `prefix_balances` list at index `i` based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known (from the initial state, it's 0 for the first index) and will be adjusted by either adding 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '0') or subtracting 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '1'). The value of `prefix_balances[i]` will depend on the specific character at `s[i - 1]`. 

- If `s[i - 1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` becomes `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`.
- If `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `prefix_balances[i]` becomes `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1`.

Given that `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`, the impact of this code will be reflected in the next index of the `prefix_balances` list.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.**
