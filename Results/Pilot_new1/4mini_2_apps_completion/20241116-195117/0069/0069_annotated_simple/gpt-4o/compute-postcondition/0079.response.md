According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `T`. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than the current iteration count (which is `_` in this case). Since we do not have the exact value of `_`, we can only state that `T` needs to be greater than `_`.

Since there are no other states mentioned that would affect the loop execution, we only need to adjust the state of `T`. Therefore, the state should indicate that `T` is greater than the current iteration count.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `T` is greater than `_`**
