According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is not specified but is known to be at least 1 since the loop starts from 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop has executed for `i`, it means `i` is currently equal to `n` (the maximum value for `i` in the range). 

To allow the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to `n + 1`. Additionally, since the loop updates `prefix_balances[i]`, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances[i]` is prepared for the next iteration, which means it should be updated based on `prefix_balances[1]` and the value of `s[1]`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be set to `n + 1`.
- `prefix_balances[i]` should be updated based on `prefix_balances[1]` and the value of `s[1]`.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[1]` and the value of `s[1]`, `i` is `n + 1`**
