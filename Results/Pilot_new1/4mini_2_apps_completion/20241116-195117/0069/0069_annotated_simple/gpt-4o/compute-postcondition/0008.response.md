The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 2` equals 3. Therefore, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`. The initial values of `T`, `n`, `results`, and `x` are not affected by this assignment. The output state reflects the assignment of `s`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]**.
