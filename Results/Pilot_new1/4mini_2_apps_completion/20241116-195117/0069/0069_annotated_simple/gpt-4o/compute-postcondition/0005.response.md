According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be at least 1. The values of `n`, `x`, `index`, and `results` do not affect the execution of the loop directly in this context. Since `index` starts at 1, it is already set correctly for the first iteration of the loop, and `results` being an empty list does not impact the loop execution.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `T` needs to be greater than or equal to 1. 

State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
