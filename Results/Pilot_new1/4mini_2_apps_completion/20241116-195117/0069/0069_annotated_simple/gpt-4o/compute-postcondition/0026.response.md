Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s` up to each index from 1 to `n`, and the variable `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is updated based on the values in `s`, otherwise it remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.***
