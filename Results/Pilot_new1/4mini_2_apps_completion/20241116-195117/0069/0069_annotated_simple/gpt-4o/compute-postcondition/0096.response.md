The code appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The previous state of `prefix_balances` is not affected by this operation, and the value of `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, the last value of `prefix_balances` is 0, `x` is one of the elements in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1.**
