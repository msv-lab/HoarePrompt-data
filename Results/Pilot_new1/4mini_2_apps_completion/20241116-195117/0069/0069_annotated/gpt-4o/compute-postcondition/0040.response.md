The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is derived from the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the given conditions. Since the loop does not execute under the mentioned conditions, `count` retains its value. The states of `prefix_balances` and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, `prefix_balances` retains its original size of `n + 1`, and `balance` remains not equal to 0.

Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, `prefix_balances` retains its original size of `n + 1`, and `balance` remains not equal to 0.**
