Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros. If `balance` equals 0, and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1; if `x` is not found, 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` contains this `count`. In all cases, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains all zeros and the loop does not execute.***
