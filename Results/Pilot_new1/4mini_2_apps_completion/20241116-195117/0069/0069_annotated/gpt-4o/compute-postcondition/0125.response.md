Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for each element in `results`, printing each `result` which is an element from `results`. `prefix_balances` is a list of size greater than 1. If `n` is 0 or if `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, `results` remains empty, and `prefix_balances` is a list with a single element [0].**
