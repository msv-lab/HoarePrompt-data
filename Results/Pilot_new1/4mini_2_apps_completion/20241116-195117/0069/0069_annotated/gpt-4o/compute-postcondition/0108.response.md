Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size at least 2 initialized with zeros, `n` is at least 1, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, `count` remains unchanged.***
