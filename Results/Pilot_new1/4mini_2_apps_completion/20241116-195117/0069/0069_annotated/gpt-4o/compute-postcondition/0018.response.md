According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, it must be adjusted to `n` or lower. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `n` for the loop to execute again. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n` remains valid (at least 1).

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and `s[n - 1]`, where `i` is n, and `n` is at least 1**
