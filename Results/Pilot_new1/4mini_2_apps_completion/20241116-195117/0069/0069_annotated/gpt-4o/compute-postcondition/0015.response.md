The code assigns a new value to `prefix_balances[i]`, which is calculated based on the previous value in the `prefix_balances` list and the character at position `i - 1` in the string `s`. The value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known, and the character `s[i - 1]` can either be '0' or '1', which affects the calculation.

Given that `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 based on `s[0]`, we can calculate `prefix_balances[i]` as follows:

- If `s[i - 1]` is '0', then we add 1 to `prefix_balances[i - 1]`.
- If `s[i - 1]` is '1', then we subtract 1 from `prefix_balances[i - 1]`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on these calculations.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`**
