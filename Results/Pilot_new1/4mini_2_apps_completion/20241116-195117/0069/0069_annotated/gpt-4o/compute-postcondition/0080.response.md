The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` is expected to be a string that can be converted to an integer. The previous values of the affected variables are not explicitly provided, but `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, and `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `n`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with cumulative balances based on string `s`, `balance` is determined by these balances, `results` contains the previous values, `T` is greater than 0, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])**
