The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, which consists of two integers separated by a space. The initial state indicates that `T` is a positive integer (within the range of 1 to 100) and `_` is 0. The values of `n` and `x` will depend on the input provided and are not predetermined. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `x` are now assigned input values, while `T` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0, `n` and `x` are input integers**
