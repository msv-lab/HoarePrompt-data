Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that division by zero is avoided when `cnt0` equals `cnt1` (in which case the first condition would hold true).***
