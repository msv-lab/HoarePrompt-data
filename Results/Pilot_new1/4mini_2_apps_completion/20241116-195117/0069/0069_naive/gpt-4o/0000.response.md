To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to calculate the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` (constructed by repeating the string `s`) that have a balance equal to `x`.
2. The balance of a string is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's.
3. If the balance of `s` is zero and `x` can be achieved as a prefix balance, the answer should be `-1` (indicating infinite prefixes).
4. If the balance of `s` is non-zero, we need to check how many prefixes can achieve the desired balance.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads multiple test cases and processes them in a loop.
2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: It calculates the balance of the string `s` and the prefix balances.
3. **Infinite Check**: It checks if the balance of `s` is zero and if `x` is among the prefix balances.
4. **Count Valid Prefixes**: If the balance is non-zero, it counts how many times the desired balance can be achieved using the formula `(x - b) % balance == 0`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Single Character Strings**: For `s = "0"` and `x = 0`, the program should return `1`, which it does. However, for `s = "1"` and `x = 0`, it should return `0`, which it also does.
- **Balance Zero with Achievable Prefix**: If `s = "0101"` and `x = 0`, the program should return `-1` (infinite) since the balance of `s` is zero and `0` is in the prefix balances.
- **Negative Balance**: If `s = "111"` and `x = -1`, this should yield `0` since there are no valid prefixes that can achieve that balance.

### Problematic Cases:
- The program does not handle cases where the input `s` has a length of `1` correctly, especially when `x` is outside the bounds of what can be achieved.
- The logic for counting valid prefixes might not cover all scenarios, particularly when `x` is not achievable through the balance of `s` and the prefix balances.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and potential edge cases, I found that the program may not correctly handle certain edge cases where the balance of `s` is zero and `x` is not achievable through the prefix balances. This indicates that the program might not behave as expected for all inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to correctly handle cases where `x` is not achievable from the prefix balances when the balance of `s` is zero, leading to incorrect results.
