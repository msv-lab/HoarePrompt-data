The function accepts an integer input `n` followed by a string `fractions` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string, it defaults to printing 'R' since both counts would be zero. The function does not return any value.
