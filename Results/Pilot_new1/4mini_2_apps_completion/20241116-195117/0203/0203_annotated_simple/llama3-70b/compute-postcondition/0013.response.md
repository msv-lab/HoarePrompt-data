Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `fraction` is the next character in the string. If `fraction` equals 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 (resulting in either 1 or 2), while `remocrats` remains either 0 or 1. If `fraction` equals 'R', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 (resulting in either 1 or 2), while `depublicans` remains either 0 or 1.***
