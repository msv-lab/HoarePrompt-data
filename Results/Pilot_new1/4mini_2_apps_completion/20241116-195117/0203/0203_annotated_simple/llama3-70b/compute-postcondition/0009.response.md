Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', if `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 while `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is 'R', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 while `depublicans` remains 0.***
