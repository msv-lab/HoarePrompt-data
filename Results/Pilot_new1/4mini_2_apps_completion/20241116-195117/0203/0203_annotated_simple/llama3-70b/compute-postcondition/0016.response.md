The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `remocrats` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, after the execution, if `remocrats` was initially 0, it becomes 1, and if it was initially 1, it becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `remocrats`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 1 or 2, `remocrats` is either 1 or 2**
