The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` can either be 0 or 1. Therefore, after execution, `remocrats` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, `fraction`, and `depublicans`) remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1, `remocrats` is either 1 or 2**
