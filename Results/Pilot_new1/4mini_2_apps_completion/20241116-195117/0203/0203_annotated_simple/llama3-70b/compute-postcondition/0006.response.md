The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and `fraction` is 'D'.
