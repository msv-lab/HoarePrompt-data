The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element and `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`. However, this operation does not affect `d_queue` or `d_index`. The only change is that `r_queue` loses its first element, and `r_index` now holds that value. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation**
