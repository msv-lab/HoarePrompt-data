To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions governing the `while` loop.

The loop will continue executing as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. 

1. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `d_queue` has one less element and `r_queue` is unchanged.
2. Since `d_queue` had one less element, it is crucial to ensure that it still contains elements for the loop to execute again.
3. The loop will also not execute if `r_queue` is empty.

Given that `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, we need to ensure that `d_queue` still has elements left. Therefore, we can infer that the initial state of `d_queue` must have been at least 2 elements before the last iteration (to account for the one element that was removed). 

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `d_queue` to reflect that it still has elements remaining. Thus, we can state that `d_queue` currently has at least 1 element left. 

Since there are no other states that need to be adjusted for the loop condition to hold true, we can summarize the necessary state.

State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element, `r_queue` is not empty**
