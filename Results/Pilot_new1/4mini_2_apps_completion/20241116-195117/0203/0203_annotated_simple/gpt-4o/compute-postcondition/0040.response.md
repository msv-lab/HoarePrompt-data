Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, it means all 'D' votes have been processed against non-'D' votes, and `r_queue` will contain the remaining non-'D' votes with their indices incremented by `n` for each corresponding 'D' vote processed. If `r_queue` is empty, all non-'D' votes have been processed against 'D' votes, and `d_queue` will contain the remaining 'D' votes with their indices incremented by `n`. If either queue is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged.**
