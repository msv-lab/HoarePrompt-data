The operation appends `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` is known from the initial state, and `n` is an unspecified integer. The other variables, `d_queue` and `d_index`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue` while indicating the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_queue` now has `r_index + n` appended.**
