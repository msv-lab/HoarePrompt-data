Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes `n` times, processing each character in `votes` and updating the queues accordingly.**
