The code appends `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The values of `r_index` and `n` are used to calculate the new element to be added. The previous state of `r_queue` is one element less than before, but now it will have an additional element after the execution. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one element more than before, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`, and the new element `r_index + n` has been added to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one element more than before, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`, and the new element `r_index + n` has been added to `r_queue`.**
