The code appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `d_index` is an element from `d_queue`, and `d_queue` has one less element, but this does not directly affect `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is not specified, nor is the value of `n`, but the operation will result in `r_queue` having one additional element.

Since the specific values of `r_index` and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value being appended to `r_queue`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `r_queue` but will remain general regarding the values.

Output State: **`d_index` is an element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, and `r_queue` now has one additional element with the value `r_index + n` appended.**
