The code appends the value `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_index` and `n` are needed to determine the new state of `d_queue`. The other variables (`r_queue` and `r_index`) are not affected by this operation.

Since `d_queue` had one less element before this operation, it will now have one more element after appending. The value of the first element in `d_queue` (`d_index`) is used in the calculation, and `n` is added to it to determine the new value that will be appended.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (`d_index + n` appended), `r_queue` is one element less than before, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`**.
