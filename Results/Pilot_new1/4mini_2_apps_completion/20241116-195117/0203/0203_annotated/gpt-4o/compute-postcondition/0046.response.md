The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' only, representing the fractions of the employees. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters and processes these inputs to return a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string.**
