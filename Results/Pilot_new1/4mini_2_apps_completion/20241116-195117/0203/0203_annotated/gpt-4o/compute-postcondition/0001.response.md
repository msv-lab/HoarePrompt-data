The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The length of `votes` will be equal to `n` since `votes` is defined to be a string of length `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' only after input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' only after input.**
