The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `d_queue`. The variable `d_queue` is affected by this operation, but the values of `n`, `votes`, and `v` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `votes`, and `v`, along with the new state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; and `d_queue` now includes the value 2.**
