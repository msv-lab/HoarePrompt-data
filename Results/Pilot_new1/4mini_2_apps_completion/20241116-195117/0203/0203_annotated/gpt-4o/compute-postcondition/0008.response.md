The code `r_queue.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. Given that `i` is 0, the value appended to `r_queue` will be 0. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 0; `v` is not 'D'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` contains 0.
