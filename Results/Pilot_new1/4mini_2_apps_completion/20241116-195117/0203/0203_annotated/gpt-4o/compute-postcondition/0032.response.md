Postcondition: ***`d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, which now has one additional element `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` has one less element or one additional element added, with `r_index` being the first element removed, and `r_queue` now contains `r_index + n`. In either case, `d_queue` has one less element than before, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` reflect the appropriate updates based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`.***
