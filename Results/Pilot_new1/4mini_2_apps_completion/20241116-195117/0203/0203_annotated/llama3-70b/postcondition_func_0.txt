The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R'. If the count of 'D' is less than or equal to the count of 'R', it prints 'R'. If the input string `fractions` is empty, both counts will be zero, resulting in the output 'R'.
