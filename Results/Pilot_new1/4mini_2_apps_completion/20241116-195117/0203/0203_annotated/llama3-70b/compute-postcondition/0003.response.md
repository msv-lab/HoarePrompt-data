The variable `remocrats` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables `n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
