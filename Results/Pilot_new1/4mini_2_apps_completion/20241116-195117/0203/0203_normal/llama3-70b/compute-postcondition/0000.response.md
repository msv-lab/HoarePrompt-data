The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `fractions` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer and `fractions` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
