Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, and `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D'. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed. If the length of `fractions` is 0, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and no characters are printed.***
