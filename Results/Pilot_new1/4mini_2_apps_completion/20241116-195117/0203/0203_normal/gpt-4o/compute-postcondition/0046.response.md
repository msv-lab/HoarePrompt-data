The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \). The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the characters in the `votes` string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a value based on the content of the `votes` string.**
