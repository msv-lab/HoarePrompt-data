Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `i + 1`. If the character at index `i` in `votes` (denoted as `v`) is 'D', then `i` is appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, if `v` is not 'D' (which can include 'R' or any other character), `i` is appended to `r_queue`. This ensures that all indices corresponding to 'D' votes are collected in `d_queue`, while all other votes are collected in `r_queue`. Additionally, edge cases such as `i` being at the last index of `votes` or the character at index `i` being neither 'D' nor 'R' are accounted for in the respective queues.***
