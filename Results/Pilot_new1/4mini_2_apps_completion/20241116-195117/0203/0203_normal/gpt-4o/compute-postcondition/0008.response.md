The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `r_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is [0], `i` is 0, and `v` is 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is [0], `i` is 0, and `v` is 'R'**
