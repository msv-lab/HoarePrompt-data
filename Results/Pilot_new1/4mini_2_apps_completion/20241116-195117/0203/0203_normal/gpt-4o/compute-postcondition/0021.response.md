The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes and returns the first element of `r_queue`, assigning it to `r_index`. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged, while `r_queue` will have its first element removed. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated state of `r_queue` and the newly assigned value of `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` with the first index removed; `r_queue` has its first element removed and `r_index` is assigned the value of that removed element.**
