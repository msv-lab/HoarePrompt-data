The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it takes input from the user, removes any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns that cleaned string to `votes`. The initial state indicates that `votes` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but the specific content of `votes` will depend on the user's input. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R', based on user input.**
