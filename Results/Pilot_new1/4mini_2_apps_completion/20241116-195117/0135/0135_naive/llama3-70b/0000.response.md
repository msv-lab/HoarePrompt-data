Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case when `k` is greater than `n`. For example, if we take `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the program will compute the remainders as follows:

- `3 % 1 = 0`
- `3 % 2 = 1`
- `3 % 3 = 0`
- `3 % 4 = 3`
- `3 % 5 = 3`

Here, the remainders `0` is repeated for `i = 1` and `i = 3`, thus the output should be "No". However, if `k` is greater than `n`, the program does not correctly account for the fact that remainders can repeat due to the properties of modulo operation. 

Additionally, the program also fails to handle the case where `k` is equal to `n`, where the remainders can still repeat.

For example:
- Input: `n = 6`, `k = 6`
- Remainders would be: `6 % 1 = 0`, `6 % 2 = 0`, `6 % 3 = 0`, `6 % 4 = 2`, `6 % 5 = 1`, `6 % 6 = 0`
- The output should be "No" because `0` appears multiple times.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
