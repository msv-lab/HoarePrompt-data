The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).
  
- In Case 2, if `k` is at least 1, the function checks the unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, the loop completes without returning 'No'.

- In Case 3, if the conditions of the previous cases are not met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the values of `k` in relation to `n`, it returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainders are repeated; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than `n`, it does not return anything. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k. It returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, or if any remainders of n when divided by integers from 1 to k are repeated. If k is less than n, it returns None. If all conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.**
