The variable `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. Since `remainder` is the result of `n % 3`, and it can either be 0, 1, or 2, we need to consider whether `remainder` is already in `seen`. Given that `seen` includes 0 and potentially 1, if `remainder` is either 0 or 1, it would already be present in `seen`, and the program would have printed 'No' and exited before reaching this point. Therefore, we can conclude that `remainder` must be 2, allowing the program to continue.

After executing the code, `remainder` (which is 2) is added to `seen`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0, 1, and now 2, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is 2**.
