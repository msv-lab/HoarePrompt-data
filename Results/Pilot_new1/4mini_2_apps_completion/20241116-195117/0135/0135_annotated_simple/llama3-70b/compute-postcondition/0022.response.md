Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute k times, and `seen` will contain all unique remainders of n when divided by values from 1 to k. If any remainder is repeated, the output will be 'No' and the program will exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set.**
