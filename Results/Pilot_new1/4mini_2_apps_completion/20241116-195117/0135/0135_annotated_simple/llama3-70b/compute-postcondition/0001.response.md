The variable `seen` is assigned an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and `k` as input integers and indicates that `seen` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set**
