The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, `remainder`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates the current values of these variables and the printed result.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the output is 'No'**.
