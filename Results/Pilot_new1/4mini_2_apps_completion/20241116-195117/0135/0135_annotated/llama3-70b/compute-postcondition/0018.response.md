The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits before any further execution can occur. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % 3,` and the function prints 'No' before exiting.
