The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and since the case where `k` is less than `n` is not explicitly handled in the provided code, we do not have any other operations affecting the state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
