To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and compare it with the requirements stated.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to check if all the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. The output should be "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Immediate Return for `k >= n`:**
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns 'No'. This is correct because `n % n = 0` and `n % (n-1)` will also yield a repeat for certain values of `n`. Thus, if `k >= n`, we can guarantee that there will be duplicate remainders.

2. **Loop through `1` to `k`:**
   - For values of `k` less than `n`, the program calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by each integer from `1` to `k`. 
   - It uses a set `seen_remainders` to track previously encountered remainders. If a remainder is found that already exists in the set, it returns 'No', indicating duplicates.

3. **Final Return:**
   - If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the scenario where `k` is less than `1`. However, based on the constraints given (1 â‰¤ n, k), this case should not occur.

### Examples from the Problem Description:
- For input `4 4`, the program correctly returns 'No' because:
  - `4 % 1 = 0`
  - `4 % 2 = 0`
  - `4 % 3 = 1`
  - `4 % 4 = 0` (duplicate)
  
- For input `5 3`, the program correctly returns 'Yes' because:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - All remainders are distinct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles the provided examples accurately. The annotations provided in the comments align with the logic in the code, confirming that the program correctly identifies distinct remainders.

Therefore, based on the analysis and the examples provided, the program is correct for all potential cases described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
