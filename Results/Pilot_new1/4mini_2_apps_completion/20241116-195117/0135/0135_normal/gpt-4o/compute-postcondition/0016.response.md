The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return anything. If `k` is at least 1, the loop executes up to `k` times, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder has been seen before, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, it continues until completion.
- In Case 3, if all remainders are unique throughout the loop execution, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, return 'No' if any remainder is repeated during the calculations, and return 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returns 'No' if any remainder is repeated during calculations, and returns 'Yes' if all remainders are unique.**
