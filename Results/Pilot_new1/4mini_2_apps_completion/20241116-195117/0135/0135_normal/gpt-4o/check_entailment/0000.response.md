To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to check if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
```

1. **First Check**: The code first checks if `k >= n`. If this condition is true, it returns 'No'. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders will repeat (for example, `n mod n = 0` and `n mod (n-1)` will yield the same results for certain values of `n`).

2. **Looping through Remainders**: The function then initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` and iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`. For each integer `i`, it computes the remainder `n % i`. If this remainder has been seen before (exists in the set), it returns 'No'. If not, it adds the remainder to the set.

3. **Final Return**: If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when `k < 1`**: The code does not handle the case where `k` is less than `1`. According to the problem constraints, `k` should always be at least `1`, but if we consider the possibility of incorrect input, this situation could lead to an incorrect assumption that all remainders are distinct since the loop would not execute at all.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state:
- The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If `k` is less than `n`, it checks the remainders and returns 'No' if any remainder is repeated, otherwise 'Yes'.
- The hints correctly mention that the function does not handle the case where `k` is less than `1`, which could lead to unintended behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for the specified problem description for valid inputs. However, it fails to account for the edge case where `k < 1`. Since the problem description does not explicitly state that `k` will always be valid, this oversight means the program could potentially produce incorrect outputs in that scenario.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
