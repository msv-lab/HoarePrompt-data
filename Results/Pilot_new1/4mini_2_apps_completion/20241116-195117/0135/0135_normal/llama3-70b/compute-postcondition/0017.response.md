The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is now `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is now `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'**
