The code adds `remainder` to the set `seen`. Since `remainder` is already included in `seen`, the state of `seen` will now include `remainder` again, but the set will not change as it only contains unique values. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `seen` still includes `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `seen` still includes `remainder**
