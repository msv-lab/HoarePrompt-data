The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input and checks if the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and it directly prints 'Yes'.
