Example Answer:
The value at index 0 is popped from `r_queue` and assigned to `r_index`. The previous values of `r_index` and `r_queue` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1 with at least one character, `d_index` is updated to the next index popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, `r_queue` is modified.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1 with at least one character, `d_index` is updated to the next index popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, `r_queue` is modified**
