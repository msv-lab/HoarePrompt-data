Example Answer:
`d_queue` is appended with the value `d_index + n`, where `d_index` is updated to the next index popped from `d_queue`, and `n` is a positive integer. The states of `votes`, `r_index`, and `r_queue` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1 with at least one character, `d_index` is updated to the next index popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, `r_queue` is modified.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1 with at least one character, `d_index` is updated to the next index popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, `r_queue` is modified**
