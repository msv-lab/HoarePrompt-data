Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1 with at least one character, `d_index` is updated to the next index popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`, `r_queue` is modified. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_index` is appended to `d_queue` after adding `n` to it. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_index` is appended to `r_queue` after adding `n` to it. Additionally, if `r_index` is appended to `r_queue`, the sum of `r_index` and `n` is stored in `r_queue`.***
