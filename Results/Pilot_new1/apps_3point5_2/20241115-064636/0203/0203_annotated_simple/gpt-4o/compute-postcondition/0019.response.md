Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character. After the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in the `votes` string, and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` string, `d_queue` remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `r_queue` remains empty.**
