Postcondition: ***If both d_queue and r_queue are not empty, after the if else block executes, d_queue contains the updated indices of 'D' characters with the addition of n if d_index < r_index, and r_queue contains the updated indices of 'R' characters with the addition of n if r_index < d_index. If d_queue becomes empty before r_queue, then d_queue remains empty and r_queue contains the remaining indices of 'R' characters. If r_queue becomes empty before d_queue, then r_queue remains empty and d_queue contains the remaining indices of 'D' characters. If there are no 'D' characters in the votes string, d_queue remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the votes string, r_queue remains empty.***
