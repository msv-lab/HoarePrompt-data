Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `republicans` and `remocrats` are integers. If the next `fraction` is 'D', `republicans` is incremented by 1. If the next `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The fractions list is a list of at least 3 elements, and the next `fraction` is the third element in the list. After the execution of the if else block, the values of `republicans` and `remocrats` are updated based on the value of the next `fraction`. If the next `fraction` is 'D', `republicans` is incremented by 1. If the next `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The state of the program variables is consistent with the initial precondition, covering all potential edge cases.***
