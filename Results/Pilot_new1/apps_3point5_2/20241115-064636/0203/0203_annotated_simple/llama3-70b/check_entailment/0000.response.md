Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the number of depublicans and remocrats based on the input fractions. It then compares the counts and prints 'D' if depublicans have more votes, and 'R' if remocrats have more votes. The program follows the problem description and logic provided. Additionally, the program handles the case where the fractions list is empty, in which case both counts remain 0 and the output will be 'R'.
