According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list with at least 3 elements. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list with at least 4 elements**
