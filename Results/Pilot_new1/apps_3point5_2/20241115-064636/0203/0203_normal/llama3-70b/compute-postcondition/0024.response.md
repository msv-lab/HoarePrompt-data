Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list with at least 1 element. The loop will execute at least once. If the value of `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` will be incremented by 1 and `remocrats` will remain at 0. If the value of `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` will be incremented by 1 and `depublicans` will remain at 0. If `fractions` is an empty list, the loop will not execute and `depublicans` and `remocrats` will both remain at 0. Additionally, if `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, 'R' is printed.***
