The function reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `fractions` containing 'D's for depublicans and 'R's for remocrats. It then counts the occurrences of each fraction and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans than remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'. If the `fractions` list is empty, it will print 'R'.
