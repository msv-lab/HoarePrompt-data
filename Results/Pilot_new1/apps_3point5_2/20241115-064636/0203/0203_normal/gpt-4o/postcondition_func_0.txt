The function reads an integer n from input, followed by a string of votes. It then processes the votes to determine the majority party ('D' for Democrats or 'R' for Republicans) based on the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string. The function iterates through the votes, updating queues for 'D' and 'R' indices, and simulates a voting process by moving indices based on the value of n. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, indicating a majority of Democrat votes; otherwise, it prints 'R' for Republican majority.
