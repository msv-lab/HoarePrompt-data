Example Answer: 
The code initializes an empty list `r_queue`. The variables `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, votes contains n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R', d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, votes contains n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R', d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list**
