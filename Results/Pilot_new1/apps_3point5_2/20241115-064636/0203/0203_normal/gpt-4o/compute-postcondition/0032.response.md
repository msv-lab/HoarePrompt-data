Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices. `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`, `d_queue` or `r_queue` may have an additional element based on the conditions. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_index` is incremented by `n` and appended to `d_queue`. Otherwise, `r_index` is incremented by `n` and added to the `r_queue`.***
