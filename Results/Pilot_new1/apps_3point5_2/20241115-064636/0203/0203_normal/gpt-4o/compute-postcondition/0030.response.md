Example Answer:
`d_index` is incremented by `n` and then appended to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is known to be a positive integer, and `n` is also a positive integer. Therefore, the new value of `d_index` added to `d_queue` will be the previous value of `d_index` incremented by `n`. The states of other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` list has been iterated, `d_queue` and `r_queue` contain indices, `d_index` is the popped value from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`, `d_queue` or `r_queue` may have an additional element based on the conditions, `d_index` is incremented by `n` and appended to `d_queue`**
