Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `d_queue` is a list containing indices of characters with 'D', `r_queue` is a list containing indices of characters with 'R'. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` list, `d_queue` will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` list, `r_queue` will be empty. The loop will continue to execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. After each iteration, `d_index` will be assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` will be assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` will be appended with the value `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` will have an additional element which is `r_index + n`. The loop will handle all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct state of the queues and indices. The code snippet `print('R')` does not affect the state of the variables or queues.**
