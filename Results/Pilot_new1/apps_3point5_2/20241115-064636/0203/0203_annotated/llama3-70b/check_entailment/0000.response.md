Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply counts the number of depublicans and remocrats and then prints 'D' if there are more depublicans, and 'R' otherwise. However, the code does not simulate the voting process described in the problem statement where employees can deny others the right to vote until only one employee is left to determine the outcome.

An example where the code does not work as expected:
Input:
5
DDRRR

Expected Output:
D

Explanation:
According to the problem description, the voting process should eliminate employees from voting until only one is left. In this case, employee 1 denies employee 5 to vote, employee 2 denies employee 3 to vote, and then employee 4 denies employee 2 to vote. Thus, only employee 1 should be left to vote, resulting in 'D' winning. However, the code does not simulate this process and simply counts the number of depublicans and remocrats, leading to an incorrect output of 'R'.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully implement the voting process described in the problem statement.
