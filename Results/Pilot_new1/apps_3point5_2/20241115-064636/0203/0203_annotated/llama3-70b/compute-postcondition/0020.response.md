Postcondition: ***If fractions is not empty, the loop will iterate through each fraction and increment either depublicans or remocrats based on the value of the fraction. The final state will show the total count of depublicans and remocrats after processing all fractions. If fractions is empty, depublicans and remocrats will remain 0. In addition, depublicans is greater than remocrats.***
