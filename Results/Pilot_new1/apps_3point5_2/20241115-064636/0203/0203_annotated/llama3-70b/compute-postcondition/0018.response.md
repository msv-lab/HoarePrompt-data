According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If there are more fractions to process, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, fractions is assigned the input value and is not empty. If the last fraction processed was 'D', then depublicans is incremented by 1. If the last fraction processed was not 'D', then remocrats is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the fractions list must still have more fractions to process.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, fractions is assigned the input value and is not empty. If the last fraction processed was 'D', then depublicans is incremented by 1. If the last fraction processed was not 'D', then remocrats is incremented by 1.**
