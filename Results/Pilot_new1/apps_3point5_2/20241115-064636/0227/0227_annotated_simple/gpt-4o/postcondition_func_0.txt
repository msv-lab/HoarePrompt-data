The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and a. Parameter n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, while parameter a is a list of n distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function sorts list a, then iterates through the elements checking if the difference between the current element and any previous element exists in the assigned set. If not found, it increments m. The function returns the final value of m after the loop execution.
