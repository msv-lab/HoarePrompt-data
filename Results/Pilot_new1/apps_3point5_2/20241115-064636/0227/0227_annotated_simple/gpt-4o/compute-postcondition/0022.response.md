Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `x` iterates over each element in `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If there exists an element `a[i] - x` in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If such an element is not found for any `x`, `can_form` remains False and the program enters the if condition**
