Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `can_form` is True.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `can_form` is True**
