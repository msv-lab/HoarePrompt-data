Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
