Postcondition: ***`m`, `i+1`, `n`, `a`, `assigned âˆª {a[i]}`, `next_x` are elements in the assigned set, `x` is the next element in the `assigned` set. If `a[i] - x` is in the assigned set, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. This covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
