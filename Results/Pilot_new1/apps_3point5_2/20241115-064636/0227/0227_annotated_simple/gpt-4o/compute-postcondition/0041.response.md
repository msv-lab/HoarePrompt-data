Output State: **If there exists an element in `a` such that the difference between that element and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `assigned` contains the first `n` elements of `a`. `x` iterates over each element in `assigned`. `m` is incremented by 1. `i` is 2. `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute, and `can_form` will remain False.
