Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers in ascending order. It then iterates through the list to count the number of adjacent elements that are not in a ratio of 1:2, which determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. The final count `m` is printed, unless it exceeds 23, in which case -1 is printed. If `n` is 1, `m` remains 1.

The code annotations provide a clear explanation of what the program does and how the variable `m` is calculated based on the input sequence. The annotations also mention the edge case where `m` should be -1 if it exceeds 23. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified.
