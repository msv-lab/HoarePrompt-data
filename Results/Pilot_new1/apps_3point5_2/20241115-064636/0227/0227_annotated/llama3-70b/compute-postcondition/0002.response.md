Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, so after sorting, the order of elements in the list `a` is changed to be in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
