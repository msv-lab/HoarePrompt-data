Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23, a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**.
