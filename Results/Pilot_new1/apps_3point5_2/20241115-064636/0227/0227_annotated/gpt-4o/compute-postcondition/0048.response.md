According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in `assigned`. For the loop to execute, the variable `x` needs to be an element in `assigned`. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+3` to `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` are greater than 0, and there is no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`, `x` is an element in `assigned`**
