Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` are greater than 0. If there is a match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks, otherwise `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. All variables retain their initial values after the if else block executes.**
