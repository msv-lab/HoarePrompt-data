Output State: **`can_form` is a boolean value indicating whether a match was found in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+2` to `m+3` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+2` and `m+3` are greater than 0, and there is no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x`. In this case, `m` is incremented by 1. If `can_form` is True, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `assigned` is updated by adding `a[i]`.**
