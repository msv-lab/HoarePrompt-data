According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `can_form` is False, then `m` should be incremented by 1.
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the range.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean value, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` contains the first `m+3` to `m+4` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the next element in `assigned`, `m+3` and `m+4` are greater than 0, and there is no match in `assigned` for `a[i] - x**.
