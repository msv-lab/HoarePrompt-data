Output State: **The loop iterates through the list of distinct positive integers in ascending order to check if each element can be formed by adding two elements from the previously assigned elements. If a match is found, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If no match is found, `m` is incremented by 1, and the current element is added to `assigned`. The loop continues until all elements are processed. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute.**
