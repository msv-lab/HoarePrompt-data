According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the assigned list. If the assigned list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `can_form` is False, it does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is the first element in the list.
State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the list**
