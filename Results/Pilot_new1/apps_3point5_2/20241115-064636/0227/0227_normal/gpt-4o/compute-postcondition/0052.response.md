Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If there exists an index `i` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. The list `assigned` must have at least 1 element, and `x` must be the first element in the list. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False.***
