Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is found in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. The `assigned` list must have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element in the list. No changes occur if `a[i] - x` is not in the `assigned` list.***
