According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `assigned`, `a`, and `n`. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`, and the loop is terminated. If the difference is not present in `assigned`, `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, and `assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `assigned` must not be empty.
State: **If the loop is to execute one more time, `assigned` must not be empty**
