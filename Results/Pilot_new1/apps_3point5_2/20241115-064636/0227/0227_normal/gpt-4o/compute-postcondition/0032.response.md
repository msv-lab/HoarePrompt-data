According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements present in `assigned`. If there are more elements in `assigned`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop terminated, it means a new element was added to `assigned`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` should contain one more element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If the loop terminated, `assigned` contains one more element**
