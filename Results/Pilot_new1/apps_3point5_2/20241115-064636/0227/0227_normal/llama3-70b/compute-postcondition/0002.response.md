Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in increasing order. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order**
