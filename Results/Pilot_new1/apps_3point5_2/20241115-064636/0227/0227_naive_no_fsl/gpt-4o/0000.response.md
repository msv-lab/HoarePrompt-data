Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. The logic in the 'func_1' function does not accurately determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The program is not handling the operations as specified in the problem description.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3
3 6 5

Expected Output:
-1

Explanation:
For the input sequence [3, 6, 5], the program should output -1 as it is not possible to perform the described sequence of operations using any number of variables. However, the program may output an incorrect value for this input.
