Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It calculates the minimum number of variables by sorting the input sequence and checking if each element is double the previous element. If not, it increments the count of variables needed. The program handles all potential cases and correctly outputs the result.
