According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, so `i` should be incremented by 1. 
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
