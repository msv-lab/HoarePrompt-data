Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k >= n. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. After executing a loop that calculates unique remainders from `n % i` where i ranges from 1 to k, if any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If none of the 'No' conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.**
