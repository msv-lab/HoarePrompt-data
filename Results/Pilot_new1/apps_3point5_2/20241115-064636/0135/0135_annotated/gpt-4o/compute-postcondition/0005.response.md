Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and assigns it to the variable `remainder`. The initial state does not provide the values of `n` and `i`, so the output state is `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i**.
