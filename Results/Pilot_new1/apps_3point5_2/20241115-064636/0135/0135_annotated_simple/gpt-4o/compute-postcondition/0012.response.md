Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The value of `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1. The value of `n` remains the same. The set `seen_remainders` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n; `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the previous iteration + 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i**
