According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is greater than or equal to 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the condition k is greater than or equal to n needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. So, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k is greater than or equal to n.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to n, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
