Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the initial state variables. If the remainder is in seen_remainders at any point during the loop, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n and k remain the same as the initial state, seen_remainders contains unique remainders from n % i for i in the range 1 to k, i is the next integer after the last value of i in the previous iteration, and remainder is the result of n % i.**
