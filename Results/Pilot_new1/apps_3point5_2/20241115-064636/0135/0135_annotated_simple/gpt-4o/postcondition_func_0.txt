The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. 
If k is less than n, the function iterates through the range from 1 to k (inclusive), calculates the remainder of n divided by each value in the range, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.
