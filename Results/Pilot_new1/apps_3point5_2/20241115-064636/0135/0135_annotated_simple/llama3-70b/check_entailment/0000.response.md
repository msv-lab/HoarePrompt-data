Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. It then iterates over all integers from 1 to `k` and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are distinct, it prints 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works as expected.
