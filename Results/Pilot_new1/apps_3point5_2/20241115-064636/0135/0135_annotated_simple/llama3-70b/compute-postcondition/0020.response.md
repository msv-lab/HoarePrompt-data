Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. If `remainder` was already in `seen`, then the program would print 'No' and exit. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the updated values of `remainder`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the updated values of `remainder`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
