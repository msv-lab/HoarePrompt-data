According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder` after adding it to the set. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `i + 1`.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder` after adding it to the set, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
