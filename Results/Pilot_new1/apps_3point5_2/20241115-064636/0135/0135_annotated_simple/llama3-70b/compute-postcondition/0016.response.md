Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers. The value of `remainder` is dependent on the current values of `n` and `i`. The set `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the updated values of `remainder`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the updated values of `remainder`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
