Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No'. Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to k and calculates the remainder of dividing n by i. If any remainder is seen more than once, it returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a good summary of the functionality. Since the code handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
