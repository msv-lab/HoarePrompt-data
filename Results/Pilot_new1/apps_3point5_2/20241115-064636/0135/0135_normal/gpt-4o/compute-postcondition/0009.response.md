According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, and `i` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, i = 1, k ≥ 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, k ≥ 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`**
