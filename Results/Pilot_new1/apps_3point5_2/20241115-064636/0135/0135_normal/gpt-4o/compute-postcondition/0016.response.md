The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. 

Case 2: If 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, i is an integer between 1 and k, k ≥ 1, and remainder is the remainder of dividing n by i. If remainder is in the list of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute.

Case 3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers n and k, and based on the conditions described in the cases, return either 'No', 'Yes', or no change in the state of the variables n and k.
