According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is 4, k ≥ 1, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
