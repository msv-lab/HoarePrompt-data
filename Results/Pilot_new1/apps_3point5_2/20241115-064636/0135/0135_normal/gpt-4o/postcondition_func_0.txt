The function func_1 accepts two parameters n and k, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No'. 
Then, it iterates over the range from 1 to k and calculates the remainder of dividing n by i. If any remainder is seen more than once, it returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. 
If all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.
