According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i+1`, `seen`, `i` is 4, `remainder` are integers based on user input, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and the value of `remainder` is added to the `seen` set**
