Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the balance of the string $s$ and then determines the number of prefixes of $t$ with a balance equal to $x$ based on the given conditions in the problem description. It handles the case where there can be an infinite number of prefixes by checking if the difference between $x$ and the calculated balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of 0s and 1s in the string $s$. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
