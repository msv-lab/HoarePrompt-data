Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`. The previous values of `s` are unknown, so the output state is: T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input, `s` is assigned the input value, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`.
Output State: **T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input, `s` is assigned the input value, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
