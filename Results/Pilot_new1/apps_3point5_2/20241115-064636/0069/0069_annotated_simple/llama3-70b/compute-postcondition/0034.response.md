Postcondition: ***After the if else block executes, `T` is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the new input value, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are recalculated based on the new `s`, `balance` is recalculated based on the new `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed.***
