According to the code, the loop will execute T number of times. At the end of the last iteration, the values of `T`, `n`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` are already determined based on the input. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, you need to increment the value of `T` by 1.
State: **T is incremented by 1, all other variables remain unchanged**
