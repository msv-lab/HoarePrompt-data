Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 non-zero elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is increased by 1 if (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and the quotient is non-negative. The postcondition covers all edge cases related to the variables and their relationships after the execution of the if statement.***
