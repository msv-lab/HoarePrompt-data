Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and the count of '1's in the string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
