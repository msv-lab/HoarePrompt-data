Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is an integer. The value of `index` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`**
