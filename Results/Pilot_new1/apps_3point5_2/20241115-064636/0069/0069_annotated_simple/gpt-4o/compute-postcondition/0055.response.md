According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of the count operation, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
