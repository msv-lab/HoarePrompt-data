Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 for each '0' encountered in the string `s`, and -1 for each '1' encountered in `s`. If n is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. Additionally, when the if condition is met (balance == 0), the prefix_balances will be updated accordingly based on the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string `s`.***
