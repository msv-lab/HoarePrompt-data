According to the code, the loop will execute T times, where T is an integer. Before the loop starts, the list `data` should have at least T elements for the loop to execute. As the loop iterates, the `index` should be updated accordingly. At the start of each iteration, the `results` list should be empty.
State: **`data` is a list of strings with at least T elements, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
