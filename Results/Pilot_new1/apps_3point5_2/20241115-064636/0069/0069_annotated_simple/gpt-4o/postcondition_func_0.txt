The function `func_1` reads input data from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It calculates prefix sums based on the input string `s`, checks certain conditions, and appends values to the `results` list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value, as the results are printed directly. The loop iterates over the input data, updating variables accordingly, and prints the final results. However, the code may need additional error handling for edge cases like invalid input data or unexpected conditions.
