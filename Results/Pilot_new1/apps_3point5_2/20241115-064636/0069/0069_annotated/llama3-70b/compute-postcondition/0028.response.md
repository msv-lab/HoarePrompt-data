Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` respectively. The previous values of the affected variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` holds the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` holds the count of '1' characters in `s`.
Output State: **`T`, `n + 1`, `x` remain the same, `n` and `x` have new integer values, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` holds the count of '0' characters in `s`, `cnt1` holds the count of '1' characters in `s`**
