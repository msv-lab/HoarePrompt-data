Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting based on spaces. Since the values are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`, the values of `n` and `x` are now integers. The previous value of `T` is unknown, so the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
