According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `prefix_balances[i]` needs to be updated based on the new values.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the new values**
