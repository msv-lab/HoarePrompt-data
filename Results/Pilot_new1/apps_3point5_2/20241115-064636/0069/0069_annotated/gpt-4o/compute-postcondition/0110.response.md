Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `count` and `prefix_balances` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `count` is an integer that has been incremented by 1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `count` is an integer that has been incremented by 1**
