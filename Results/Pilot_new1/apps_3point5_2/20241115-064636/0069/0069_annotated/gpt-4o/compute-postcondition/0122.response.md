According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 2 elements, and the value of `result` is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must have at least 3 elements, and the value of `result` must be printed again.
State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the value of `result` is printed again**
