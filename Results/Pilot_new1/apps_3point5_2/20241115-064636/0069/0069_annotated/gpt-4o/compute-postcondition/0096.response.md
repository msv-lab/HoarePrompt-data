Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Each element in `prefix_balances` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. The balance is equal to 0. The element `x` is in `prefix_balances`, and `results` appends -1.**
