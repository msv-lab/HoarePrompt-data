According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `results` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the value of `result` is printed again. To execute the loop one more time, the `results` list must have at least 4 elements, and the `result` variable should move to the next element in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 1 element, `results` has at least 4 elements, and the value of `result` is the next element in the list**
