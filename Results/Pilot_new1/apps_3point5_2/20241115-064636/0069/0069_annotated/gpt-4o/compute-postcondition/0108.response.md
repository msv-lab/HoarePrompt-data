Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1. `count` is an integer that is incremented by 1 if the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true, where `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`. The postcondition covers all edge cases including when the condition is met and when it is not met, ensuring the integrity of the program variables and their relationships.***
