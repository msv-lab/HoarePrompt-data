Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the number of 0s and 1s in the string correctly.
3. It calculates the balance of the string correctly.
4. It handles the case where the balance is equal to the desired balance by printing n+1, which represents the whole string as a valid prefix.
5. It correctly handles the case where there is an infinite number of prefixes by checking if (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), and prints -1 accordingly.
6. It calculates and prints the number of prefixes when there is a finite number of valid prefixes.
7. The program iterates through all the test cases and produces the correct output for each case.
