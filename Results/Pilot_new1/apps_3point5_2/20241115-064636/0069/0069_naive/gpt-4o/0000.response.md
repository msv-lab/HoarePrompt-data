Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input for the number of test cases and for each test case, it calculates the balance of the string and then iterates through the prefixes of the string to check if the balance of the prefix matches the desired balance 'x'. It correctly handles the case where the balance is 0 and checks if 'x' is in the prefix balances list to determine if there are infinite prefixes. It also correctly counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance 'x' and outputs the result for each test case. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
