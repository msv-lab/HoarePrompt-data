Postcondition: ***'s' is a string, prefix_balances is a list containing the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in 's' up to index i. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of size 1 with the first element as 0. If balance is 0, results appends -1 if x is in prefix_balances, otherwise results appends 0. If balance is not 0, count is an integer representing the number of elements in prefix_balances list that satisfy the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0. If the loop does not execute, count remains 0 and has been appended to results.***
