Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, s is assigned the value at index + 2 of the data list, prefix_balances contains the updated prefix sums, n is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, x is updated to the integer value at index + 1 of the data list, index is incremented by 3, balance is 0, count is an integer based on the specified conditions, results list contains the updated values of count. If balance is 0, and x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to the results list. If balance is 0 and x is not in prefix_balances, 0 is appended to the results list. If balance is not 0, count is the number of elements in prefix_balances for which the condition is satisfied. x, b, and balance retain their original values after the loop execution. If n is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, and the variables remain in their initial state.***
