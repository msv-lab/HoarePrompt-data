Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is used to access a specific element in the list. The value of `n` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `n` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' is a string, prefix_balances is a list containing the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in 's' up to index i, and `n` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **'s' is a string, prefix_balances is a list containing the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in 's' up to index i, and `n` is decremented by 1**
