Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty list with more elements, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `n` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `x` is updated based on the data list, `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `count` is an integer. If (x - b) % balance is equal to 0 and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by 1. This holds true for all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
