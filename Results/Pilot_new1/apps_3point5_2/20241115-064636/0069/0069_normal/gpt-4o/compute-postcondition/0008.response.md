Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the value of `data` at index `index + 2`. The variables `T`, `_`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`**
