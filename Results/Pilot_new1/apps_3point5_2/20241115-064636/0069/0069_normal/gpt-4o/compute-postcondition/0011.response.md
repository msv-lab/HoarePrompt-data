Example Answer:
A list `prefix_balances` of size `n + 1` is initialized with all elements as 0. The variables `T`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. The variable `balance` is calculated based on the value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index`, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index `index + 1`, `s` is the value of `data` at index `index + 2`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0**
