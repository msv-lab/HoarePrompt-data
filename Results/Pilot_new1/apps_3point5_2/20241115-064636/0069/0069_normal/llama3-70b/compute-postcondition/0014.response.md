Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, `n` and `x` are input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This covers all possible scenarios where the code calculates and prints the appropriate result based on the conditions provided.***
