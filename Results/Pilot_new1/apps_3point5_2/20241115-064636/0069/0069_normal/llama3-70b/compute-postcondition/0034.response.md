Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If balance equals x, then the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) does not equal 0, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all scenarios of the program execution and maintains the relationships between the variables.***
