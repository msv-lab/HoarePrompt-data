Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, then iterates `T` times. During each iteration, it reads integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, and calculates the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`. It then calculates the balance as the difference between the counts of '0' and '1'. Based on the balance and `x`, it prints different values. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` equals 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.**
