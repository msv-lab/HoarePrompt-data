Example Answer:
The value of `floor` is calculated as the integer division of `floor_within_block` by `k`, then incremented by 1. The previous values of `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `floor` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, `floor` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, `floor` is calculated as described**
