Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers, `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, `min_floor_time` are calculated based on the given formulas. If a_floor is greater than b_floor, min_floor_time is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If a_floor is less than or equal to b_floor, min_floor_time is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block. The code then prints the sum of min_block_time and min_floor_time.**
