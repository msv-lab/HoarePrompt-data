Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`, where `b` and `m` are known values. The value of `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers, `a_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided, and `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided.
