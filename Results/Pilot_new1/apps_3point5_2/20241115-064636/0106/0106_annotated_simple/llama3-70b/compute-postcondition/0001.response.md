Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts an input and splits it, `int` converts each split value to an integer, and `map` applies the conversion to each split value. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by the input values after conversion to integers. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers**
