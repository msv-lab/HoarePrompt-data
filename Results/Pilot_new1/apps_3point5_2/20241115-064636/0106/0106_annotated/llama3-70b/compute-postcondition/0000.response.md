Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k**
