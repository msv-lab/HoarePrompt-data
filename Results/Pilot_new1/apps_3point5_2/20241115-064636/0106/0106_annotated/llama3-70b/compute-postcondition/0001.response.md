Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `a` and `b` are within the range of 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, k are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, `a` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, `b` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, `a` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, `b` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k**
