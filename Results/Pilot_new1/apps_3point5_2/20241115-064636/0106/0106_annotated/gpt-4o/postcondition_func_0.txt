The function func_1 accepts five positive integers n, m, k, a, and b. It calculates the total time required for a person at location a to reach location b in a building with multiple blocks and floors. The time includes the time to exit the current floor, the time to walk between blocks, the time to reach the target floor, and the minimum walk time between blocks. The function returns the total time based on these calculations. If the person is already on the first floor, the time to exit is 0.
