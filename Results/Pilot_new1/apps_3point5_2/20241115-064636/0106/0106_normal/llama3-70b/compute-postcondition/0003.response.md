Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the formula given, where `a` is the input integer, `m` and `k` are unknown values, and `a_floor` is calculated accordingly. The output state is: `a` and `b` are assigned integer values from the input split operation, `n` and `m` have unknown values, `k` has an unknown value, and `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integer values from the input split operation, `n` and `m` have unknown values, `k` has an unknown value, and `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula**
