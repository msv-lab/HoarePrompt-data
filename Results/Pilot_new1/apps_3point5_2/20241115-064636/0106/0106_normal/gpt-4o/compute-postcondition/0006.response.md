Postcondition: ***`block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the block and floor numbers calculated based on the value of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the block and floor numbers returned by the function `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1.***
