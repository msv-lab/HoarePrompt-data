The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function calculates the total time based on the given conditions and variables. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept integers n, m, k, a, and b, and return the total time calculated based on the given conditions and variables.
