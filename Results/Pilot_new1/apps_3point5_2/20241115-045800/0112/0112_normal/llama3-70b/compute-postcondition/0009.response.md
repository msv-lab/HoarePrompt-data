According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list contains at least 4 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes contain at least 3 cubes and digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cubes. So for the loop to be executed one more time, cubes must contain at least 4 cubes.
State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 4 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cubes**
