Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the cubes and adds the string representation of the digit to the set digits. Since digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cube, the set will be updated with the string representation of the digits in the cubes. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cubes.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes contain at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of digits in the cubes**
