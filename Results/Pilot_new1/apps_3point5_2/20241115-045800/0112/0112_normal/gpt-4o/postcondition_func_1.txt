The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num` as a parameter. It iterates through the digits of the given number and checks if each digit can be formed using the numbers on the faces of the cubes Masha has. If a digit is found on a cube face that has not been used before, the function sets the corresponding boolean in `used_cubes` to True and continues to the next digit. If a digit cannot be formed using the available cube faces, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed, the function returns True. If the input `num` is less than 1, the function also returns False.
