Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if i is equal to the index of the cube where the digit is found, `found` is True if the digit is found on a cube face and False otherwise. If the digit is found on a cube face and that cube has not been used before, the corresponding boolean in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `found` remains False, and the loop continues.***
