According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has (1 ≤ n ≤ 3). 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `n`.
2. All other states remain the same as they are not directly related to the loop control.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has (1 ≤ n+1 ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num` with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if i is equal to the index of the cube where the digit is found, `found` is True if the digit is found on a cube face and False otherwise.**
