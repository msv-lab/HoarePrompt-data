Example Answer:
The positive integer `num` is converted to a string and then converted to a list of digits. The value of `num` is unknown based on the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num`**
