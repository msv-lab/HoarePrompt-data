The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num` as a parameter. The function checks if the given number can be formed using the numbers on the faces of the cubes Masha has. 

In Case 1, the function iterates through the digits of the given number and checks if each digit is present on any of the cube faces. If a digit is found on a cube face that has not been used before, the function sets the corresponding boolean in `used_cubes` to True and `found` to True, then breaks the loop. If the digit is not found on any cube face, `found` remains False. If `found` is still False after the loop, the function returns False. If there are more digits left in the `digits` list after the loop, `found` remains False.

In Case 2, if the loop does not execute (n < 1), the program returns False. Otherwise, the function returns True if the number can be formed using the numbers on the cube faces.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `num` and return True if the number can be formed using the numbers on the faces of the cubes Masha has, and False otherwise.
