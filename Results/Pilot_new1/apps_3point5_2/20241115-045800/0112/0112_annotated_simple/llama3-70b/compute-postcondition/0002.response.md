Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting, `digits` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting, `digits` is an empty set**
