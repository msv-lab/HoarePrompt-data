According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are still digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found` are in the same state as the initial state, and `found` is False. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the next digit in the list needs to be considered.
State: **`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found` are in the same state as the initial state, `found` is False, next digit in the list is considered**
