Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True. If the loop does not execute due to `n` being 0 or `used_cubes` already all being True, then the state remains the same as the initial state.**
