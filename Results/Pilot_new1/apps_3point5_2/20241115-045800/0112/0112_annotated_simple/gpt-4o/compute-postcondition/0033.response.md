Functionality: **The function `can_form_number` accepts a positive integer `num`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of cubes, and a list `cube_faces` containing n lists of 6 integers. It iterates through each digit in the number num and checks if it can be formed by any of the cubes' faces. If a digit cannot be formed by any cube, the function returns False. If all digits can be formed by at least one cube face, the function returns True. If n is 0 or cube_faces is empty, the function does not execute the loop.**
