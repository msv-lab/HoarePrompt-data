According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i`-th element is True if the `i`-th cube has been used, `found` is True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 1**
