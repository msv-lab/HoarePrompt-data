Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input of the number of cubes and the faces of each cube.
2. The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if a number can be formed using the given cubes.
3. The main function `func_1` iterates through numbers starting from 1 and checks if each number can be formed using the cubes, incrementing `x` until a number cannot be formed.
4. The program returns the maximum number `x` that can be formed using the cubes, which matches the problem description.
5. The program uses sets to store the faces of each cube, ensuring that duplicate digits on the same cube are handled correctly.
6. The program uses a brute-force approach to check all possible numbers that can be formed, ensuring that it covers all potential cases.
