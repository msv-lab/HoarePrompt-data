Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the precondition states that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, the value of `n` will be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3**
