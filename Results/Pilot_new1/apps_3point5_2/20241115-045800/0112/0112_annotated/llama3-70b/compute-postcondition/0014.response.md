Example Answer:
If `cubes` is a list with at least one sublist, the loop updates the set `digits` with string representations of the digits in each sublist. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. After the execution of the if statement, if '0' is not in `digits`, then '0' is removed from `digits`. The `digits` set is sorted in reverse order and joined to form a single string which is then converted to an integer and assigned to `max_num`.
Output State: **`cubes` is a list with at least one sublist or empty, `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits, '0' is removed if not in `digits`, `max_num` is an integer**
