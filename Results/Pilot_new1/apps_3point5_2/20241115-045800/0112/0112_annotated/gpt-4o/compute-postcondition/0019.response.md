Postcondition: ***`digits` contains at least one digit. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is terminated. If the conditions are not met, there is no change in the variables.***
