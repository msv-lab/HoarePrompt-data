According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` contains at least one digit ensures that the loop will execute. However, `used_cubes` being a list of `n` elements initialized to `False` and `found` being `False` need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. So, the states need to be adjusted to `digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `found` is `False`, and `i` is 0.
State: **`digits` contains at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0**
