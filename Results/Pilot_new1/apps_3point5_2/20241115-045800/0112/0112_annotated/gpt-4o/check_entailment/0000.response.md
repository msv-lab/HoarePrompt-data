Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `can_form_number` does not handle the restriction that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may incorrectly determine that certain numbers can be formed when they should not be possible according to the problem description. For example, if Masha has cubes with faces 6 7 8 9 0 1 and 2 3 4 5 6 7, the code may incorrectly determine that the number 96 can be formed, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
