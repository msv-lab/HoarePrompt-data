Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote by following the recipe's ratio of 1:2:4. It calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum of the ratios of lemons, apples, and pears available. Then, it multiplies this maximum number of lemons by the respective ratios of apples and pears to get the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote. The program handles all potential cases where Nikolay may not have enough of any fruit to make the compote, returning 0 in such cases. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all possible inputs.
