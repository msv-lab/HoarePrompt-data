The function `func` prompts the user to input three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. After that, it prints the sum of this minimum value added to itself twice and then four times. The function does not explicitly return any value. The function assumes that the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000.
