Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used in the compote based on the ratios provided (1:2:4) and then calculates the total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used. Additionally, the code handles the case where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote, in which case it correctly outputs 0. The annotations also align with the code and the problem description, providing a clear explanation of the code's functionality.
