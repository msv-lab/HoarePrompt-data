Example Answer:
`char` is appended to the end of `res`, so `res` now contains the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the previous character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`**
