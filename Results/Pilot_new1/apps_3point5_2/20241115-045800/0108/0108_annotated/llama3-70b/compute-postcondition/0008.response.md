Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. The value of `char` is used to determine the replacement character. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`**
