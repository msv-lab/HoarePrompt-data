Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet using the `ord` and `chr` functions. The replacement is limited to 1 occurrence. The variable `res` contains the next character in the alphabet after the original character in `char`. 
Output State: **`s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next character in the alphabet**
