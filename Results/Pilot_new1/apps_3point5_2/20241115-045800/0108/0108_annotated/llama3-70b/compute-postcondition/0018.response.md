Example Answer: 
The next character in the alphabet is added to the `res` variable, and the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s` is stored in the `char` variable. Therefore, after execution, `res` will contain the next character in the alphabet after `res`, and `char` will still hold the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is modified with the next character in the alphabet replacing the first character, `res` contains the next two characters in the alphabet, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`**
