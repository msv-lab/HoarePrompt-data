Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced once in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The updated `s` will have the first character replaced by the previous character in the alphabet. The variable `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the previous character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the previous character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet followed by the character `char`**
