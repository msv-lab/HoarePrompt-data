`i` and `j` are both assigned the value 0. The previous values of both variables are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
