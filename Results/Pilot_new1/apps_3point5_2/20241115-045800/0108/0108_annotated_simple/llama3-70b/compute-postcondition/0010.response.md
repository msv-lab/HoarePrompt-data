Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `char` to the `res` variable. Since the initial state mentions that `res` is the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by `char`, after executing the code, `res` will have the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by two occurrences of `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all the lowercase English alphabets, `res` is the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by two occurrences of `char`.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all the lowercase English alphabets, `res` is the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by two occurrences of `char`**
