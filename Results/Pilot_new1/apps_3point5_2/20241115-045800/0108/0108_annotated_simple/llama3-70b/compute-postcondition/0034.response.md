According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains the updated string with the new `char` added at the end. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `char` needs to be in `s` again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains the updated string with the new `char` added at the end**
