Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` string. The previous value of `res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of the next `char`, and the next `char` after the current one is in the string `s`. After adding `char` to `res`, the new value of `res` will contain the previous characters along with the newly added `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of the next `char`, the next `char` after the current one is in the string `s`, and the newly added `char`.
Output State: **`res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of the next `char`, the next `char` after the current one is in the string `s`, and the newly added `char`**
