The function `func` reads an input string `s` and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it appends that character to the result string `res` as many times as it appears in `s`, replacing the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. If `res` contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.
