According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of `target`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` needs to be incremented further.
2. `j` needs to be incremented further based on the comparison of characters at index `i` in `s` and index `j` in `target`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of `target`, `i` is incremented by 2, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison of characters at index `i` in `s` and index `j` in `target`**
