Example Answer:
The character 'char' in 's' is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. The replacement occurs only once. Therefore, the Output State is: If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a' and 'char', and 'char' is in 's', 's' is updated with the replacement of 'char' with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence.
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, 'res' contains the characters 'a' and 'char', and 'char' is in 's', 's' is updated with the replacement of 'char' with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence**
