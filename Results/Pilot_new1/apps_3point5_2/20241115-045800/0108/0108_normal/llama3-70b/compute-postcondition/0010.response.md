Example Answer:
The character 'char' is added to the end of the string 'res', so 'res' now contains 'aa' followed by the first character in the alphabet. The modified string 's' and the first occurrence of 'char' are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa' followed by the first character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa' followed by the first character in the alphabet**
