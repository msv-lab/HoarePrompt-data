Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, which already contains the character 'a'. The value of `char` is the first character in the alphabet, so after execution, `res` will contain 'aa'. The modified string `s` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is the first character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by 'b', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aa', `char` is the first character in the alphabet**
