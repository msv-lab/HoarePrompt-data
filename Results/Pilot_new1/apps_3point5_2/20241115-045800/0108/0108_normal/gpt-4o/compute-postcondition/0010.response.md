Postcondition: ***s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is 26, i is incremented by 1. If s[i] matches target[j], then j is incremented by 1. This condition covers all cases where the characters in s match the corresponding characters in target, leading to an increment in j. If there is no match, j remains unchanged. The postcondition ensures that the program maintains the integrity of the variables and correctly updates j based on the matching condition.***
