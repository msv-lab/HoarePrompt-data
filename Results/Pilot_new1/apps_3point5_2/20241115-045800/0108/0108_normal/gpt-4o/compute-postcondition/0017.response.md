Output State: **If the loop executes fully, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`. If `s` matches `target` completely, `i` reaches the length of `s` and `j` reaches `target_len`. If `s` does not contain all the characters of `target`, `i` reaches the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. If `s` contains extra characters not in `target`, `i` is greater than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. If `s` is empty or `target` is empty, the loop does not execute and `i` and `j` remain 0.**
