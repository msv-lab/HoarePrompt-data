Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an input string `s` and compares it to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. It prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if `s` contains all the characters in order, otherwise it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value. Edge cases include when `s` is empty, `target` is empty, or `s` contains extra characters not in `target`.**
