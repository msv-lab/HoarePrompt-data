According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop executes. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously computed values, `(n, k)` is not a key in `dp`, and the program returns 0 as the output.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously computed values, `(n, k)` is not a key in `dp`, and the program returns 0 as the output**
