According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, `r` are integers. To execute one more time, `num` needs to be updated to the next number in the range from `l` to `r`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`total_sum`, `num + 1`, `l`, `r` are integers**
