According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `num + 1`, `l`, `r` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD. In all other cases where `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of the variables. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num + 1` needs to be less than or equal to `r`.
State: **`total_sum`, `num + 1`, `l`, `r` are integers where `num + 1` is less than or equal to `r`**
