According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range specified by `l` and `r`. If the current `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to the new value calculated by `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is equal to `l`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next `num` value should be such that `num + 1` is less than or equal to `r`.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, next `num` is such that `num + 1` is less than or equal to `r`**
