The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function returns the updated value of total_sum after evaluating func_1(num, k) for each num in the range from l to r. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the updated value of total_sum after evaluating func_1(num, k) for each num in the range from l to r.
