Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `dp`, and `i` are used in the calculation. After execution, the new value of `dp[n, k]` is stored in the dictionary. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with updated dp[n, k], i is 2.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with updated dp[n, k], i is 2**
