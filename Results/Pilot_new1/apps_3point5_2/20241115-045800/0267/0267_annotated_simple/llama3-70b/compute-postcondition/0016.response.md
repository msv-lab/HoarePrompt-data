According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is the result of the expression provided. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **The updated value of `dp[n, k]` is the result of the expression provided, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration**
