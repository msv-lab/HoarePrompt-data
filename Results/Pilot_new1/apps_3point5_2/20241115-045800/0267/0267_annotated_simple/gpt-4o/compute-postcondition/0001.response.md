According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Before the loop starts, the total_sum is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the total_sum remains 0, and `num` should be equal to `l`, as that is the starting value for the loop iteration.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
