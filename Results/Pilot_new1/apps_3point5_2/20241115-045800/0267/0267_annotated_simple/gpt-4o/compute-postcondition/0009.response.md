Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, and `num` is equal to `l + 2`. Since `l` is less than or equal to `r` and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true, the value of `num` is `l + 2`. Therefore, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 2`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**
