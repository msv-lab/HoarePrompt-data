Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0 (c = 0) and checks if the favorite number b is equal to the first element a.
2. It also correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is not 0 (c != 0) by checking if the favorite number b can be reached from the first element a by adding multiples of c.
