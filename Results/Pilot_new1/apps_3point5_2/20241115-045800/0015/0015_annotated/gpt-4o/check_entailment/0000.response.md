Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the condition `((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0)` is satisfied, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem description:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'.
2. If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'.
3. If `c` is not equal to 0, and the condition `((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0)` is satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
4. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the program logic, which aligns with the problem description. There are no cases mentioned in the annotations that contradict the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
