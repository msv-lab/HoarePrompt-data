Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It handles the scenario where the difference between neighboring elements is 0 separately, ensuring that if the favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, it prints 'YES'. For other cases where the difference is non-zero, it checks if the favorite number can be reached from the first element based on the difference and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The code annotations also describe the logic implemented in the code accurately, providing a clear understanding of how the program works. Overall, the code covers all possible cases and produces the correct output as described in the problem statement.
