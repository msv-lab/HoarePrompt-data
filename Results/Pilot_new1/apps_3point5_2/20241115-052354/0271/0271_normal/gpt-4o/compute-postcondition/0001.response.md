Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, where `%` is the modulo operator that calculates the remainder of the division of `n` by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the possible values of `remainder` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 depending on the last digit of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9**
