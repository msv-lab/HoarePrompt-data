Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `remainder` can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the value of `result` will be `n` minus one of those values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is the result of `n - remainder`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is the result of `n - remainder`**
