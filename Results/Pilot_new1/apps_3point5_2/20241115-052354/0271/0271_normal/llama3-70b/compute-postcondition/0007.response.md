Example Answer:
The code calculates n + (10 - n % 10). Since n is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5, the expression n % 10 will be less than 5. Therefore, 10 - n % 10 will always be greater than 5. Adding this value to n will result in a number that ends in a digit greater than 5. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is greater than 5.**
