Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It rounds the input number `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it rounds `n` down to the nearest tens place if the units place is less than or equal to 5, and rounds `n` up to the nearest tens place if the units place is greater than 5. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and the output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
