Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the difference between `n` and `remainder`. If `remainder` is between 6 and 9, `result` is calculated as `n` plus the difference between 10 and `remainder`.**
