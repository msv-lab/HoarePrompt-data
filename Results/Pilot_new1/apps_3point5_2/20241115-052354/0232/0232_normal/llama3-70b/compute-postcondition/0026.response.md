Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers with at least one color, `counts` is a list of integers created from the input values, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys representing each unique color in `colors` and their corresponding counts, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the color not in it, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. If the color is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0.***
