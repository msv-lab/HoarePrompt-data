Output State: **After the loop executes, `window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `i` is the starting index, `n` is the upper bound, `color` is the current color, and `found` is True if the matching counts are found, otherwise False. If `n` is greater than the length of `colors`, the loop does not execute. If `colors` is an empty list, `found` remains False. Finally, 'YES' is printed if `found` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed.**
