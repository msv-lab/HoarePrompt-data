Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the colors list, incrementing counts of each color in `current_counts`. 
- It checks if all colors reach their desired counts specified in `desired_counts`, and if so, it returns 'YES'. If the loop completes without meeting this condition, it returns 'NO'.
- The code handles the case where `left` exceeds the length of the colors list by ending the loop without returning 'YES'.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it follows the problem description for every potential case.
