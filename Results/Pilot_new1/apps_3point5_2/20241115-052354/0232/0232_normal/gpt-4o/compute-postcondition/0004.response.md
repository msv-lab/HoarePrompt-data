Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `current_counts` is updated with the incremented value, `left` is 0, `right` is n.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `current_counts` is updated with the incremented value, `left` is 0, `right` is n**
