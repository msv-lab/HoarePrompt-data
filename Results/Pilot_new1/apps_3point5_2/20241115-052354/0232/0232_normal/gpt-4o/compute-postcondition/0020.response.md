According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` was updated with an incremented count for the color at index `right + 1`, `right` is `right + 1`, `left` is unchanged. To execute the loop one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to `right + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts` updated with an incremented count for the color at index `right + 2`, `right` is `right + 2`, `left` is unchanged**
