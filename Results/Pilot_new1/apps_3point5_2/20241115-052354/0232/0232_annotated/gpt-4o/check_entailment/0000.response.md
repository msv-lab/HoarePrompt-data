Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description by iterating through the colors list and updating the counts of each color in `current_counts`. It then checks if all counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts`, returning 'YES' if they do. If the loop completes without this condition being met, it returns 'NO'. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code logic and confirm that the code aligns with the problem description. Additionally, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples.
