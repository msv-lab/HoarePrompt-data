According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop may have executed or not based on the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than the current `n` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **colors, counts, color_counts, and n remain unchanged. Window_counts contains the count of each color encountered during the loop iterations. If found is True, the loop breaks and found is set to True. If the loop does not break, found remains False.**
