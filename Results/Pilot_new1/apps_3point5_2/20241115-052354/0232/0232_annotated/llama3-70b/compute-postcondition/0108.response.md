Output State: **After the execution, `window_counts` is updated with `color` having a count of 0, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts` after sorting, `i` is the next index value (incremented by 1), `n` remains greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 0. The program breaks out of the loop if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts` after sorting, setting `found` to True.**
