Postcondition: ***`colors` is a non-empty list, `counts` remains unchanged, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the color `color` is present with a count of 0 if it was not already in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in `counts` after sorting. If the color `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 0.***
