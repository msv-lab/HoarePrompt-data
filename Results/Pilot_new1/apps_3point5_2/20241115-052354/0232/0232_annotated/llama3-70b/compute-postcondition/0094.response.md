Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is updated with `color` having a count of 1. `found` remains unchanged. `i` is set to its initial value. `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 0. The counts of values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting.***
