Postcondition: ***The loop iterates through the colors list, updating the window_counts dictionary with the count of each color. If all counts in window_counts match the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks. If the loop does not execute, found remains False. After the loop executes, colors, counts, color_counts, and n remain unchanged. Window_counts contains the count of each color encountered during the loop iterations. If found is True, the loop breaks and found is set to True. All other variables remain the same: colors, counts, color_counts, and n remain unchanged. Window_counts retains the count of each color encountered during the loop iterations. If the loop does not break, found remains False.***
