Example Answer:
The variable `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This initialization does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is not empty, `counts` remains the same, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`colors` is not empty, `counts` remains the same, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
