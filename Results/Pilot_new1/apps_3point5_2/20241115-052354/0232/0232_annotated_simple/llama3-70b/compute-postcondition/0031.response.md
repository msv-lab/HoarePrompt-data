Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean value indicating whether the desired counts of lightsabers of each color have been found. `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, `color_counts` contains the counts of each color, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and 1 as value, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. If all the counts of each color in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
