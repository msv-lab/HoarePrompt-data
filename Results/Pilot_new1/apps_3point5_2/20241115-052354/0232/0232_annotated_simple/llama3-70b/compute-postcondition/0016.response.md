Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors with at least one more color left to iterate over. If the color is not in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is set to 0, and the count of `color` in `color_counts` is incremented by 1.**
