Postcondition: ***found is a boolean. If all counts in window_counts are equal to their respective targets, found is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop. n, m, counts, colors, color_counts, i, j are all less than n. The values of color and window_counts[color] are updated accordingly. If color is not in window_counts, window_counts[color] is set to 1. This postcondition covers all cases where the program fragment executes, ensuring the state of the variables after the execution.***
