Postcondition: ***`current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 0 and at least one color in `current_counts` has a value less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`. If all colors in `current_counts` have the same values as the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`, then the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not alter the state of the variables.***
