Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It calculates the counts of different colors of lightsabers and compares them to desired counts. If all colors in `current_counts` match the corresponding colors in `desired_counts`, it returns 'YES'. If there is any color with a count lower than desired, it returns 'NO'. In the case where `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function sets `current_counts` as a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` to 0, and `right` to 0, and returns 'NO'.**
