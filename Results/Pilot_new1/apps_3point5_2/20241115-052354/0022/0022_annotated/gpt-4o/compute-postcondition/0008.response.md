According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. 
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is 2**
