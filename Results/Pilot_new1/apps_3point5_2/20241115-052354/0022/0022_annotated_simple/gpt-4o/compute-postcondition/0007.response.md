Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than `n // 2` and `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This covers all cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal in the string `s`.***
