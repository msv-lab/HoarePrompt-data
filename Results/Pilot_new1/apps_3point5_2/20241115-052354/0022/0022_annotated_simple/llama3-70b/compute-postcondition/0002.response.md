Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. Since no other variables are affected by this assignment, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
