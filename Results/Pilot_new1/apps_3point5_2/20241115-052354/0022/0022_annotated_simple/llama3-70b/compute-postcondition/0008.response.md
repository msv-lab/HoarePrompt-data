According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is the length of `s`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2` and the characters at symmetric positions in the string must match. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` need to be equal.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
