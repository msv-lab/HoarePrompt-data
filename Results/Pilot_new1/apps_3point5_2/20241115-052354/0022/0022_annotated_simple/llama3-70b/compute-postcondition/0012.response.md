According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a palindrome where `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 + 1` to move to the next character pair in the string. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a palindrome, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`**
