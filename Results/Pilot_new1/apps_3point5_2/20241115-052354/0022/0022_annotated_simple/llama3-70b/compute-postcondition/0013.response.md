Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a palindrome, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, `is_spalindrome` is False.
Output State: **`s` is a palindrome, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, `is_spalindrome` is False**
