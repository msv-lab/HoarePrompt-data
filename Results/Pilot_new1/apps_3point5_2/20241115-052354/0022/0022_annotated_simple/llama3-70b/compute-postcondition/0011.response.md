Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement breaks. This condition covers all cases where the characters at symmetric positions do not match, indicating that the string `s` is not a palindrome.***
