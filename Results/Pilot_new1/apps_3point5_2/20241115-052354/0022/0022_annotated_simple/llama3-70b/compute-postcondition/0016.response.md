According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a palindrome, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n // 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a palindrome, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2`**
