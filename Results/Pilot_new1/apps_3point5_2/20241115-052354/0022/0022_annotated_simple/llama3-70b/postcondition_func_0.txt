The function `func` reads an input string `s`, calculates its length `n`, and checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters at symmetric positions. If the characters do not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function does not execute the loop. Finally, the function prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not explicitly return any value.
