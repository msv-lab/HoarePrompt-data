Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, so the new value of `n` will be the original value of `n` followed by the character `c`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `t` is a string, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one more character to iterate over, `t` is a string, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`**
