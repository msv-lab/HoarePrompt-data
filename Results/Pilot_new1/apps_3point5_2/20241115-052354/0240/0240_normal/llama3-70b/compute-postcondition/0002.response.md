According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. Since `s` is a very large integer with at most 1,000,000 digits, it is safe to assume that the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an empty string, which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at most 1,000,000 digits, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`.
State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at most 1,000,000 digits, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is an empty string**
