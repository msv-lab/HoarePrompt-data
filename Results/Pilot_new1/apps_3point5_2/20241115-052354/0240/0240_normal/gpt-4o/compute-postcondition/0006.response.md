Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the joined permutation of characters in the list `perm`. The values of `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`**
