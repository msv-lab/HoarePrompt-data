Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` which contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`. The variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are affected by this code. The output state is `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next `perm`**
