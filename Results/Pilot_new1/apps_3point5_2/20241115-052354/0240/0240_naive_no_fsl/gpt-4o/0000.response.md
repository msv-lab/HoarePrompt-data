Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the case where the substring contains leading zeroes. In the problem description, it is mentioned that the substring can contain leading zeroes, but the program does not account for this scenario. This means that for inputs where the substring contains leading zeroes, the program will not produce the correct output.

For example:
Input:
003512
0210

Output:
300021

Expected Output:
30021

Since the program fails to handle cases where the substring contains leading zeroes, the correctness of the program is False.
