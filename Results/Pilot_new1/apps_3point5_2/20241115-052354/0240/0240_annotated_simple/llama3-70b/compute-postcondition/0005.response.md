Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, `n` is any value. If the character `c` is present in the set `t_set`, then `n` is updated by adding the character `c`. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables `s`, `t`, `t_set`, and `n`.***
