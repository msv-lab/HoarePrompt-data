According to the code, the loop execution depends on the character `c` in the string `s`. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` is incremented by `c`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, and `n` is updated based on the last character `c` in `s`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the next character `c` in `s` is in `t_set`, then `n` should be incremented by `c`.
- Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`**
