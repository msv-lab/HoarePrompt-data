Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`. If the character `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is incremented by `c`. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.***
