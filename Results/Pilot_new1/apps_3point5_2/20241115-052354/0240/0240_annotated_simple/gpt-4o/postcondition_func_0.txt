The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It subtracts the counts of characters in `sub` from `s`, generates a list of possible numbers based on the remaining characters, and then returns the smallest number from that list through integer comparison. However, the current implementation does not consider cases where `sub_counter` is empty, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
