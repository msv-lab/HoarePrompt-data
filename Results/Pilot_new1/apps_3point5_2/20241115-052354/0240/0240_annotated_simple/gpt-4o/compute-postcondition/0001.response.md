Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the concatenation of all permutations of the characters in `perm`. The values of `chars` and `sub` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`**
