According to the code, the loop can execute if the `chars` string has at least one digit. Additionally, the loop requires the `permutations` function to work with the `chars` string, which means the `chars` string should be valid for permutation generation. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `chars` should have at least one digit, and `sub` should be a valid substring of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`**
