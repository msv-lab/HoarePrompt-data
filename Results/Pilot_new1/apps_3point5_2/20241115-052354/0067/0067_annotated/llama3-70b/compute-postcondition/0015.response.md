Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The condition (x > y + z) is false. x is less than y. If x is equal to y and z is equal to 0, the program prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not equal to 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'***
