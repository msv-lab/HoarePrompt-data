Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then, it compares these values to determine the result (+, -, or ?) according to the rules specified in the problem description. The annotations also describe the expected behavior of the program after the if-else block has been executed, which aligns with the problem requirements. 

All the provided examples in the problem description are covered by the program, and the output matches the expected results. Additionally, the annotations do not suggest any edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program can be considered correct.
