Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`. If the sum of `x` and `z` is less than `y`, the program prints '-'. If the sum of `y` and `z` is less than `x`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
