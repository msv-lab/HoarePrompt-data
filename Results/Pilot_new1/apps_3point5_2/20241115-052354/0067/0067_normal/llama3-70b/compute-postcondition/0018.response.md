The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to output different messages based on the following conditions:
- If x, y, and z are all equal, the function returns "All numbers are equal".
- If x, y, and z are all different, the function returns "All numbers are different".
- If x, y, and z are partially equal (only two of them are equal), the function returns "Two numbers are equal".
- If x, y, and z are partially equal (all are different), the function returns "Two numbers are different".
- If x, y, and z are partially equal (only one of them is equal), the function returns "Two numbers are different".
- If x, y, and z are partially equal, the function returns "Two numbers are equal".
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to output different messages based on the relationship between the non-negative integers x, y, and z.
