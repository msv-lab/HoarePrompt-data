Output State: **x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100 based on user input; min_upvotes is assigned the value of x; max_upvotes is assigned the value of x + z; min_downvotes is assigned the value of y; max_downvotes is assigned the value of y + z. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, so the program enters the else block. The program prints '+'.**
