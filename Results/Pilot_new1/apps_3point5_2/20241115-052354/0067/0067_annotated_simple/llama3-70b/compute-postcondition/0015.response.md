Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x is equal to y and z is equal to 0, the program prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?' while maintaining the initial conditions on x, y, and z. The relationships x is not greater than y+z, x is not less than y, and y is less than or equal to x, z is less than or equal to x are preserved throughout the execution of the program.***
