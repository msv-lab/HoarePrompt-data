Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The initial values are `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is greater than 0. After the execution, the new value of `numerator` will be the result of the multiplication operation. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
