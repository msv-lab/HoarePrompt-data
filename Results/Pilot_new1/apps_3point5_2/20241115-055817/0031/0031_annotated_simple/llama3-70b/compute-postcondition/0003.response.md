According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is 2 to the power of n, numerator is 1, and denominator is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
