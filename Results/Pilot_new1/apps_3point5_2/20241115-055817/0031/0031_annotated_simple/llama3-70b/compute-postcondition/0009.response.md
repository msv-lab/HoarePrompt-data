According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by `total_days`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - 2`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by `total_days`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
