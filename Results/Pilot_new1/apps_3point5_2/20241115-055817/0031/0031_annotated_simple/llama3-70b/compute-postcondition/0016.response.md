Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`. The values of `denominator`, `total_days`, `k`, and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `denominator` is updated based on the value of `gcd`, `total_days`, `k`, and `gcd` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`denominator` is updated based on the value of `gcd`, `total_days`, `k`, and `gcd` remain unchanged**
