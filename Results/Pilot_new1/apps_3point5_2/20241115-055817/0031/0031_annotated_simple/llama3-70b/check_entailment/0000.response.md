Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. It calculates the numerator and denominator as described in the problem statement.
3. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator and reduces the fraction to its irreducible form.
4. Finally, it returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator modulo 10^6 + 3.
5. The program logic aligns with the problem description and handles the calculations accurately.
