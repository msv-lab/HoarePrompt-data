The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It then performs a loop where `a` and `b` are updated based on certain operations. The function returns the final value of `a` after the loop executes. If `b` is initially 0, the loop will not execute, and the function will return the initial value of `a`. The functionality does not handle cases where `b` is negative.
