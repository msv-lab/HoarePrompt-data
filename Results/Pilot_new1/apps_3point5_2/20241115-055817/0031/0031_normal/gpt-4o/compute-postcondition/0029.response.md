Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the values of p_shared, A, and B based on the given formulas and then calls another function func_1 with A and B as parameters. The function then prints the modulo of A and B.**
