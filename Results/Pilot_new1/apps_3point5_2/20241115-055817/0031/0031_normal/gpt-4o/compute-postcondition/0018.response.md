Output State: **`numerator` is updated based on the formula `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is the number of iterations completed, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1.**
