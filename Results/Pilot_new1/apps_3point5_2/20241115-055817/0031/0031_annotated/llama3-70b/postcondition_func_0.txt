The function func_1 accepts two integers n and k, calculates their remainders when divided by 1000003, and returns these remainders. It calculates the remainders of numerator and denominator after performing certain operations. The function correctly calculates the remainders of numerator and denominator, but it does not include an edge case where k is 0 or negative, which might lead to unexpected behavior as the loop does not execute in those cases.
