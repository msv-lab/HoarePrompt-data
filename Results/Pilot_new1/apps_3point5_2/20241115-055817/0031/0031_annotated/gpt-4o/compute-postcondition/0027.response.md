Example Answer: 
`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the modified value after integer division with `g`. The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` are not provided, so their impact cannot be determined. The code then prints the modulo of `A` and `B` with `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the modified value after integer division with `g`, and the code prints the modulo of `A` and `B` with `MOD`.
Output State: **numerator is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the modified value after integer division with `g`, and the code prints the modulo of `A` and `B` with `MOD`**
