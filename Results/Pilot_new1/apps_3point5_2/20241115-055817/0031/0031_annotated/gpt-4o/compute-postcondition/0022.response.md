Example Answer:
The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, but the initial state of `p_shared` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, and `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
Output State: **`numerator` is assigned to `p_no_shared`, `p_total` is assigned to an undefined `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, and `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`**
