Functionality: ** The function func_2 accepts two integers n and k, assigns a value to MOD, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates the values of p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g based on the values of n, k, and MOD. Finally, it prints the values of A and B modulo MOD. **
