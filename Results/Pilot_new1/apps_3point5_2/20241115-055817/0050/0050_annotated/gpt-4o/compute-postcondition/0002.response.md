Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive, and `b` is a list of integers created from the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive, `b` is a list of integers created from the input values**
