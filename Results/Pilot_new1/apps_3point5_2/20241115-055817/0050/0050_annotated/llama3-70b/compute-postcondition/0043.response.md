Output State: **If `r` is less than the smallest denomination in `s`, the loop will not execute and `shares` will remain 0. If the loop executes, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` will have their final values based on the loop's execution. The loop calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` using the denominations in `s`, updating `shares` accordingly. After the loop, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` will have their final values.**
