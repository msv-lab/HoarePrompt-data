Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges. The input is split based on spaces. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges based on the input**
