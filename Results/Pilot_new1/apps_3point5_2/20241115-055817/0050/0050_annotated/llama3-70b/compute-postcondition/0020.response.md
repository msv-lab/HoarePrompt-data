Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated to the remainder of dividing `r` by `s[i]`. The value of `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` is updated to the remainder of dividing `r` by `s[i]`, `s`, `b`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`, `i+1`**
