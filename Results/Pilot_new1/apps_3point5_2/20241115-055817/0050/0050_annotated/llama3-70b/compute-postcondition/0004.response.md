Example Answer: 
The list `b` is sorted in descending order. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges based on the input, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges based on the input, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**
