Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous values of `r`, `shares`, and `b[i]` are not given, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i+1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `i` is the next iteration value.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i+1]`, `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `i` is the next iteration value**
