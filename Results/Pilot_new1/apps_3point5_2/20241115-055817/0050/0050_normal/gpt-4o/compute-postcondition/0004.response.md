Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value in list `b`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 30 and 1 <= `r` <= 1000. `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000. `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n`, `m` <= 30 and 1 <= `r` <= 1000. `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000. `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`**
