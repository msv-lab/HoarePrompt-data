Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the values entered through input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list containing the entered integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list containing the entered integers**
