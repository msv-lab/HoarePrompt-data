Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` are as described above. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, and `i` are maintained according to the described conditions.***
