Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it computes the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining amount of money after buying those shares, and the total amount of money after selling the bought shares. The function prints the total amount of money. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
