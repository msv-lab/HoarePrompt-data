Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price` remain unchanged. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the value of `r` is printed. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The value of `total_bourles` is then printed.***
