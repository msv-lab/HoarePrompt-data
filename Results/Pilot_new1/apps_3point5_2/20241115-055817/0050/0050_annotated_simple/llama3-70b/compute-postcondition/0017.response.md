Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within specified ranges, `b` is a list containing mapped input values sorted in reverse order, `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by the floor division result of `r` divided by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop.***
