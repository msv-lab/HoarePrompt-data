Example Answer: 
A list `b` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces, and the integers are stored in the list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `b` is a list containing the mapped input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, and `b` is a list containing the mapped input values**
