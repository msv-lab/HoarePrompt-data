Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two elements. `data[0]` either had leading zeros removed and was set to '0' or remained unchanged. `data[1]` retains its original value with leading zeros removed. `b` is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
