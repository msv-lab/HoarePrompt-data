Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed. The value of `data` is a list containing two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` with leading zeros removed and `data[1]` represents the string `b`. After executing the code, `b` will have leading zeros removed from the string `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list containing two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` with leading zeros removed and `data[1]` represents the string `b` with leading zeros removed.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing two elements, where `data[0]` represents the string `a` with leading zeros removed and `data[1]` represents the string `b` with leading zeros removed**
