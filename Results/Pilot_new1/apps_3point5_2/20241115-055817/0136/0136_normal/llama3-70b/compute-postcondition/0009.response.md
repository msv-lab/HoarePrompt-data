Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, and they are not equal to each other. If `a` is less than `b`, then '<' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, then '>' is printed. This covers all possible cases for the comparison between `a` and `b`.***
