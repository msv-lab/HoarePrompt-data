Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads two non-negative integers represented as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them to determine which number is greater. It handles the cases where the numbers are equal, one number is greater than the other, or the lengths of the numbers are different. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases. The annotations provided also accurately describe the flow of the program.
