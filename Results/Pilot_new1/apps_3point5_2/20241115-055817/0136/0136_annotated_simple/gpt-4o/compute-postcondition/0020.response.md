Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. If `a` was originally an empty string, it remains as '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`. After the execution of the else statement, `b` is guaranteed to be '0'.***
