Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string after removing leading zeros. If `a` was originally an empty string, `b` remains an empty string. In all cases, after the execution of the if statement, `b` is guaranteed to be '0'. The length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.**
