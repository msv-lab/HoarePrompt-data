Example Answer:
The input is taken and any leading zeros are removed from the input string, then assigned to variable `a`. The values of `a` and `b` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits**
