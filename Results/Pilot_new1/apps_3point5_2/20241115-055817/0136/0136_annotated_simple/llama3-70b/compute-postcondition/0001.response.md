Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input after removing any leading zeros. The input is a string, so `b` will be a string without leading zeros. The variable `a` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros**
