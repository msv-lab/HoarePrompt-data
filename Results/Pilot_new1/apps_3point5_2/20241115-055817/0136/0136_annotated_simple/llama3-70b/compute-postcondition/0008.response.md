Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('>')` simply prints the greater than symbol '>'. It does not affect the values of variables `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeros, but they are not equal to each other. `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no leading zeros, but they are not equal to each other. `a` is greater than or equal to `b`**
