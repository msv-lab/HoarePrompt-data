Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input correctly using sys.stdin.read().
2. It removes leading zeroes from both numbers a and b.
3. It compares the lengths of a and b, and if they are not equal, it prints "<" or ">" accordingly.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the actual values of a and b as strings, and prints "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison.
5. The program covers all cases mentioned in the problem description and handles the input of very large integers efficiently.
