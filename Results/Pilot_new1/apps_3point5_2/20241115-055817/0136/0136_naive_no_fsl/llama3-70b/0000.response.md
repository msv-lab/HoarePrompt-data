Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes. It then compares the two strings and prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on the comparison result. The program correctly handles the case where a < b, a > b, and a = b as described in the problem statement. The logic is simple and straightforward, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the program does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
