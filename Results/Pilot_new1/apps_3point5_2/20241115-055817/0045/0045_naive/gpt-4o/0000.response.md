Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than n, if so, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder by subtracting d * min_sum from n.
5. It constructs the sequence by multiplying each number in the sequence by d and then distributing the remainder among the numbers in the sequence.
6. The program then returns the resulting sequence.
7. The program handles all cases where a valid sequence can be constructed and returns -1 when no valid sequence is possible.
8. The program correctly outputs the resulting sequence or -1 based on the calculated result.
