Example Answer:
The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `k`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `min_sum`. Therefore, the output state is: Precondition: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is calculated based on the value of k.
Output State: **Precondition: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is calculated based on the value of k**
