The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum`.

Case_2: The program returns the modified sequence list after the loop execution.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, ensure that `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, and return the modified sequence list after the loop execution.
