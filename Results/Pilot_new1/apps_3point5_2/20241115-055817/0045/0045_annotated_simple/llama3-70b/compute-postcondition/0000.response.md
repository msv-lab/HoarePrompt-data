Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, the new value of `b` will always be less than the previous value of `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: a and b are positive integers, with updated values after the operation.
Output State: **a and b are positive integers, with updated values after the operation**
