Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. It returns the final value of `a`, which is the greatest common divisor. If `b` is 0, the function returns the initial value of `a` as the greatest common divisor.**
