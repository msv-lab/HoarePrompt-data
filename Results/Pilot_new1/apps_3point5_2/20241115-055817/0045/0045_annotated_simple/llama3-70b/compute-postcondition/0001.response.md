According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `b` needs to be adjusted so that it is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, with updated values after the operation and `b` is not equal to 0**
