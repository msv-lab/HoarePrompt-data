Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a valid way to calculate the GCD and is commonly used in such scenarios. Since the function is correctly implemented and returns the GCD as required by the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
