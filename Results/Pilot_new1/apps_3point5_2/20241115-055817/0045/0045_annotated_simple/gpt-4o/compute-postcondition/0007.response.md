According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the conditions for `min_sum` and `n` need to be checked to determine the initial state. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, then `d` is assigned the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`.

Output State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is assigned the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`, and `k` is at least 1**
