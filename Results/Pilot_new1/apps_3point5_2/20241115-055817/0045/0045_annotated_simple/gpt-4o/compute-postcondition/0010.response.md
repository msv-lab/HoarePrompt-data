Postcondition: ***If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, then `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`, and `k` is at least 1. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks from the loop.***
