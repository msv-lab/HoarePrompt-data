According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is the previous value of `b` and `b` is the remainder when the previous value of `a` is divided by the previous value of `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, the new values of `a` and `b` need to be such that `b` is not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a and b are positive integers where a is the previous value of b and b is the remainder when the previous value of a is divided by the previous value of b**
