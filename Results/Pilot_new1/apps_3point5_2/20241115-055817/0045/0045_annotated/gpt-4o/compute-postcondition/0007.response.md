According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the variables `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` are already defined based on the initial values of `n` and `min_sum`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the loop index `i` should be set to `k - 1`, and the loop should proceed in reverse order until `i` reaches -1.
State: **`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1; `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`; `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`; `i` is `k - 1` and `k` is greater than 0**
