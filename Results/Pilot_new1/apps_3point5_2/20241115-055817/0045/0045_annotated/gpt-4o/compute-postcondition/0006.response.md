Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created by multiplying `d` with `(i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. The initial state has `d` assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1; and `remainder` assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. Therefore, the output state is: `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1; `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.
Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum` if `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, otherwise -1; `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`**
