Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This aligns with the problem description that states the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length `x` is simply the absolute difference between the two side lengths. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.
