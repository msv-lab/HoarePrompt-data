Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This logic is correct as it directly corresponds to the problem description where Memory needs to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from a starting equilateral triangle of side length x. The minimum number of seconds required is indeed the absolute difference between x and y, which is correctly calculated by the program. 

For all possible valid inputs within the given constraints, the program will provide the correct output based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
