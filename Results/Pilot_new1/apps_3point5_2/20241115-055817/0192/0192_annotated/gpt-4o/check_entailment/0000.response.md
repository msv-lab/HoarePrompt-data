Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads two integers `x` and `y`, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from the equilateral triangle of side length `x`. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required. The code handles all the examples provided in the problem description and produces the correct output. The annotations also align with the code logic and do not suggest any edge cases that are not covered by the code. Hence, the code is correct.
