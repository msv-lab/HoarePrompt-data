Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `i` and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`**
