Output State: `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time, `i` is the next route index, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of routes, `s_i` and `d_i` are integers assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i + 1]`, and `wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
