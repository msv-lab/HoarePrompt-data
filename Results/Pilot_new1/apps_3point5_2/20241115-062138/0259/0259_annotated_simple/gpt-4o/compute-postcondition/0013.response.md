Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if-else block. Additionally, `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`***
