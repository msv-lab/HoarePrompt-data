Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown from the initial state, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, where `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions provided; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, where `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions provided; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
