According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0**
