Example Answer:
The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The `buses` list was initially empty, so after execution, it will contain one tuple `(s, d)`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer input, and `d` is an integer input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an integer input, and `d` is an integer input**
