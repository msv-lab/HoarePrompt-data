Example Answer:
The values of `s` and `d` are obtained by mapping the input to integers. The values of `s` and `d` are now updated with the newly input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` with the newly appended values of `s` and `d`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` with the newly appended values of `s` and `d`**
