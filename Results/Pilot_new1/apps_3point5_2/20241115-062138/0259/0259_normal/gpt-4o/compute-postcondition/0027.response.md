According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. The postcondition considers all scenarios where `wait_time` can be either 0 or computed based on the provided formula. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than `i + 1`.
State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
