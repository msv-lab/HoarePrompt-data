Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. The postcondition considers all scenarios where `wait_time` can be either 0 or computed based on the provided formula.***
