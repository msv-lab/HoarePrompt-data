Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `chosen_route` is a valid route value, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, `wait_time` is 0 if the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, otherwise `wait_time` is `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`***
