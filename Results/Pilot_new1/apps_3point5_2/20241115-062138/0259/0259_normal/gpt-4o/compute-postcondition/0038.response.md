Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop execution, `min_wait_time` will contain the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop. `chosen_route` will be the route number corresponding to the minimum wait time. If n is 0, the loop will not execute, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, while `chosen_route` will stay at -1.**
