Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This logic accounts for all possible scenarios where the values of `min_wait_time`, `n`, and the calculations involving `wait_time` are appropriately handled.***
