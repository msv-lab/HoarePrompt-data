Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least two tuples. `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is equal to i + 1 where i is incremented by 1, `(s, d)` is the next tuple in `buses`, `time` is calculated as described. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new time value and `ans` is updated to i + 1. The variables maintain their initial constraints and relationships after the execution of the if statement, covering all possible edge cases.***
