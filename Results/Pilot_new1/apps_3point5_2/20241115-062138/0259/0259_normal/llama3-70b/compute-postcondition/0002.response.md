According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. The loop will run as long as n is at least 1. The loop does not depend on the variables `t` and `buses`, so they can remain unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
