Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values of the integers obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is taken from the user, the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5**
