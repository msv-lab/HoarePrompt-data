Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, and `buses` contains tuples (s, d) where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input. If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.**
