Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then iterates through each bus route, calculates the time Serval needs to wait for the next bus of that route, and keeps track of the minimum waiting time and the corresponding bus route. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use based on the minimum waiting time. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output for the given examples as well.
