Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the first and second integers from the input, respectively. The list `buses` now contains at least two elements with the newly appended tuple. The value of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least two elements containing the previous elements and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `d` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least two elements containing the previous elements and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `d` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input**
