Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the next bus route values, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This covers all possible scenarios of the program execution.***
