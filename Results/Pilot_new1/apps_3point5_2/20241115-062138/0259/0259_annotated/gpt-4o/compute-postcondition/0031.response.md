Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `t` is not defined in the initial state. The other variables are `min_wait_time` (positive integer), `chosen_route` (i + 1), `s_i` and `d_i` (updated based on the next bus route values), `n` (unchanged), and `i` (incremented by 1). Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the next bus route values, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the next bus route values, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
