Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer. After the execution of the if statement, if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to be equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are modified based on the next bus route values, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases in the program execution.***
