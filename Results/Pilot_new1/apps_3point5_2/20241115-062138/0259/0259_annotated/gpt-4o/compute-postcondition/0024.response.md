Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the route with the minimum waiting time, `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of bus_routes[i]. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
