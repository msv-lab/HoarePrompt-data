The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` and `t` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5. Each bus route in the `bus_routes` list has a start time `s_i` and a time interval `d_i`, where 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5. The function returns the route number with the minimum waiting time based on the start time and time interval of each bus route in the `bus_routes` list.
