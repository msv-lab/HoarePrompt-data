Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list containing strings from 'one' to 'nine'; teens is a list containing strings from 'ten' to 'nineteen'; tens is a list containing strings from '', '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'. If s < 20, the code prints the string at index s-10 in the teens list. If 20 ≤ s ≤ 99, the code snippet prints the corresponding word representation of the input integer s. The postcondition covers all edge cases including when s is exactly 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, or 90.***
