The function func_1 accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and correctly converts it to its corresponding word representation using the `ones` and `tens` lists. If n is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of the number n from the `ones` list. If n is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation of the number from the 'teens' list at index n - 10. If n is between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer n if n % 10 == 0. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number n in words by combining the tens and ones place representations. The program accurately handles all edge cases and correctly converts the given integer n to its corresponding word representation.
