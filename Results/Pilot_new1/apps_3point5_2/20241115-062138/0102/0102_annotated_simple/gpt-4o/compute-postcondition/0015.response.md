Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of tens from empty string to ninety, n is not between 11 and 19 inclusive. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer 'n'. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` in words. The program correctly handles all edge cases and accurately converts the given integer `n` to its corresponding word representation.***
