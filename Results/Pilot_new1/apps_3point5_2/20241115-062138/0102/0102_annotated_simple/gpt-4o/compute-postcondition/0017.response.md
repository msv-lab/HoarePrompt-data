Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of tens from empty string to ninety. The program correctly converts the integer `n` to its corresponding word representation. If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the `ones` list. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number from the 'teens' list at index n - 10. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer `n` if n % 10 == 0. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` in words by combining the tens and ones place representations. The program accurately handles all edge cases and correctly converts the given integer `n` to its corresponding word representation.***
