Example Answer:
The list `teens` is initialized with strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen. The values in the list are fixed and will not change during the program's execution. Therefore, the Output State is: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen.
Output State: **s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen**
