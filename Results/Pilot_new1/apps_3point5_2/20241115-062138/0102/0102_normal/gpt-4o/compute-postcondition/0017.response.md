Postcondition: ***s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen; tens is a list of strings representing numbers from ten to ninety; n is an integer. If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the program returns the string representation of n from the ones list. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the program returns the string representation of n from the teens list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 == 0, the program returns the string representing the tens digit of n from the tens list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 != 0, the program concatenates the string representation of the tens digit of n from the tens list with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones digit of n from the ones list. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given input values of s and n, ensuring that the program handles all cases within the specified ranges and conditions.***
