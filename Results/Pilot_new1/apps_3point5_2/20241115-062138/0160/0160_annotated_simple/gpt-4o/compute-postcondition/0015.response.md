Output State: **If N is less than 2 or x is not a perfect square, the loop will not execute. If x is a perfect square and N is at least 2, the loop will iterate through the square root of x, checking for divisors. If x is divisible by the current value of i, both i and x // i will be added to the set of divisors. The final divisors set will contain all divisors of x.**
