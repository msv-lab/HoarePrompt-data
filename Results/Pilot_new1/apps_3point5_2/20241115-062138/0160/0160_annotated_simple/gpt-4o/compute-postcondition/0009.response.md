Postcondition: ***N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9, A_i are integers between 1 and 10^6, x is a perfect square greater than or equal to 1. If x % (i+1) == 0, divisors is a set containing divisors of x with the newly added divisors i+1 and x // (i+1). If x % i == 0, then divisors is updated to include i and x // i as additional divisors.***
