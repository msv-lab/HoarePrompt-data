Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`. The value of `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1**
