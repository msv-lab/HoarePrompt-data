Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates over all possible divisors of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The program uses the math module to calculate the gcd and iterate over the divisors efficiently. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
