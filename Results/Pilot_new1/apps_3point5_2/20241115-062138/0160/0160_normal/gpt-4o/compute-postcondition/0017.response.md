The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 500. After executing the function body, the program returns the set `divisors` sorted in descending order. The `divisors` set is a set of integers that divide `x` without leaving a remainder. The integers in the `divisors` set are sorted in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` within the specified range and return a set of its divisors sorted in descending order.
