According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is between 1 and 500, `K` is between 0 and 10^9, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current gcd and the value of A at index i+1, i is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to `i is between 2 and N` since the loop starts from 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is between 1 and 500, K is between 0 and 10^9, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current gcd and the value of A at index i+1, i is between 2 and N**
