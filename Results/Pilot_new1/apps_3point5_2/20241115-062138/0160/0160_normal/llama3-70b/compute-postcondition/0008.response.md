Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the value of `A` at index `i+1`. The initial state does not provide the values of `A` or the current `gcd`, so the output state is: N is between 1 and 500, K is between 0 and 10^9, and `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the value of `A` at index `i+1`.
Output State: **N is between 1 and 500, K is between 0 and 10^9, and `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the value of `A` at index `i+1`**
