According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, and `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `max_divisor` and `gcd` need to be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.

State: **`max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1**
