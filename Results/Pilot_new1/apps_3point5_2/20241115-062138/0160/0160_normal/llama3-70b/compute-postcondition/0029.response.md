According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop for the next iteration.
- Since `i` is incremented by 1, the loop condition `i <= int(math.sqrt(gcd))` should still hold true. Therefore, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.

State: **`max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is updated to `i + 1`**
