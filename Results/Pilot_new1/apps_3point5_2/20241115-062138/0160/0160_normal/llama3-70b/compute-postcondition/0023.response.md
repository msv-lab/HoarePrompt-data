Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` and `gcd` are perfect squares greater than or equal to 1, `K` is any value between 0 and 10^9, `i` is incremented by 1. If `gcd` modulo `i` is 0, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct behavior of the program.***
