Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values N and K, followed by a list of integers A. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A. After that, it finds the largest factor of the gcd that is less than or equal to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor obtained. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it processes the input data as described.**
