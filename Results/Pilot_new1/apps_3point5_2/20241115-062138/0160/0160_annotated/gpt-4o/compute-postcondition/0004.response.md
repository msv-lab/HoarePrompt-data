Example Answer: 
After executing the code, the value `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The initial value of `i` is 1, and based on the initial state, `x` is a value such that int(math.sqrt(x)) is greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `divisors` is a set that contains the factors of `x` and the value of `x // i`, `x` is a value such that int(math.sqrt(x)) is greater than 0, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains the factors of `x` and the value of `x // i`, `x` is a value such that int(math.sqrt(x)) is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
