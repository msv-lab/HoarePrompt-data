According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x`, `x // 1`, and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, where `i` is the next integer after the previous `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `i` should be considered, which means adjusting the `divisors` set to include factors of `x`, `x // 1`, and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i+1`. 
State: **`divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x`, `x // 1`, and `x // (i+1)` if `x` is divisible by `i+1`**
