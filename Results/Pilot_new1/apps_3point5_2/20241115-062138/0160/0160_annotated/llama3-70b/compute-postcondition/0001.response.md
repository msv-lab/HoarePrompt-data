Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the input split by space to integers. The values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` and `K` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space, `A` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`N` and `K` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space, `A` is a list of integers**
