Postcondition: ***N, K are assigned values obtained from input, A is a list of integers with at least 1 element, gcd is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A and is greater than or equal to 3, i is at least 3. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum of the current value and gcd divided by i. In all cases, max_divisor is updated to the maximum of the current value and 3.***
