Output State: **`N` and `K` are assigned values obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`, `i` is at least 1. If `N` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains the same as the initial value, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`**
