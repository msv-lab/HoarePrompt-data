Example Answer:
The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current value of `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `i` is at least 3, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_divisor` and 3. Therefore, the Output State is: `N`, `K` are assigned values obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A` and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 3, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current value and 3.
Output State: **`N`, `K` are assigned values obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A` and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 3, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current value and 3**
