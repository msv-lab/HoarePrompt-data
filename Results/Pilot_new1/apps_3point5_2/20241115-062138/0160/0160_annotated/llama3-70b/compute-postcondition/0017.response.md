Postcondition: ***`N`, `K` are assigned values obtained from input, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A` and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` where `max_divisor` is divisible by `i`. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
