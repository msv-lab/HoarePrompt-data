Example Answer:
`a` is assigned a list of integers obtained by mapping the input values split by space to integers. The value of `n` is an input integer, so after execution, `a` will contain a list of integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
