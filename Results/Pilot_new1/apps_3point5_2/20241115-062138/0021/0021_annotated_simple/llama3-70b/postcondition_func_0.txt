The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, the minimum distance between these positions, and prints the maximum of these two distances. The function assumes `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not have a specified return value.
