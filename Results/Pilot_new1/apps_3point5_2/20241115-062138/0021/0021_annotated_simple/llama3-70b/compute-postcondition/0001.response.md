Example Answer:
The list `a` is reassigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input consists of n distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, after execution, the list `a` will contain n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**
