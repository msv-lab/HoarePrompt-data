Example Answer:
The maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn` is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the positions and subtracting 1. If this value is less than `n-2`, then it is updated to `n-2`. The previous values of `pos1` and `posn` are 0 and n-1 respectively. Therefore, the maximum distance is calculated as `max(abs(0 - (n-1)) - 1, n - 2)`, which simplifies to `max(n-1 - 1, n - 2)` or `max(n-2, n - 2)` which is `n-2`. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n-1, and `max_dist` is n-2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n-1, and `max_dist` is n-2**
