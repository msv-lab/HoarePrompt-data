Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, where `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`. The value of `min_pos` ranges from 0 to n-1, so the value of `dist3` ranges from 0 to n-1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is 99, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and `max_pos`, `dist3` is an integer within the range 0 to n-1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is 99, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and `max_pos`, `dist3` is an integer within the range 0 to n-1**
