Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is within the range 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Since `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of `n` in `a` will be `n-1`. Therefore, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1**
