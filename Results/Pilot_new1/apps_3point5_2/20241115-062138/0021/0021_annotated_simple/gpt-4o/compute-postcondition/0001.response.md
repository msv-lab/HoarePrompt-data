Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the input values after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input consists of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, so the list `a` now contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
