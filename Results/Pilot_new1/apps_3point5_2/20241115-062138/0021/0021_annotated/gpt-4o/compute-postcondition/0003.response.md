Example Answer: 
`max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. Since `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, `n` is the maximum value in list `a`, so `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`. The index of `n` in list `a` is already known as `n` is an input integer, so `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`**
