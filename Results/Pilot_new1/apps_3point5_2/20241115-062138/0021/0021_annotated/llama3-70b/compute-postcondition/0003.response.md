Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index()` method. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state is: `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present).
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present)**
