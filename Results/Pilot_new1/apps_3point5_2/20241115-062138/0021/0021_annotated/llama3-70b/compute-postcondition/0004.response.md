Example Answer: 
`max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. The values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not specified, so the output state is: `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present), and `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a` (if 1 is present), and `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance**
