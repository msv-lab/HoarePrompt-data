Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers n and k, calculates the value of 'x' using a formula involving n, k, and the math module, and returns the result. **

The code initializes a multiplier based on 10 raised to the power of k, then calculates x using n, the multiplier, and the greatest common divisor function from the math module. The function returns the calculated value of x. It is essential to note that the code relies on the math module for the greatest common divisor calculation, so it is assumed that the math module is imported for the function to work correctly.
