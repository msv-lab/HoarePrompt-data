According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition needs to be true. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is increased by 1 and `(n % x)` is equal to 0. Therefore, to satisfy the loop condition, `n` needs to be increased further by 1 so that `(n % x)` becomes not equal to 0.
State: **`n` is increased by 2, `(n % x)` is not equal to 0, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
