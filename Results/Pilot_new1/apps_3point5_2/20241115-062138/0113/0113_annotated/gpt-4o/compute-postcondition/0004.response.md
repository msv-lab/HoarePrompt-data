Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function calculates the result of n multiplied by (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), where multiplier is derived from the formula 10^k. The function then returns this calculated result. It is important to note that the annotation mentions a variable `multiplier` without explicit definition, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. **
