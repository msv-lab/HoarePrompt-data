The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function returns the value of x, which is a multiple of n based on the multiplier value k. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers n and k, and return the value of x, which is a multiple of n based on the multiplier value k.
