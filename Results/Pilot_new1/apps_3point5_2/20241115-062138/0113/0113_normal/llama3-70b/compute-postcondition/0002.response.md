Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer. Since `x` is calculated as 10 to the power of `k`, the value of `x` remains the same. Therefore, after execution, `n` is the previous positive integer incremented by 1, `k` remains the same non-negative integer, and `x` is still 10 to the power of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 10 to the power of `k`**
