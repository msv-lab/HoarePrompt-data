Example Answer:
`n` is incremented by 1, where the initial value of `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the updated value of `n` is a positive integer as well. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. After execution, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 7, `k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `x` is 10 to the power of the updated `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 7, `k` is a non-negative integer incremented by 1, `x` is 10 to the power of the updated `k`**
