The value of `numerator` is assigned the result of `numerator // gcd`. Given that `numerator` is 0 and `gcd` is \(2^k\), the result of the integer division `0 // (2^k)` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is \(2^k\), `gcd` is \(2^k\).

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is \(2^k\), `gcd` is \(2^k\)**
