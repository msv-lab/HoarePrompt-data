According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and it needs to remain less than `k`. Since `k` is at least 2, it will still be valid for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables (`n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, `denominator`) do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 2**
