The `print(1, 1)` statement outputs the values `1` and `1` to the console. The variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` are not affected by this print statement. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for those variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`; the function prints 1, 1.**
