The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The value of `denominator` is previously defined as (2^n)^k % MOD. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the product of (2^n - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo MOD; `denominator` is (2^n)^k % MOD; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is (2^n)^k % MOD.
