The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The value of `p_total` is already defined in the initial state, so `B` takes on that value. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is (2^n)^k % MOD, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.

Output State: **`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is (2^n)^k % MOD, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
