The value of `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` is (2^n)^k, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. After the operation, `denominator` will be reduced, but the specific new value cannot be determined without the actual values of `gcd`, `numerator`, and `denominator`. The state of `numerator` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; `numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`, and `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`.

Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; `numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`, and `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`.**
