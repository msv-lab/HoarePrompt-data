The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer that can range from 1 to 10^18. The other variable `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.**
