The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\), and computes the numerator and denominator based on the given `k`. It returns a tuple containing the reduced numerator modulo \(10^6 + 3\) and the reduced denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), the calculation may lead to negative values in the numerator. The function does not handle cases where `k` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
