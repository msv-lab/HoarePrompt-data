To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the operation.

1. The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
2. The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
3. The variable `g` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(A, B)`.
4. The operation `A //= g` means that `A` is updated to be the result of integer division of its current value by `g`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `p_shared`, `p_total`, and the return value of `func_1(A, B)`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `A` after the operation. However, we can state that `A` is modified based on the integer division of its previous value by `g`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `A` and the values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `p_no_shared` is assigned the value 1; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`**.
