The code assigns a value to the variable `MOD`, which is calculated as \(10^6 + 3\). The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. The value of `MOD` becomes \(1000003\). Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `MOD` is 1000003.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003**
