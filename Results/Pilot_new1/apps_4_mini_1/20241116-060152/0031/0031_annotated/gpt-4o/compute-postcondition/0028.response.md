The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns None. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the behavior of the function is not specified within this fragment. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds 2 raised to the power of `n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns None. The behavior for the case where `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n` is not defined. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, prints (1, 1) and returns None if k is greater than 2 raised to the power of n. The behavior is unspecified if k is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of n.**
