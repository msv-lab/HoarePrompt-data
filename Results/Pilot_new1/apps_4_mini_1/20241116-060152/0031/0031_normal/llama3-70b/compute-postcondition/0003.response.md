According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting from `i = 0` to `i = k - 1`. Given that `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 2. 

The current state indicates that `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, but the value of `i` needs to be initialized at the start of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the state of `i` should be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
