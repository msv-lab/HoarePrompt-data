The code assigns the value `10 ** 6 + 3` to the variable `MOD`. This calculation results in `MOD` being equal to `1000003`. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003**
