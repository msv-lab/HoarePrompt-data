Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`. It outputs (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), it calculates and prints two values derived from the numerator and denominator based on combinatorial calculations, which are then reduced by their greatest common divisor. The specific calculations involve modular arithmetic with a modulus of \(10^6 + 3\). **
