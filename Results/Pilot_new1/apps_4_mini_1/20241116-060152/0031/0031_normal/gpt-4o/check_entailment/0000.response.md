To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and the output hints for both functions.

### Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the probability that at least two of `k` people interviewed have the same birthday among `2^n` possible days. The output must be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime. The function must also handle large numbers and perform calculations modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Function Analysis:

#### Function 1: GCD Calculation
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```
- **Output Description**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two integers. The description aligns with the code, and it handles the case where `b` is 0 properly.

#### Function 2: Probability Calculation
```python
def func_2(n, k):
    MOD = 10 ** 6 + 3
    if k > 1 << n:
        print(1, 1)
        return
    total_days = 1 << n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD
        denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
    p_no_shared = numerator
    p_total = denominator
    p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
    A = p_shared
    B = p_total
    g = func_1(A, B)
    A //= g
    B //= g
    print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
```
- **Output Description**: This function handles the cases as specified in the problem statement. If `k` is greater than \( 2^n \), it outputs (1, 1) correctly. For cases where \( k \leq 2^n \), it calculates the probability using combinatorial logic, maintains modular arithmetic, and reduces the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) using the GCD.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case where `k` is exactly equal to \( 2^n \)**: The code handles this because it will calculate the probability correctly without going out of bounds.
2. **Case where `k` is 1**: The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday should be 0, which is not directly addressed in the output but is implicitly handled since \( A \) would be 0 if no shared birthdays are possible.
3. **Very large values of `n` and `k`**: The code must handle large integers, and Python's integer type can manage this, but there might be performance considerations.

### Output Hints Agreement:
- The output hints for both functions match their respective code functionalities.
- The hints indicate that the GCD is computed correctly, and the probability calculations are performed accurately under the conditions specified.

### Conclusion:
The code adheres to the problem description and handles the edge cases appropriately. The calculations for the probability are done correctly, and the output format is maintained as required. 

Thus, after thorough analysis, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
