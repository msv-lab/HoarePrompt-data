The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as `s[0]`, `i` is 0, and `shares` is less than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
