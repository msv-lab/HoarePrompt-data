The `sort()` method is called on the list `s`, which means that the elements of `s` will be sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged, but the order of the elements in `s` will change based on its initial values. Since `s` is a list of `n` integers from input, the output state will reflect that `s` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of n integers, `b` is a list of integers from input**
