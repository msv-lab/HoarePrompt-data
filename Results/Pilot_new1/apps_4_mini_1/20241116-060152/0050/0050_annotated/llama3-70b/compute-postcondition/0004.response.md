The list `b` is sorted in reverse order, meaning the largest integers will come first. The previous values of `b` are not specified, but they will now be arranged from largest to smallest. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorting of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of n integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order**
