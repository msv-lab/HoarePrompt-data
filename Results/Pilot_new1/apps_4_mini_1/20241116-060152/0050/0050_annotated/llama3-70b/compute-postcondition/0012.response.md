Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, and `shares` is updated accordingly. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, then `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[0]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[0]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop breaks, and no changes are made to `shares` or `r`. This captures the scenario where `r` is either sufficient to yield shares or not enough to continue the operation.***
