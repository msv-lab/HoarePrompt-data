The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of which we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as `s[0]`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is less than `m` (specifically `i` is incremented by 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
