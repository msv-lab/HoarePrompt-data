The list `s` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated input of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts each split string into an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the list `s` is now populated with the integers provided in the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of integers based on the input**
