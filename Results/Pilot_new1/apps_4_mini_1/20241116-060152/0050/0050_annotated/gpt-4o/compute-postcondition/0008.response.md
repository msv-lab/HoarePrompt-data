The variable `max_shares` is assigned the value of `r // min_buy_price`, where `r` is an input integer and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `b`, and the lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, and `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, and `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.**
