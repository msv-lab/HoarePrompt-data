The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the input string into integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, as they are set based on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that these variables now hold new integer values based on the input while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers**
