The code initializes `s` as a list of integers obtained from user input, where the input is split into separate string elements and then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with the new list `s` that contains integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers from input**
