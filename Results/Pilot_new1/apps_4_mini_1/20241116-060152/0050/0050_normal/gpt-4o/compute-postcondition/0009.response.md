To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line of code on the variables defined in the initial state.

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n`: an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30
   - `m`: an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30
   - `r`: an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000
   - `s`: a list of integers from input
   - `b`: a list of integers from input
   - `min_buy_price`: the minimum value from the list `s`
   - `max_sell_price`: the maximum value from the list `b`
   - `max_shares`: calculated as `r // min_buy_price`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line of code `remaining_bourles = r % min_buy_price` calculates the remainder of `r` when divided by `min_buy_price`. This means `remaining_bourles` will hold the leftover amount of money after buying as many shares as possible at the minimum buy price.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, and `max_shares` remain unchanged.
   - The new variable `remaining_bourles` is introduced, which is calculated based on the values of `r` and `min_buy_price`.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since we don't have specific values for `r` and `min_buy_price`, we can't determine the exact value of `remaining_bourles`, but we can state that it is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
