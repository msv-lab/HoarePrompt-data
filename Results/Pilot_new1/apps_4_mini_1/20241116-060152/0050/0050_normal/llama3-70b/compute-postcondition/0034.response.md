The assignment `shares = 0` sets the value of `shares` to 0. However, `shares` was already 0 in the initial state, so there is no change in its value. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, and `r`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `r` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `r` remains unchanged**
