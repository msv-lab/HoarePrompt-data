The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The value of `b` is derived from input, so it can contain any integers. The state of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `min_buy_price`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the new variable `max_sell_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.**
