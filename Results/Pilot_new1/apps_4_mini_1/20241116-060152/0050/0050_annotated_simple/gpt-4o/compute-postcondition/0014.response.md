Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `n` is the number of buying prices, `m` is the number of selling prices, and `r` is the amount of money available for buying shares. It also accepts two lists of integers: `s`, which contains the buying prices, and `b`, which contains the selling prices. The function calculates the minimum buying price from list `s` and the maximum selling price from list `b`. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` using the minimum buying price, computes the remaining money after buying as `remaining_bourles`, and then calculates the total amount of money that can be obtained by selling those shares at the maximum selling price plus any remaining money. Finally, it prints the total amount of bourles. The function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where the prices could be negative or zero, which may lead to unexpected behavior.**
