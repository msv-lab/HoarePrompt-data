The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` is 0, and `shares` is not greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
