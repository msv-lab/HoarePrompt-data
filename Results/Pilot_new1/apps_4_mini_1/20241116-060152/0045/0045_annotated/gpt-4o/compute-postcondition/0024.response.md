Output State: **If `remainder` is greater than 0 and `k` is at least 1, then `sequence` is updated such that `sequence[i]` is incremented for `i` from `k - 1` down to `k - (r - 1)` where `r` is the number of times the loop executes, and `remainder` is decreased by `r`. If `remainder` is 0 before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and `sequence` remains as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`, with `remainder` unchanged.**
