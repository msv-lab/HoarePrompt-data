The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The value of `min_sum` is calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but they are both positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^10. Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `min_sum` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
