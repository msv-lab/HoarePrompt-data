The `remainder` variable is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `sequence[i]` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder` while maintaining the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 for `i` in the range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `k - 2.**
