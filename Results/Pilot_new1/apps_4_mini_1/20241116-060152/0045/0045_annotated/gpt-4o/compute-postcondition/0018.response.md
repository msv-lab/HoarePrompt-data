To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the for loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`. This indicates that the loop starts at `i = k - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

2. At the end of the previous iteration, the state indicates that `i` was `k - 2`. Given that the loop decrements `i`, the next value of `i` will be `k - 3`.

3. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least `3` (since `k` is greater than or equal to `2`, `k - 1` must be at least `1`, allowing for at least two iterations).

4. The state mentions that `k` is greater than or equal to `2`, which is sufficient for the loop to execute again. The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration needs to be adjusted to `k - 3`.

5. The other variables in the state (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustments to the state are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 for `i` in the range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 3, and `i` is `k - 3`**
