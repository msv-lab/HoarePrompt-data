The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, the function calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum sum required exceeds the given integer `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, implying that the conditions are satisfied for further processing.

In Case 2, the function returns an updated list called 'sequence' based on the conditions of 'remainder' and 'k'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the minimum sum required is feasible, and either return -1 if it exceeds `n` or proceed to return an updated list based on further conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If the conditions are satisfied, it returns an updated list 'sequence'.**
