Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is 0 initially, it returns `a` without any computation. If `b` is greater than 0, it continues to compute the GCD until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the GCD. **
