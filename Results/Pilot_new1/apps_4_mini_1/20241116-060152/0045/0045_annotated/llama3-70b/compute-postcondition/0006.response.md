Initial State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10.

Code of the loop:
```
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, with `a` being the initial value of `n` and `b` being the initial value of `k`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `a` is not a multiple of `b`. The values of `a` and `b` have changed, and `b` is still greater than 0.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `b` is greater than 0, indicating that the loop continues.

The loop will terminate when `b` becomes 0. If the initial value of `k` is 1, the loop will execute once, and `b` will become 0 on the next iteration. If both `n` and `k` are equal, the loop will execute until `b` becomes 0, resulting in `a` being the GCD of the initial values of `n` and `k`.

If either `n` or `k` is 0 (which is not in the initial state as per constraints), the loop would not execute at all, and `a` would remain unchanged from its initial value.

Output State: **`if b (initially k) is greater than 0, then a is the GCD of n and k and b is 0 at the end. If b is 0 initially, the loop doesn't execute and a remains n.`**
