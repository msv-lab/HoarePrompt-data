The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. However, since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine their specific values after execution. 

The output state will reflect that `a` and `b` have been updated based on their initial values, but we cannot specify what those values are. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the result of `a % b`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the result of `a % b`**
