The values of `a` and `b` are updated simultaneously. The new value of `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is assigned the result of `a % b` (the modulus of `a` divided by `b`). Since `b` is not zero, the modulus operation is valid.

Let's denote the previous values of `a` and `b` as `a_prev` and `b_prev`. After the execution:
- `a` will be equal to `b_prev`
- `b` will be equal to `a_prev % b_prev`

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, and `b` is updated to the result of `a_prev % b_prev`.

Output State: **`a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, `b` is updated to the result of `a_prev % b_prev**
