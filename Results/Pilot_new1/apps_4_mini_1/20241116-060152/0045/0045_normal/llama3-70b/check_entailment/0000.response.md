To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements thoroughly.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized. If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis
1. The first check `if n < k:` is to determine if it's even possible to create a sequence of `k` numbers that sum to `n`. This condition is valid since the smallest `k` positive integers (1 through `k`) sum to `k * (k + 1) / 2`, which must be less than or equal to `n`.

2. The loop `for i in range(1, k + 1):` attempts to build the sequence by appending the first `k` integers to `seq` as long as `n` is sufficient to cover the sum.

3. After building the sequence, the check `if len(seq) != k:` verifies if the sequence has the desired length. If not, it outputs `-1`.

4. Finally, the sequence is printed if it meets the required conditions.

### Edge Cases
- If `n` is exactly equal to `k`, the output should be `1 2 ... k` which sums to `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and this is valid.
- If `n` is less than the sum of the first `k` integers, it should correctly output `-1`.

### Potential Issues
The code does not seem to account for maximizing the GCD of the sequence. The output hints suggest that the GCD is not being explicitly calculated or enforced in the current logic of the program.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe the function for calculating the GCD, but they do not address how the program constructs the sequence to ensure that the GCD is maximized. The hints imply that the GCD function is unrelated to the main logic of creating the sequence, which is a critical aspect of the problem description.

### Conclusion
The program does not fulfill the requirement of maximizing the GCD of the sequence. It simply constructs the first `k` integers, which does not guarantee that the GCD of the sequence is maximized. 

For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, while the program may produce `1 2 3`, a better sequence maximizing the GCD could be `2 4 6` (GCD = 2).

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem's requirements for all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
