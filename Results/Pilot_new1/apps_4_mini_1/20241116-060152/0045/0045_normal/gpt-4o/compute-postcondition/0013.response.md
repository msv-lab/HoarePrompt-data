According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be `0` for the loop to execute again. 

Given that `i` is currently `0`, the loop will not execute again because the range will be exhausted. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `-1`. 

Since `k` is greater than `0`, the loop can only execute if `i` starts from `k - 1` and decrements. Thus, we need to ensure that `k` remains the same and that `i` is adjusted to `-1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged, `i` is -1**
