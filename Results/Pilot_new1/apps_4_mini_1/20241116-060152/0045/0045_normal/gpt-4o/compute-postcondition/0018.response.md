According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the condition set by `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, which means the loop has already completed its iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `k` is greater than 0, this condition is already satisfied).

Since `i` is currently -1, it needs to be set to 0 for the loop to execute again. The other states do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly impacted by the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged with `i` being 0.**
