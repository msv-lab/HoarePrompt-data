To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial conditions and the code provided. 

1. We know that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is also a positive integer.
2. The variable `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
3. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. However, since the code snippet provided does not include any return statement, we will assume that `min_sum` is not greater than `n` for the execution of the code snippet to proceed.
4. The code snippet `d = n // min_sum` assigns the value of `n` divided by `min_sum` (using integer division) to the variable `d`.

Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `k`, we cannot compute exact values for `min_sum` and `d`. However, we can express the relationships based on the provided conditions.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculations performed:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, and `d` is calculated as n // min_sum**.
