The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1, but the previous value of `remainder` is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged.
