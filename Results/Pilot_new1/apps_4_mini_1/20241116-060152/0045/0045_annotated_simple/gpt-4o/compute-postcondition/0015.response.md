Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the loop continues to execute.***
