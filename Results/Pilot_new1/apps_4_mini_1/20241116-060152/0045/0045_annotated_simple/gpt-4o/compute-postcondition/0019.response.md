The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
