To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration and the conditions of the for loop.

1. The loop is structured as `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it starts from `k - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `0`. 
2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, we need to adjust `i` to reflect its new value for the next iteration.

Given that `i` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration, we need to set `i` to `k - 2` to ensure the loop can execute again. 

Now, let's summarize the states:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `k` remains a positive integer.
- `min_sum` remains calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` remains assigned the value `n // min_sum`.
- `remainder` is still decremented by 1.
- `sequence[i]` was incremented by 1, so we need to adjust `i` to `k - 2` for the next iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be adjusted to `k - 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`.**
