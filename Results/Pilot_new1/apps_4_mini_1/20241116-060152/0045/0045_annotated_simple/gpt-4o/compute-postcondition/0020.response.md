Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that no further iterations will occur; otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking.***
