Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` integers. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, it computes a sequence of `k` integers that sum up to `n`, where the first `k` integers are scaled by a factor `d`, and any remaining value is distributed among the elements of the sequence. The function ultimately returns this sequence. **
