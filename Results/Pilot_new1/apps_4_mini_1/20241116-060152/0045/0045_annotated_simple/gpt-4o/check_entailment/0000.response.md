To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Understanding
The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized. If no such sequence exists, the program should return `-1`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
   ```
   This calculates the minimum sum required for the first `k` positive integers (1 through k). If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, then it is impossible to form such a sequence, and the function correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Determining the GCD**:
   ```python
   d = n // min_sum
   remainder = n - d * min_sum
   ```
   Here, `d` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. This value `d` will be used to scale the sequence of the first `k` integers. The `remainder` represents how much more we need to add to reach `n`.

3. **Creating the Sequence**:
   ```python
   sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
   ```
   This creates the initial sequence as `[d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k]`. This sequence will have a GCD of `d`.

4. **Adjusting the Sequence**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
       if remainder == 0:
           break
       
       sequence[i] += 1
       remainder -= 1
   ```
   The loop attempts to distribute the `remainder` across the sequence elements, starting from the last element and moving backward. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   Finally, the sequence is returned.

### Potential Issues
The code seems to handle the basic cases correctly. However, let's consider edge cases and whether it handles all scenarios:

- **Case when `k` is greater than `n`**:
  For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the function will compute `min_sum = 3`, which is greater than `n`. The function will return `-1`, which is correct.

- **Case when `n` is less than `min_sum`**:
  This is already handled as the program returns `-1`.

- **Case when `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum`**:
  For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, `min_sum` is also `3`, and the function will return `[1, 2]`, which is correct.

- **Case when `n` is large**: 
  For larger values of `n` and `k`, the program should still work as it constructs the sequence based on the calculated `d` and adjusts with the `remainder`.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no scenarios where it fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
