To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If no sequence can be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

1. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct because you cannot form `k` positive integers that sum to `n` if `n` is less than `k`.
   
2. **Generating the Sequence**: The program then attempts to create a sequence by appending numbers from `1` to `k`. It subtracts each appended number from `n`. This loop continues until it can no longer append a number without exceeding `n`.

3. **Final Check**: After the loop, if the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`.

### Issues:
- The program does not ensure that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximal. The sequence generated is simply the first `k` positive integers, which may not yield the maximum GCD.
- For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program would output `1 2 3`, which sums to `6` and has a GCD of `1`. However, a better sequence would be `2 4 6`, which sums to `12` and has a GCD of `2`, which is maximal.
  
### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 12` and `k = 3`:
- The output would be `1 2 3`, which is not the optimal sequence. The output should ideally be `2 4 6` for a maximal GCD of `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to always produce a sequence with the maximal GCD, which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, it does not meet the correctness criteria.

Correctness: **False**.
