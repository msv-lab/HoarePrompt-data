Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if the first number is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it is treated as '0'. The function handles very large numbers by comparing their string representations directly, ensuring that all edge cases, including leading zeros and empty inputs, are properly addressed. **
