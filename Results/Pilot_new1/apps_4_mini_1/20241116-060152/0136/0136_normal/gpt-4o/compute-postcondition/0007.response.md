The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `b` was an empty string. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0'**
