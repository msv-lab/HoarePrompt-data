Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers as input (as strings), removes any leading zeroes, and compares them. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, and '>' if the first number is greater than the second. It does not return any values, and it relies on standard input and output for interaction. **
