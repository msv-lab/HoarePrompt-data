Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; otherwise, the output is '>'. This accounts for all cases where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, including the scenario where `a` and `b` differ in length, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.***
