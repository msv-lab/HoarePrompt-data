The code `data = input().split()` takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The variables `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this code, but `data` will now hold the split parts of the input. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, they will be part of the input and will be stored in the `data` list.

The output state reflects that `data` now contains the split representation of the input, which could include `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, and `data` contains the split input values.**
