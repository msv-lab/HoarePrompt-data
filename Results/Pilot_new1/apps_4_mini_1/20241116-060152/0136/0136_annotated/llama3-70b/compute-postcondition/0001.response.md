The value of `b` is assigned the result of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes in the input string will be removed. Since `b` is initially a non-negative integer represented as a string, it may have leading zeroes. The value of `a` remains unchanged. After execution, `b` will either be an empty string (if the input was all zeroes) or a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeroes. 

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed**
