Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings derived from the first two elements of `data` with leading zeros removed; if either was originally empty, it is set to '0'. After execution, if the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output will be '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, or '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. In all cases, if `b` was empty before execution, it will be '0' after execution.***
