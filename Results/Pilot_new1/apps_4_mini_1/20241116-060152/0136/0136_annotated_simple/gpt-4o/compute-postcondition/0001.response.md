The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial value of `a` is a non-negative integer string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. The new value of `a` will depend on the first string in `data` after removing any leading zeros. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the first string in `data` with leading zeros removed, `b` is a non-negative integer string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
