The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may include leading zeros and can each have up to 10^6 digits. The function performs operations on these string representations of numbers and returns a result based on the comparison or manipulation of these numbers. Since the specific output is not provided, we can summarize the functionality based on the parameters alone.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, potentially containing leading zeros, and each can have up to 10^6 digits.**
