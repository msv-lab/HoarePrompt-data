The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts two integers separated by a space, and `map(int, input().split())` converts them to integers. The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, so the values of `x` and `y` will be within this range after execution. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now specific integers within the given constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
