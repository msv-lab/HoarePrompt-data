The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the result based on the values of `x` and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we can denote `d = x - y`, which is a positive integer. The calculation involves two parts: the integer division of `d` by 2, and the remainder of `d` when divided by 2. 

This means:
- `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of pairs of integers that can be formed from the difference.
- `(x - y) % 2` accounts for an additional integer if `d` is odd.

Thus, the output state will include the values of `x`, `y`, and the result of the calculation. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but we can state the relationship.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the result is calculated as (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
