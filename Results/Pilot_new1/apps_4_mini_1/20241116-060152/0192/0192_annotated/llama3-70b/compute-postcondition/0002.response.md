The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters; however, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return values or behavior based on the constraints alone. Therefore, we can only summarize the accepted parameters based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates with integers x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific return value is not provided.**
