The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which is calculated as `abs(x - y)`. Given the initial state that `y` is less than `x`, the absolute difference will be `x - y`. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but they are integers satisfying the conditions 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. Thus, the output state will reflect that the absolute difference is calculated based on these constraints.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(x - y)**
