The function accepts two integers, x and y, from user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints this difference. It does not return any value. The function does not enforce the constraints mentioned in the annotations (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000), and it will accept any integers provided by the user, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the constraints are not met.
