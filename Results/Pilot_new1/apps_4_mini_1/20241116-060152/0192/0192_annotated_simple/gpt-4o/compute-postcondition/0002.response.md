The function `func` does not have any parameters explicitly provided in the function definition. However, based on the constraints given, it can be inferred that the function operates on two integers, `x` and `y`, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`. The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided output section. 

Therefore, due to the lack of information about the output or return value of the function, I cannot provide a detailed description of its functionality. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but operates on integers x and y with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The return value is not specified.**
