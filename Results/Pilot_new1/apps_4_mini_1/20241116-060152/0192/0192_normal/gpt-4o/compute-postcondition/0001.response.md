The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the result based on the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x - y` is a positive integer since `y < x`. The first part, `(x - y) // 2`, computes the integer division of `x - y` by 2, while the second part, `(x - y) % 2`, computes the remainder when `x - y` is divided by 2. 

Since `x` and `y` are new integers based on input such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), the output state will reflect that the result is derived from the inputs but does not specify the exact values of `x` and `y`. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are new integers based on input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the result of the expression is calculated.**
