The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the initial state where `x` and `y` are integers satisfying the condition \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer since \(x\) is greater than \(y\). Therefore, the output state will include the values of `x`, `y`, and the calculated absolute difference.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers assigned from input, maintaining the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; abs(x - y) is a positive integer.**
