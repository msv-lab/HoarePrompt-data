The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers, with the conditions that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. However, since the function does not take any parameters directly, it implies that `x` and `y` must be defined or set within the function's scope or through some external means. 

The output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, without knowing the specific return values or actions taken by the function, we cannot definitively describe its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
