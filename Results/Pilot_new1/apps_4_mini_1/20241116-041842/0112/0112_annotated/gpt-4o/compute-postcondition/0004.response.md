According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, inclusive. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration. Since `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. 

For the loop to execute correctly at the start:
- The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, representing the first iteration of the loop.
- The other states (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, and `found`) do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as they do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` is now 0.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0**
