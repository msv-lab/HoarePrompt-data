Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, and `i` is n. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, the state of `used_cubes` and `found` remains unchanged.***
