Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where `used_cubes[i]` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is True indicating that a match was found, and `i` is still 0. If `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]` or `used_cubes[i]` is already True, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` remains False, and `i` remains 0.***
