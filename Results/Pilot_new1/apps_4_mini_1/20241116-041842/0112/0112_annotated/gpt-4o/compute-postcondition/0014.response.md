Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, and `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, no changes are made to `used_cubes` or `found`.***
