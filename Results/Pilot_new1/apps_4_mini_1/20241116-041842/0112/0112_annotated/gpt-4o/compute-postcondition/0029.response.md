According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the `digits` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` is the next element in the `digits` list, and `index` has been incremented to point to the next element (index + 1). 

To execute the loop one more time, `index` must be less than the length of the `digits` list. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `index` is now pointing to the next element, and `digit` should be updated to the element at the new `index`.

State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` may have been modified, `digit` is the element at the new index in the digits list, `index` is incremented to point to the next element in the list (index + 1)**
