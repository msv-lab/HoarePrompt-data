The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `cubes`, where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9. It attempts to determine the maximum integer `x` such that the function `can_form_number` returns True for all numbers from 1 to `x`. If `can_form_number(1)` returns False, the function immediately returns 0. If `can_form_number` returns True for the numbers 1, 2, or 3, the function will return that corresponding value (1, 3, or 5). However, if `can_form_number` fails for any subsequent number, it will return the last successful value of `x`. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `n` is outside the expected range or where `cubes` are empty or malformed.
