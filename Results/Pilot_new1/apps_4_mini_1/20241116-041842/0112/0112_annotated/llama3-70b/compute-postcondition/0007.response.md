According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute once for each list in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, and `cube` is the second list in `cubes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 3 lists, and `cube` must be the third list in `cubes`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of the elements in `cube`.**
