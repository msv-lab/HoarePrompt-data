According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list (i.e., it should not be empty). Since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we can infer that `cubes` should contain at least one list when `n` is 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `cube` will represent the current list from `cubes`. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `cubes` must contain at least one list, and `cube` should be the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
