Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False. If `found` is True, it indicates that there exists an index `i` such that `0 â‰¤ i < n`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, or if `digits` is an empty list, `used_cubes` remains unchanged as a list of False values, and `found` remains False.***
