The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be an index that is within the range of the list `used_cubes`, which has a length of 3. Therefore, after executing this line, one of the elements in `used_cubes` will be set to `True`, but we do not know the specific index `i`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one of its elements set to True**
