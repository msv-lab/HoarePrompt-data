The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one of its elements set to True, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
