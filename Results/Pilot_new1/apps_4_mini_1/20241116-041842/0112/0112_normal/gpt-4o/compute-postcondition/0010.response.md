According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. Since the loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, if `i` is currently at the maximum value it can take (which is `n-1`), then it will not be able to execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `n` is at most 3, if `i` is currently 2, then `n` must be adjusted to be at least 3. If `i` is 1, then `n` must be at least 2. If `i` is 0, then `n` can remain as is (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3).

However, we also know that `used_cubes` remains unchanged if the conditions are not met. Therefore, we need to specify the necessary adjustments to ensure the loop can run again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with False**
