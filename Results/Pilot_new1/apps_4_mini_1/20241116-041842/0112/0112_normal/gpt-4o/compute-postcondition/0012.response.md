The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the previous values of `n`, `digits`, or `used_cubes`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one index set to True and the rest remain False, and `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one index set to True and the rest remain False, and `found` is True**
