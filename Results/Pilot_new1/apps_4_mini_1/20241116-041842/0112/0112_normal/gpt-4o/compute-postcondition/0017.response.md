The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `digits`, or `used_cubes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `found`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one of its elements set to True, and `found` is True**
