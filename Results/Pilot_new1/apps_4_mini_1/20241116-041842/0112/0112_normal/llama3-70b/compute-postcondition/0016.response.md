The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input parameters. However, it operates based on the constraints provided: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of `n` lists, each containing exactly 6 integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 9.

Given the output constraints, the function's behavior can be inferred. Since the specific output behavior is not provided, we can summarize that it will process the input structure of `cubes` based on the defined constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers that meet the specified criteria regarding their number and range.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists called `cubes`, where the number of sublists is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each sublist contains exactly 6 integers in the range 0 to 9.**
