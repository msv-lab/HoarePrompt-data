The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, so after execution, `n` will hold a value between 1 and 3. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects this.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
