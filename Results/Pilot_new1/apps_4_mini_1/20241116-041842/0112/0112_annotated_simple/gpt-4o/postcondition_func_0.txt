The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` lists, each with exactly 6 integers ranging from 0 to 9. It returns the largest integer `x` such that the function `can_form_number(x)` returns True. If `can_form_number(1)` is false, the function returns 0, indicating that no valid number can be formed. The value of `x` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the results of `can_form_number`.
