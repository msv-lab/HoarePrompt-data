Output State: **If `n` is between 1 and 3 and `digits` contains digits that match any of the integers in `cube_faces`, then `used_cubes` will have some values set to True corresponding to the indices of the `cube_faces` lists that matched the digits, and `found` will be True for those iterations. If `digits` contains a digit that does not match any of the `cube_faces` lists, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` will be False. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop does not execute, resulting in `used_cubes` remaining a list of length `n` with all values set to False and `found` remaining False. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.**
