The value at index `i` of the `used_cubes` list is set to `True`. The previous value of `used_cubes[i]` is unchanged, but the specific value before the assignment is not provided. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is 3, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` has `True` at index `i`, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, and `digit` is the first element in `digits`.
