According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again since `i` is currently 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since the values of `cube_faces`, `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `digit` do not affect whether the loop can execute again based on the loop's control variables.

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the value at index `i` unchanged, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, and `digit` is the first element in `digits`.**
