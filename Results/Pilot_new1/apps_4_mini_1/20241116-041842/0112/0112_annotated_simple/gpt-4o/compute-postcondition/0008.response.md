The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length n with the value at index `i` set to True, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
