The code creates a list called `cubes`, which is populated by taking `n` inputs from the user. Each input consists of space-separated integers that are mapped to integers. The value of `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, which determines how many lists will be created in `cubes`. The previous values of `n` do not affect the state of other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers from user input.**
