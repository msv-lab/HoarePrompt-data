The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Since `total_sum` is initially 0, the new value of `total_sum` becomes `num % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected, and since `num` is equal to `l`, the output state reflects that. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, and `num` is `l`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`**
