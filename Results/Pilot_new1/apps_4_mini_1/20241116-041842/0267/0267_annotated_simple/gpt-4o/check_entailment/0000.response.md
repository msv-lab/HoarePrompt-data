To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

The program consists of two functions:

1. **func_1(n, k)**: This function checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`. It converts the number to a string, creates a set of its characters (digits), and compares the length of that set to `k`. This part of the code seems correct as it accurately counts the unique digits in `n`.

2. **func_2(l, r, k)**: This function calculates the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that have at most `k` different digits. It initializes `total_sum` to zero and iterates through each number in the range `[l, r]`. For each number, it uses `func_1(num, k)` to check if the number meets the digit condition. If it does, it adds the number to `total_sum`, applying modulo `MOD` to keep the result manageable.

However, there are some critical issues in the implementation:

- The program uses a loop to iterate from `l` to `r`, which is not feasible for the upper limits of the input constraints (up to \(10^{18}\)). A direct iteration would take an impractically long time and is not efficient.
- The program does not handle the case where `MOD` is defined; it should be defined as `MOD = 998244353` before it is used in the summation.
- The function does not take into account the possibility of `l` and `r` being very large, which could lead to performance issues or even timeouts in practical scenarios.

Now, let's consider test cases to see if there are any examples where the program does not work as expected:

1. **Test Case**: 
   - Input: `l = 1`, `r = 10^18`, `k = 1`
   - Expected Output: Should compute the sum of numbers like `1, 2, 3, ..., 9` (i.e., `1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45`).
   - Actual Output: The program will attempt to iterate from `1` to `10^18`, which is not feasible.

2. **Test Case**:
   - Input: `l = 10`, `r = 50`, `k = 2`
   - Expected Output: The sum of numbers from `10` to `50` that contain at most `2` different digits.
   - Actual Output: The program will try to compute this by checking each number individually, which is inefficient and could lead to timeouts.

Given these points, it is clear that the program does not handle the constraints properly, especially with the upper limits of `l` and `r`. 

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to compute results within the constraints effectively and does not define `MOD`, leading to incorrect behavior for large input ranges.
