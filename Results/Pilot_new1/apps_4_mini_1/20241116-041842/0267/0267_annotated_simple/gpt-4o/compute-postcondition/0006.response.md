The value of `num` is equal to `l + 1`, and `total_sum` is initially 0. The code updates `total_sum` to be `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Since `total_sum` is 0, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`. The variable `num` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `(l + 1) % MOD`, and `num` is equal to `l + 1`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is `(l + 1) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1**
