The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters are defined as follows: `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function returns the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` for which another function `func_1(num, k)` returns true, calculated modulo `MOD`. If the input conditions are not met, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers within that range that satisfy a condition defined by another function, while handling cases where the input conditions are not satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l` and `r` defining a range, and an integer `k`, returning the sum of integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`, or 0 if input conditions are not met.**
