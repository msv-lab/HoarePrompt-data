The code updates `dp[n, k]` with a computed value based on `k`. Since `k` is 1, the loop does not execute, meaning that `dp[n, k]` remains unchanged. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9, and it is not modified by the code. Therefore, the output state indicates that `dp[n, k]` remains 9.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` remains 9**
