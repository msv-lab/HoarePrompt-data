The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` to its previous value. Given that `i` is 2, we can substitute `i` into the formula:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`, which is `10 ** (2 - 1) = 10 ** 1 = 10`.
2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`, which is `10 ** (k - 2)`.
3. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`, which is again `10`.
4. The expression `(10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` becomes `(10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.

Now, substituting these values into the original update formula:

- The updated value for `dp[n, k]` is `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `dp[n, k]` based on the calculations made. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 + 9 * (10^{(k - 1)} - 1) + 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`; `i` is 2; `k` is greater than 2**
