Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the tuple (n, k) exists in the collection dp, the function returns the value associated with (n, k) in dp. If (n, k) is not in dp, the function does not return any value, and the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.***
