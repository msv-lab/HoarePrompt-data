Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, `b - a` is checked for divisibility by `c` and if the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are satisfied, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if either condition fails, the output is 'NO'.***
