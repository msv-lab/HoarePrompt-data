Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not 0, the output is 'YES' if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
