The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the printed result while acknowledging the existing values of the variables.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, the value of `c` is not equal to 0, the value of `b` is not equal to `a`, and the difference `(b - a)` is either not divisible by `c` or is negative when divided by `c`; 'NO' is printed.**
