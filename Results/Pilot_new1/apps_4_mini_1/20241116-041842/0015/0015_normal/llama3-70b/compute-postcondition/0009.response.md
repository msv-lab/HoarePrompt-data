The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The output state reflects that 'YES' has been printed, but the values of the integers remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `c` is not equal to 0; the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; and 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `c` is not equal to 0; the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; and 'YES' has been printed.**
