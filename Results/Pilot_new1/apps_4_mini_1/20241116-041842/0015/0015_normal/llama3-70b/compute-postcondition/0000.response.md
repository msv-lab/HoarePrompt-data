The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be assigned new values based on the input provided through `input().split()`, which will be converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, so they will be replaced with the new integer values. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on input values**
