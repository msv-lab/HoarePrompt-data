The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. However, since these values are not passed as parameters to the function, it implies that the function may be using some form of global variables or internal state to obtain these values. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the current details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified. It operates on three integer values a, b, and c within the range -10^9 to 10^9.**
