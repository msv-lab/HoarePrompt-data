Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the function prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers all cases, including when `c` is 0, when `a` equals `b`, and when the divisibility and non-negativity conditions are met or not met.***
