The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is 0; `a` is not equal to `b`; printed output is 'NO'**
