The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided. Thus, we can express the output state in terms of the operations performed.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
