The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `c` will take on a new integer value based on user input. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
