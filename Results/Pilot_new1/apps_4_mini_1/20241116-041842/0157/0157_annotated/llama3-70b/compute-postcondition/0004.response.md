To calculate the output state, we first need to determine the value of `min_lemon`. Since `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, we will denote it as `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`.

The print statement calculates the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This can be simplified as follows:

- The expression can be factored: 
  \[
  \text{output} = min\_lemon \times (1 + 2 + 4) = min\_lemon \times 7
  \]

Thus, the final output will be `7 * min_lemon`.

The output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the computed `min_lemon` value, along with the result of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output is `7 * min_lemon`.**
