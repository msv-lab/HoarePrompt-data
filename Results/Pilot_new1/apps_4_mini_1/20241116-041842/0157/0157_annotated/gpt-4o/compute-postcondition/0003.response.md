The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers as per the initial state. Therefore, `max_lemons` will be the smallest value among these three calculated values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a positive integer input, `c` is an input integer, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
