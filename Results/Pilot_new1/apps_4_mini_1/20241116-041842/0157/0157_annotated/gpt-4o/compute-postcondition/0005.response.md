To determine the output state, we analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet:

1. The variables are initialized as follows:
   - `a` is a positive integer input.
   - `b` is a positive integer input.
   - `c` is an input integer.
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
   - `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

2. The code snippet `print(total_fruits)` outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since the function of the code is to print the value of `total_fruits`, the output state will include the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a positive integer input, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**
