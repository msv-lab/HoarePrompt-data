To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both carefully.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to make a compote, following the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. The fruits must be used in whole numbers, and if he cannot make any compote, the output should be 0.

**Program Code:**
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

**Output Hints:**
The output hints describe that the function calculates the minimum number of complete sets of items (lemons, apples, pears) that can be made based on the available quantities. It states that it prints the total number of items that can be made based on the minimum sets calculated.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the minimum of:
   - `a` (number of lemons)
   - `b // 2` (half the number of apples, since 2 apples are needed for each lemon)
   - `c // 4` (a quarter of the number of pears, since 4 pears are needed for each lemon)
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which corresponds to the total fruits used in the compote according to the ratios.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `a`, `b`, or `c` is less than the required amounts to make even one set (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears), the code should return 0. This is handled correctly by the calculation of `min_lemon`.
2. The case where `b` or `c` is not sufficient to form at least one complete set should yield 0, which is correctly handled.
3. The program works correctly for the provided examples:
   - For inputs `2, 5, 7`, it correctly identifies that 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears can be used, returning 7.
   - For inputs `4, 7, 13`, it correctly identifies that 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears can be used, returning 21.
   - For inputs `2, 3, 2`, it correctly identifies that no complete set can be made, returning 0.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, as the function indeed calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the provided quantities.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases as per the requirements. Therefore, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
