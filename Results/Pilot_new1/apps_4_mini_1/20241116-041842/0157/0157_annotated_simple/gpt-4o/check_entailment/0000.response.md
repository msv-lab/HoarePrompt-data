To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

The problem requires us to calculate the maximum number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to create a compote in the ratio of 1:2:4. This means for every lemon, we need exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())  # number of lemons
    b = int(input())  # number of apples
    c = int(input())  # number of pears
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)  # Calculate the maximum lemons we can use
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4  # Total fruits used
    print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three positive integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`: This line correctly computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears.
   - `b // 2` ensures that for each lemon, there are enough apples.
   - `c // 4` ensures that for each lemon, there are enough pears.
3. **Calculating Total Fruits**:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`: This line calculates the total number of fruits used based on the number of lemons.
4. **Output**: Finally, the total number of fruits is printed.

### Edge Cases:
Now let's consider potential edge cases that could break the logic:
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` are at their minimum values (1), we should check if the program handles those cases correctly.
- If `b` is less than 2 or `c` is less than 4, the program should return 0.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case 1**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     1
     1
     1
     ```
   - Expected Output: `0` (Not enough apples or pears)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Case 2**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     1
     2
     3
     ```
   - Expected Output: `7` (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Incorrect, should be 0 because we cannot use any fruits)

3. **Case 3**: 
   - Input: 
     ```
     2
     3
     2
     ```
   - Expected Output: `0` (Not enough pears)
   - Actual Output: `0` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program fails in the case where the number of apples is not sufficient to support any lemons (i.e., when `b < 2`), as it does not correctly return `0` when it should.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
