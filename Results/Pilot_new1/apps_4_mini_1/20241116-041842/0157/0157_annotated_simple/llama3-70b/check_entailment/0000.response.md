To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). The required ratio for making the compote is:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

We need to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used in the compote while adhering to this ratio. If it's not possible to make any compote, we should return 0.

### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The function reads three integers from input: `a` (lemons), `b` (apples), and `c` (pears).
2. It calculates `min_lemon`, which is the minimum of:
   - `a` (number of lemons available),
   - `b // 2` (maximum number of lemons that can be supported by the available apples),
   - `c // 4` (maximum number of lemons that can be supported by the available pears).
3. The total number of fruits used in the compote is calculated as:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7` (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears).

### Example Validations:
- **Example 1:**
  Input: 
  ```
  2
  5
  7
  ```
  - `min_lemon = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
  - Total = `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)

- **Example 2:**
  Input: 
  ```
  4
  7
  13
  ```
  - `min_lemon = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
  - Total = `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct)

- **Example 3:**
  Input: 
  ```
  2
  3
  2
  ```
  - `min_lemon = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
  - Total = `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
Now, let's check for edge cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values:**
   Input:
   ```
   1
   1
   1
   ```
   - `min_lemon = min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = min(1, 0, 0) = 0`
   - Total = `0` (Correct)

2. **Just Enough Fruits:**
   Input:
   ```
   1
   2
   4
   ```
   - `min_lemon = min(1, 2 // 2, 4 // 4) = min(1, 1, 1) = 1`
   - Total = `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)

3. **More Fruits Than Needed:**
   Input:
   ```
   10
   20
   40
   ```
   - `min_lemon = min(10, 20 // 2, 40 // 4) = min(10, 10, 10) = 10`
   - Total = `10 + 20 + 40 = 70` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote based on the provided ratios and constraints. I have tested various scenarios, including edge cases, and found that the program behaves as expected in all tested cases.

Correctness: **True**
