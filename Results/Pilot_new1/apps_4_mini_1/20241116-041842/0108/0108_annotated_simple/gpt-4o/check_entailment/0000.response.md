To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to transform a given string `s` such that it can contain the entire English alphabet `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` as a subsequence.
- We can replace any character with the next character in the alphabet, but cannot replace 'z'.
- If it's possible to achieve this, we should print the transformed string; if not, we should print `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    s = input()
    target = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    target_len = len(target)
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(s) and j < target_len:
        if s[i] == target[j]:
            j += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    if (j == target_len) :
        print(target)
    else :
        print(-1)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `s` is read from input.
   - `target` is set to the string `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.
   - `target_len` is the length of `target`, which is 26.
   - Two indices, `i` and `j`, are initialized to 0.

2. **While Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`.
   - If the character at `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, we increment `j`.
   - `i` is always incremented.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if `j` equals `target_len` (i.e., 26), it means all characters from 'a' to 'z' were found in order in `s`, and the program prints the `target`.
   - If not, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program checks for the presence of characters in order, but it does not account for the possibility of transforming characters to achieve the target. For example:
  - If `s` contains characters like `a`, `b`, `c`, but skips `d`, it wonâ€™t be able to form the subsequence `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` even if there are enough characters later in `s` to reach `z`.
- The program assumes that if it finds all characters in order, it can simply print `target`, which is incorrect because it does not ensure that all characters can be reached through allowed transformations.

### Counterexample:
- Consider the input `abcxyz`. 
- The program will find `a`, `b`, and `c` in order, but it will not find `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `o`, `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `y`, and `z` in order.
- Therefore, it should print `-1`, but it will incorrectly print `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem as it fails to account for the necessary transformations to achieve the complete subsequence of the alphabet.

Correctness: **False**
