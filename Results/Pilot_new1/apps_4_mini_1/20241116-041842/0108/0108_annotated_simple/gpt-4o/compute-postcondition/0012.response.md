To determine whether the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop statement: `while i < len(s) and j < target_len:`.

1. **Understanding the variables**:
   - `s` is a string with a length greater than 1.
   - `j` is either 0 or 1 and is less than `target_len`.
   - `i` has been increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

2. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` hold true.
   - Since `i` was increased by 1, we can conclude that `i` is now at least 1 (if it was initially 0) or greater than 1.
   - Given that the length of `s` is greater than 1, `len(s)` is at least 2.

3. **Evaluating the conditions**:
   - For `i` to allow the loop to execute again, we need `i` to be less than `len(s)`. Since `i` has increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)`. This means that the previous value of `i` must have been less than `len(s) - 1`.
   - For `j`, since it is either 0 or 1 and less than `target_len`, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `target_len` for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjustments needed**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we must ensure that `i` is less than `len(s)` after the increment. Thus, if `i` was `len(s) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust it to be less than `len(s) - 1`. 
   - Since `j` is either 0 or 1 and less than `target_len`, we need to ensure that `j` remains less than `target_len`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- We need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(s)`, which means `i` should be less than `len(s) - 1`.
- We will keep `j` as is since it is already less than `target_len`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 and less than `target_len`, and `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`**.
