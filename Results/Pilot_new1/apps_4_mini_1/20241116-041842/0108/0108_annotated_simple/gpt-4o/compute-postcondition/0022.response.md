Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If `s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then `j` is 26 and the function prints `target`. If `s` is shorter than 26 characters, does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, or is empty, then `j` will be less than 26, `i` will be the length of `s`, and the function prints -1.***
