According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `alphabet`. The variable `char` will take on each letter from 'a' to 'z' in each iteration. The current state of `s` is not relevant to the execution of the loop itself, as the loop does not depend on `s`. 

For the loop to execute, the variable `char` needs to be initialized to the first character in `alphabet`, which is 'a'. Since `res` is an empty string, it does not affect the loop execution either. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the only relevant states are the initialization of `char` and the presence of `alphabet`. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is 'a', `res` is an empty string**
