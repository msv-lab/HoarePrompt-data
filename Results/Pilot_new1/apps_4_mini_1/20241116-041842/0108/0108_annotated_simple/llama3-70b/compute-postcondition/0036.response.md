According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in `alphabet`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `alphabet` after the last character processed in the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, and `s` has had its first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII. If `char` was found in `s`, `res` has been updated accordingly. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to reflect that `char` is now the next character in `alphabet`. The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `alphabet` to process.

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `char` is the next character in `alphabet` after the last processed character. Additionally, we need to ensure that `s` still contains `char` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`if char is in s then res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus the number of occurrences of `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet, s` contains `char`**
