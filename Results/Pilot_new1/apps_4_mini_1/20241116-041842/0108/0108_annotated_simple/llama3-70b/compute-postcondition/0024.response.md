Output State: **`if char is in s, then res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII for each iteration, and `char` will eventually reach the next character in `alphabet`. If `char` is not in `s` at the start, the loop does not execute and `res` remains unchanged. If `char` reaches a character not in `alphabet`, the loop will also stop executing.**
