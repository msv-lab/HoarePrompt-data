The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'a', and the value of `char` is also 'a'. Therefore, `res` becomes 'a' + 'a', which results in 'aa'. The other variables `s`, `alphabet`, and `char` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char` is 'a', `res` is 'aa'**
