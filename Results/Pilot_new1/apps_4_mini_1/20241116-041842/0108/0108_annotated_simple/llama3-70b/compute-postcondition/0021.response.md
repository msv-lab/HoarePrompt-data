The value of `res` is incremented by `char`. Since `char` is the next character in `alphabet` and `res` was previously increased by `char`, we can say that `res` now contains its previous value plus the value of `char`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, `s` still contains the next character, and `res` is increased by `char`.

Output State: **`alphabet` has at least one more character, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, `s` still contains the next character, and `res` is increased by `char`.**
