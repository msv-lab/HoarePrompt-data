Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of each character from `s` repeated based on its occurrences, with each occurrence replaced in `s` by the next character in ASCII order. The length of `res` is less than 26. If `s` contains no characters from `alphabet`, `res` is an empty string and `s` remains unchanged. If `s` contains characters beyond 'z', those characters are not processed, and `res` remains unchanged. The loop executes for each character in `alphabet`, and if `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, resulting in `res` being an empty string and `s` remaining unchanged.***
