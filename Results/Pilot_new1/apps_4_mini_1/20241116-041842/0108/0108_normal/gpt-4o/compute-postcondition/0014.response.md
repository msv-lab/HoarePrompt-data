Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, and `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. This ensures that `j` can only increase if the specific condition is met, maintaining its value within the bounds of 0 to 26.***
