The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `s`, `j`, and `i` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the values of `s`, `j`, and `i`.

Output State: **`s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order; `j` is less than 26; `i` is the length of `s`, which can be any non-negative integer (including 0 if `s` is empty or contains no letters), and the output is -1.**
