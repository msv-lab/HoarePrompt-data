The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It counts occurrences of each letter from 'a' to 'z' in the order they appear in `s`, and replaces each occurrence with the next letter in the alphabet. If the count of unique characters collected in `res` is exactly 26, it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` remains empty, and the function prints -1. Characters outside the range of 'a' to 'z' in `s` are unaffected by the processing.
