Postcondition: ***`res` contains occurrences of characters from 'a' to 'z' that were found in the original string `s`, but not all characters from 'a' to 'z' are present, meaning `res` has fewer than 26 characters. `s` remains unchanged and may contain characters outside of 'a' to 'z' that are unaffected by the loop.***
