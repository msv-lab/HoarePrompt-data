Postcondition: ***`res` contains occurrences of each character from 'a' to 'z' in the order they were found in the original string `s`. If `res` has a length of exactly 26, the function prints `res`. If `res` has fewer than 26 characters, indicating that not all characters from 'a' to 'z' were present in `s`, the function prints -1. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` remains an empty string, and the function prints -1. Characters in `s` that are outside the range of 'a' to 'z' are unaffected by the loop.***
