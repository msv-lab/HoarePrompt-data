The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the Unicode table. Since `s` currently contains 'a', and assuming `char` is also 'a', it will be replaced by 'b'. The other variable `res` is updated by adding `char`, but the specific value of `char` is not provided. 

Therefore, the output state is that `s` is modified to contain 'b', and `res` has been updated with the value of `char`. 

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is updated by adding `char`**
