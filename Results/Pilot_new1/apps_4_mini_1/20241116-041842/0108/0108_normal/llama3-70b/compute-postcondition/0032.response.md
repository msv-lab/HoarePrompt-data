The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to `res`. Since `res` already contains all occurrences of `char` plus one additional occurrence, after this operation, `res` will contain one more occurrence of `char`, making it two additional occurrences in total. The state of `s` is not affected by this operation, as it only modifies `res`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all occurrences of `char` plus two additional occurrences of `char`, and `s` is modified to include one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet.

Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of `char` plus two additional occurrences of `char`, `s` is modified to include one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet**
