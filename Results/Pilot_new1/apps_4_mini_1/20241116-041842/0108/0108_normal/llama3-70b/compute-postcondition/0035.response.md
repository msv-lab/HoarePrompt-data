Output State: **`if char is in s then res` contains all occurrences of `char` followed by the number of times `char` was found in `s`, `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `s` is modified to have one occurrence of `char` replaced with its next character in the alphabet. If `char` is not in `s`, the loop doesn't execute and `res` remains unchanged, while `s` stays the same.**
