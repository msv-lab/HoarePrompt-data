According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet`. If `alphabet` contains at least one character, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is 'c', and we don't have information about the content of `alphabet`, but we know that it must have had at least one character for the loop to execute previously. 

To execute one more time, `alphabet` must still contain characters and `char` must be updated to the next character in `alphabet`. Since we only know that `char` was 'c', we can assume that `alphabet` is a sequence of characters that includes 'c' and possibly more characters following it. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we need to set `char` to the next character after 'c' in `alphabet`.

State: **`alphabet` contains characters after 'c', char is the next character in `alphabet` after 'c'**
