Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where it is possible to replace characters in the input string to achieve the target subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". 

For example, consider the input string `aaabbbcccddd`. In this case, the program will check for the subsequence but will not account for the ability to replace characters. The string can be transformed to contain "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" by replacing 'a' with 'a', 'b' with 'c', 'c' with 'd', etc., but the program will incorrectly return `-1` because it does not consider the character replacement allowed by the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
