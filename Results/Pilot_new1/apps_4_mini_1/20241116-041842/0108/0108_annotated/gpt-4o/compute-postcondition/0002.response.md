The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, which calculates the length of the string `target`. Since `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', its length is 26. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26**
