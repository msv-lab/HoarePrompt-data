The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1. The other variables `s` and `target` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `target` is unchanged**
