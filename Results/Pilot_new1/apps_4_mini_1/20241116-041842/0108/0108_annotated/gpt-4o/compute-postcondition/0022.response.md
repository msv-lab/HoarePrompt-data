Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length greater than or equal to 0. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, the function prints `target`. If `j` is less than `target_len` (including the case where `j` is 0), the function prints -1. In the case where `s` is empty, `i` is 0 and `j` is also 0, leading to the output of -1.***
