The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by appending occurrences of each letter from 'a' to 'z' found in `s`, replacing each occurrence in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. If `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res`. If not, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result based on the conditions.
