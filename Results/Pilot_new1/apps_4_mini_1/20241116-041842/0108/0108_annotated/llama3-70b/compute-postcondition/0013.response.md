Output State: **`if s contains at least one 'a', then res will contain all occurrences of 'a' in s followed by all occurrences of 'b' in s and so on, until 'z' or until no more characters can be replaced. At the end of the loop, 's' will consist of characters that are not in the alphabet or will be empty if all were replaced, 'res' will contain a string of characters from 'a' to the last character found in s, and 'char' will be 'z' if 'z' was the last character processed. If s does not contain 'a' initially, the loop will not execute and 'res' will remain empty, while 's' will remain unchanged.**
