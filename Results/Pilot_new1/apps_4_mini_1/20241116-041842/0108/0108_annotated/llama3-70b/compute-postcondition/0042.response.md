Postcondition: ***If `s` contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z', then `res` will contain all occurrences of characters from 'a' to 'z' and will have a length of 26, resulting in the function printing `res`. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', then `s` remains unchanged (containing only non-alphabetic characters or being empty), `res` remains empty, and the function prints -1.***
