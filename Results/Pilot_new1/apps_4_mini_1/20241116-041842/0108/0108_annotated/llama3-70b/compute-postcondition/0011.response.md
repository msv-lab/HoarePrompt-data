The variable `s` is modified to contain 'b', and the character `char` is 'b'. The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table, which is 'c'. Therefore, `s` changes from 'b' to 'c'. The variables `alphabet` and `res` are not affected by this operation. 

The output state is: `s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
