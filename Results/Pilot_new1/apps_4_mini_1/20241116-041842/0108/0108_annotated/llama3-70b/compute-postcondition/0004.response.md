The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. Since `char` is the first character in `alphabet`, which is 'a', `res` will now contain the string 'a'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'**
