The variable `res` is updated by appending the current value of `char` to it. The previous values of `s` and `char` are not altered by this operation, but `res` will now include the value of `char`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `s` and `char`, along with the updated value of `res` which now includes `char`.

Output State: **`s` has had its first occurrence of 'z' replaced with '{'; `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z' plus `char`; `s` has had the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the character following it in ASCII and `char` is still in `s`; `res` is updated to include `char`.**
