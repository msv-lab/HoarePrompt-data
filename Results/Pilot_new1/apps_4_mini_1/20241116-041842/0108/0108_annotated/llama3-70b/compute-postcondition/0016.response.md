The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` (which is 'z') in the string `s` with the character that comes after 'z' in the ASCII table. The ASCII value of 'z' is 122, and adding 1 to it gives us 123, which corresponds to the character '{'. 

Since `s` contains at least one 'a', this operation will change the first occurrence of 'z' in `s` to '{'. The variable `res` remains unchanged as it contains occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z'. 

Therefore, the output state is that `s` has had its first occurrence of 'z' replaced with '{', and `res` still contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z'.

Output State: **`s` has had its first occurrence of 'z' replaced with '{'; `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' to 'z' found in `s` plus 'z'**
