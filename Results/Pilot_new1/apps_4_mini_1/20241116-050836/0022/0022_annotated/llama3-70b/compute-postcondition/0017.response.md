Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, then `is_spalindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome; if any characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that an empty string or a single character is inherently a palindrome.**
