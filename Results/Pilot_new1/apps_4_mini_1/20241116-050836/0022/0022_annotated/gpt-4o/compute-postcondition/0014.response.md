The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. If the length of `s` is at least 2, the function checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and the end. If any characters are not equal during this comparison, the function returns `False`. If all characters are equal, the function completes without returning `False`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. If the length of `s` is less than 2, the function does not perform any comparisons and returns `True`, indicating that the string is trivially a palindrome.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome or trivially a palindrome (if its length is less than 2); otherwise, it returns `False` if `s` is not a palindrome.**
