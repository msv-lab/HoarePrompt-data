According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4, which means `n // 2` is at least 2. Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Additionally, since the loop condition is based on `i` being less than `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `n // 2` is at least 3, which implies that `n` must be at least 6.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is at least 6, `i` is 3**
