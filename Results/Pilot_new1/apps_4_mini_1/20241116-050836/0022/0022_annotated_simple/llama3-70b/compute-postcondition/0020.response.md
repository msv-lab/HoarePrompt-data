Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input and checks if it is a palindrome. It compares characters symmetrically from both ends of the string. If the characters do not match, it determines that the string is not a palindrome. It prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not return any value. Edge cases include handling strings of length 1, which are always palindromes, and strings with non-alphabetic characters, which are not validated in this implementation. **
