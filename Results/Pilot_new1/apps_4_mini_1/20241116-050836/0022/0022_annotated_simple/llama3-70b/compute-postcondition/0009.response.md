The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, changing its previous value from `True` to `False`. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, and `i` is 1**
