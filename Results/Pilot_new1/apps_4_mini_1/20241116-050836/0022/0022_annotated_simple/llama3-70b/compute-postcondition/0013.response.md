The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `is_spalindrome` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_spalindrome` is False**
