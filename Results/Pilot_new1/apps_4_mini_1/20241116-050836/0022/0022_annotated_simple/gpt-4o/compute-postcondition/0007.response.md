Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000. If the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False, indicating that the string is not symmetric at those indices. If the characters are equal, the function does not return anything, and further checks may be required for symmetry in subsequent iterations.***
