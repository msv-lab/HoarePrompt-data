Output State: **If `n` is even, the loop will execute `n // 2` times, comparing characters from the start and end of the string `s`. If any characters do not match, the function returns False, indicating `s` is not a palindrome. If all characters match, the loop completes without returning, suggesting `s` may be a palindrome. If `n` is odd, the loop will execute `n // 2` times, and the same logic applies. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return anything, implying `s` is a palindrome by default. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and the function does not handle this case, which may lead to unexpected behavior.**
