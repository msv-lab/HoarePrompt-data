The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The initial state of the other variables, `s` and `n`, remains unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True.

Output State: **`s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True**
