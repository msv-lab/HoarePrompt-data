Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1 < n // 2`. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop is exited. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and further checks may continue.***
