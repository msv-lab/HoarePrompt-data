Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} `k_{i}` ≤ `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int) initialized to return 0 for any missing key, and `left` is 0.**
