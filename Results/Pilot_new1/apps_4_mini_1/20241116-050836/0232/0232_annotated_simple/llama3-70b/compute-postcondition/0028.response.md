Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer, `counts` is a list of integers, `found` is False, `window_counts` has `color` as a key with a value of 1 (or it remains unchanged if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`), and the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts` exactly.***
