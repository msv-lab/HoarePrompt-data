The values of `n` and `m` are assigned based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not specified, but they will be updated to the values provided in the input. Other variables such as `colors` and `counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `m` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input, `m` is an integer based on input, `colors` is a list of n integers, `counts` is a list of m integers**
