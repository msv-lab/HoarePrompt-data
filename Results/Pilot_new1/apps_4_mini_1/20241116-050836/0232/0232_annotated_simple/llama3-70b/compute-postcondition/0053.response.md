According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, since `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, which means `i` must be adjusted to ensure that it is less than `n` for the loop to run one more time. 

To allow the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be set to `n - 1` (the last valid index for the loop to run). The other states such as `window_counts` and `found` do not need to be modified for the loop to execute again, as they are dependent on the loop's execution.

State: **`window_counts` is empty, `found` is False, `i` is `n - 1`**
