The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary. The states of the other variables, `found` and `i`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `i` is less than n, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is less than n, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
