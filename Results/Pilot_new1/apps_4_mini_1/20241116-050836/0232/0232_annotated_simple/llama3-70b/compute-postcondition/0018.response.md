Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list, and the value is the count of occurrences of that color. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. `n` is the length of `colors`, `m` is an integer, and `counts` is a list of integers.**
