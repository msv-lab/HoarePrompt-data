Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining as an empty dictionary and `found` as False.***
