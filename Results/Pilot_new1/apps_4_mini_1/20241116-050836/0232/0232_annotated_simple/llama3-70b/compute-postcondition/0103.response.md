The value of `found` is assigned `True`, changing its state from `False` to `True`. The other variables `i`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
