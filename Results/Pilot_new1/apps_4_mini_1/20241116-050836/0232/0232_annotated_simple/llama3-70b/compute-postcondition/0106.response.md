According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `found` is False, `i` is still less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the value of `j`. Since `j` is currently `i + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`, and `n` must remain greater than `i + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `found` remains False and does not affect the loop execution in this context.

State: **`found` is False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
