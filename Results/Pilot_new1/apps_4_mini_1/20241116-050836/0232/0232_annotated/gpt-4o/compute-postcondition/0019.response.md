The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `right` has a value of `n + 1`, which means we are accessing `colors[n + 1]`. The previous state of `current_counts` is updated for the specific color at index `right`. The other variables `left` and `current_counts` remain unchanged except for the increment at the specified index. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` is updated for `colors[n + 1]`, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated for `colors[n + 1]`, `left` is `left + 1`, `right` is `n + 1**
