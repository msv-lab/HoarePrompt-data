Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, and `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is at most `n` and each element is at least 1. If the counts of each color in `current_counts` match the corresponding desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If they do not match, the function does not return any value.***
