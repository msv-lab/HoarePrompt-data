Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, indicating that the current window satisfies the required conditions. Otherwise, `found` remains False, `window_counts` continues to include the key `color` with a value of either 1 or the previous value plus 1, and the variables `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.***
