Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If `found` is False, the loop continues without any changes to `window_counts`, which may include the key `color` with its incremented value if the loop had executed, or remain unchanged if `i` is less than `n` or if `i` is greater than or equal to `n` and the loop did not start, leaving `window_counts` as an empty dictionary.***
