The code initializes an empty dictionary `color_counts`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new state of `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of n integers from input, `counts` is a new list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary {}**
