The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary, which means it is now initialized as `{}`. The previous values of `found`, `window_counts`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `window_counts` while the other variables retain their prior values.

Output State: **`found` is False, `window_counts` is {}, `i` is less than n, `n` remains unchanged**
