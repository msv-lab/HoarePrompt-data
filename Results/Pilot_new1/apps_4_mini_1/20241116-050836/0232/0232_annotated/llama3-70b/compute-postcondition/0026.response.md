Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is updated such that if `color` (which is `colors[j]`) was not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; if `color` was already present, there is no change to `window_counts`. `j` remains 0 and `color` is still `colors[j]`.***
