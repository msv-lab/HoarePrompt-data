Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, and `window_counts` is updated to include `color`. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is now set to 0. The variable `found` remains False, and `j` is equal to n.***
