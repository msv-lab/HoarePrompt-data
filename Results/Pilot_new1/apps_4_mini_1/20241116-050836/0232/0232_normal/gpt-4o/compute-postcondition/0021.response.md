Output State: **`current_counts` contains the counts of colors processed so far, `left` is the index of the leftmost color that is being considered for removal, `right` is the index of the current color being added, and if the loop executes but does not return 'YES', it indicates that the desired counts have not been met. If the loop does not start, it means at least one color in `current_counts` is below its desired count, leaving `left` at 0 and `current_counts` unchanged. If the loop executes and does not return 'YES', `current_counts` will be updated according to the colors processed during the loop execution. The loop will not execute if `n` is 0 or if `colors` is empty, in which case `current_counts` remains empty and `left` is 0.**
