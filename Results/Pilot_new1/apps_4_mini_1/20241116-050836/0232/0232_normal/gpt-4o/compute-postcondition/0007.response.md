Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_i ≤ n, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`. If the counts of each color in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If they do not match, the function does not return anything, indicating that the desired counts have not been met.***
