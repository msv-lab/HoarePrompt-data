The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `j` is one greater than its previous value, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
