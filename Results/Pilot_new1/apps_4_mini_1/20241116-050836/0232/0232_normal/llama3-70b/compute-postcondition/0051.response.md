The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 0 and less than `n`, and `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1 for each unique color encountered, and we break out of the most internal loop.
