The code initializes an empty dictionary `color_counts`. The values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `color_counts` is now an empty dictionary while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
