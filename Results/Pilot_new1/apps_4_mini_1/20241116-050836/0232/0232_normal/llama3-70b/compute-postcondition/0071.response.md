The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
