The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The values of the other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
