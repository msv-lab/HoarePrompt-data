Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited immediately, indicating that a match was found. If `found` is False, then `j` is set to `n`, `i` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` contains the counts of colors encountered in the range from `i` to `n - 1`, while `found` remains False. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `n` is not greater than `i + 1`), `found` remains False, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.***
