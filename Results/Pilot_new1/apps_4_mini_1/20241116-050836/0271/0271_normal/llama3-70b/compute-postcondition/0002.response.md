The code prints the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer and is divisible by 10. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is divisible by 10, and the value of `n` is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is divisible by 10, and the value of `n` is printed**
