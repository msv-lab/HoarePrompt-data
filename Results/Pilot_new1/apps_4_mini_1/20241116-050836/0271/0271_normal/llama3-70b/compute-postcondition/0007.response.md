To determine the output state after executing the given code, we note the following:

1. The initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer, not divisible by 10, and `n % 10` is greater than 5. This means `n` can take values like 6, 7, 8, or 9, or any larger integer that ends with these digits (e.g., 16, 17, 18, 19, etc.).

2. The code snippet `print(n + (10 - n % 10))` calculates the value to be printed:
   - `n % 10` gives the remainder of `n` when divided by 10, which is guaranteed to be greater than 5.
   - Thus, `10 - n % 10` will yield a value that is less than 5 (because `n % 10` is greater than 5).
   - Therefore, `n + (10 - n % 10)` effectively rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10.

3. The print statement outputs this calculated value.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer satisfying the conditions, the output state will reflect that `n` is a non-negative integer, and it will also indicate the result of the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is not divisible by 10, `n % 10` is greater than 5; the printed value is `n + (10 - n % 10)` which rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10.**
