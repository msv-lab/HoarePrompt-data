To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(result)
```

However, the calculation for `result` based on the value of `n` is not included in the code snippet. The logic described states that:

- If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n` minus the remainder.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder.

Since the code does not actually compute `result`, we cannot determine its value directly from the provided information. Therefore, we will assume that the necessary calculations for `result` have been made prior to the print statement.

Given that `result` is meant to be the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`, we can express the output state as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `result` is the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`.**
