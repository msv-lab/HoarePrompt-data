Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is divisible by 10, the output is `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, the output is the next multiple of 10 after `n`.***
