The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output of this expression will always be `n` minus the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. 

This means that if `n` is, for example, 23, the calculation would be `23 - 3 = 20`. If `n` were 57, it would be `57 - 7 = 50`. The overall effect is that `n` is reduced to the nearest lower multiple of 10.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the original value of `n` and the calculated value of `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the output is `n - n % 10`, which is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.**
