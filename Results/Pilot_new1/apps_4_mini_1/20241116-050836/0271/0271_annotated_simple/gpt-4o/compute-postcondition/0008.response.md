The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates based on a non-negative integer `n`, which is constrained such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The output of the function has not been specified, so we cannot determine the return value or functionality based on the provided information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a non-negative integer n constrained between 0 and 10^9, but the specific return value is not defined.**
