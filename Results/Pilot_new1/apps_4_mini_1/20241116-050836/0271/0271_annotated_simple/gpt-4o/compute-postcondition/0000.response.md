The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). Since the new value of `n` will depend on the input, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer, but its specific value is not known.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
