The expression `n - n % 10` calculates the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer that is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the value of `n - n % 10` will be `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10. 

The output state remains unchanged for `n`, but we can represent the result of the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the result of the operation `n - n % 10` is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the result of the operation is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.**
