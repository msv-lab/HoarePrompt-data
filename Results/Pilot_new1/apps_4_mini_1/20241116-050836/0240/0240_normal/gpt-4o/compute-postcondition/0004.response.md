Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, there is no action taken.***
