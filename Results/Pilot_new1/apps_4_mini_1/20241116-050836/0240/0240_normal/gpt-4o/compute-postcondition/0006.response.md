The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it takes the characters from the permutation `perm` and joins them into a single string. Since `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold that same second permutation as a string. The initial state remains unchanged for `chars` and `perm`. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the second permutation of `chars`**
