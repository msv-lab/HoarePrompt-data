The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, but it will raise a `NameError` due to the undefined variable `n_len`. If `n_len` were defined, it would return `True` if `sub` is found in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` equals `n_len`; otherwise, it would return `False`.
