The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`. It generates all permutations of `chars` and yields each permutation that is considered a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only one digit, it yields that digit if it is valid. There is no functionality in the code for inserting `sub` into `chars`, despite the annotations suggesting that. Therefore, the function does not return any collection of possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars`, but rather yields valid permutations of `chars` alone.
