The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It checks if `sub` is present in `num_str` and if `num_str` has a specific length defined by `n_len`. However, the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function, which will lead to a NameError if the function is called. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement its intended functionality of checking both the substring presence and the length condition.
