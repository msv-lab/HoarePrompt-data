To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Vasya has a very large integer `n` which he wrote as a string.
2. He appended to it the integer `k`, which is the number of digits in `n`.
3. The string received by Kate has all the digits of `n` and `k` shuffled.
4. We need to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` given a non-empty substring of `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The provided program takes two inputs:
- `s`: the shuffled string of digits.
- `t`: the substring of `n`.

The function `func_1(s, t)` works as follows:
1. It creates a set `t_set` from the substring `t`.
2. It initializes an empty string `n` to build the potential number.
3. It iterates through each character `c` in `s` and checks if it exists in `t_set`.
4. If it does, it appends `c` to `n`.
5. Finally, it appends the substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program does not handle leading zeros correctly. If `s` contains leading zeros and `t` is appended directly, it may lead to a larger number than necessary. For example, if `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", the digits selected could be "300" leading to "30021", which is correct. However, if the implementation does not consider the order and the smallest possible arrangement, it may yield incorrect results.
2. **Smallest Integer Construction**: The program constructs `n` by simply concatenating the digits found in `s` that are also in `t`. This does not guarantee the smallest possible integer `n` unless the digits are sorted correctly. The digits should be arranged in ascending order before appending `t` to ensure the smallest possible number.

### Counterexample:
Let's consider the input:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```
The expected output is `30021`. However, if the digits are not processed correctly (for example, if the program simply concatenated found digits without ensuring the smallest arrangement), it could lead to an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, particularly with the potential for leading zeros and the construction of the smallest integer, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every case.

Correctness: **False**.
