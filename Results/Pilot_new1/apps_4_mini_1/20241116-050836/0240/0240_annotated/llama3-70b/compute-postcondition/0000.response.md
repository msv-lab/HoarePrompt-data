The variable `t_set` is assigned the value of `set(t)`, which creates a set containing the unique characters from the string `t`. The initial state of the variables is not altered, but the value of `t_set` is determined by the unique characters in `t`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a non-empty string representing a substring of `s`, and `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a non-empty string representing a substring of `s`, and `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`**
