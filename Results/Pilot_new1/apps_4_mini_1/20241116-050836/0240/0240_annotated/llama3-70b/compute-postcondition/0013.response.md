Output State: **`n` is a string containing the concatenation of characters from `s` that are present in `t_set`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains an empty string. If `s` contains no characters that are in `t_set`, then `n` remains an empty string. If `s` contains characters that are in `t_set`, `n` will contain those characters in the order they appear in `s`.**
