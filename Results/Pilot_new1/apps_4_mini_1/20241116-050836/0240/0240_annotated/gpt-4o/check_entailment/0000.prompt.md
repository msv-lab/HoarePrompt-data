You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s_counter` reflects the counts of characters in `s` after decreasing by the counts of characters in `sub`, `sub_counter` remains unchanged, and `n_len` is still len(s) - len(sub). If `sub_counter` is empty, the loop does not execute and `s_counter` remains unchanged. If `s_counter` has characters that are less than those in `sub_counter`, it may result in negative counts in `s_counter` after the loop executes.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list possible_numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string of digits `s` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`. It computes the character counts of both strings, subtracting the counts of characters in `sub` from those in `s`. It then generates possible numbers using the remaining characters in `s` after the subtraction. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the list of possible numbers derived from these inputs. If the subtraction results in negative counts for any character, this could lead to incorrect results in generating possible numbers. Additionally, if `s` does not contain enough characters to form `sub`, the behavior of `generate_possible_numbers` is not defined in the provided code, which could also lead to errors.

#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' is found within 'input_str' and the length of 'input_str' equals the length of 'sub', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty string `sub`. It returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str` and both strings have the same length. Otherwise, it returns False. However, the code does not account for cases where `num_str` may be empty or if `sub` is longer than `num_str`, which would always result in a False return in those scenarios.

#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will execute for all permutations of `chars`, yielding valid candidates based on the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and there are no yielded candidates. If `chars` contains only unique digits, all permutations will be processed; if `chars` contains duplicate digits, some permutations may yield the same candidate. The variable `perm` will represent each permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` will be the string formed from `perm`. If no valid candidates are found, nothing is yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`, and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that pass the `is_valid_number` check when evaluated against `sub`. It does not return a list but rather a generator that produces valid candidates one at a time. If `chars` is empty, no candidates will be yielded. Additionally, if `chars` contains duplicate digits, some permutations may yield the same candidate. The function does not handle the insertion of `sub` into `chars`; it only checks permutations of `chars` against the validity condition.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
