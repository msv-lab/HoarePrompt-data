The code snippet prints the string '0'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100], the value of `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `z` is equal to 0.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100], the value of `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `z` is equal to 0**
