Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the output is '?', while ensuring that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x â‰¤ y + z`). All cases maintain the initial conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.***
