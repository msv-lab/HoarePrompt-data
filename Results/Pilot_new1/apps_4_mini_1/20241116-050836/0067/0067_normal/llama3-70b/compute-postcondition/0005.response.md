The code executes a print statement that outputs a hyphen ('-'). The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged and are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., x â‰¤ y + z), and the output is '-'**
