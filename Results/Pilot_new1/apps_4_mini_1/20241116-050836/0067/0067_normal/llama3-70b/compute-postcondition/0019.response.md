Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input and evaluates their relationships. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. It prints '-' if `x` is less than `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, it prints '0' if `z` is 0, and '?' if `z` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '?'. The function does not handle cases where input values are outside the specified range [0, 100] and does not return any values; it only prints results.**
