Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` is 0, otherwise it is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y` and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '?'.***
