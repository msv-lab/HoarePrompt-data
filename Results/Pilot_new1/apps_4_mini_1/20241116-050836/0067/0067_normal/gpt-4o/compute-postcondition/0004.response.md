The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y` (an integer based on input) and `z` (also an integer based on input). Therefore, after execution, `max_downvotes` will hold the sum of `y` and `z`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on the input, `y` is an integer based on the input, `z` is an integer based on the input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
