Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (`y`), a hyphen is printed. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (`x`), a plus sign is printed. Otherwise, a question mark is printed. This ensures that all possible relationships between upvotes and downvotes are considered, including edge cases where the maximum upvotes and downvotes are equal to their respective minimums.***
