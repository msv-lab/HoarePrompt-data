Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, which represent minimum upvotes, minimum downvotes, and a range of possible additional votes, respectively. It calculates the maximum upvotes as `x + z` and maximum downvotes as `y + z`. The function then checks the relationships between these values and prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. This indicates the possible relationships between upvotes and downvotes based on the given input. **
