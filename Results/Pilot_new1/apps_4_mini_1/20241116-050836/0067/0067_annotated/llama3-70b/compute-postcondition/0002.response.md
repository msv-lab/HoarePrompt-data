The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the character '+'. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not changed by this operation, and their relationship remains the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, as well as the fact that the character '+' has been printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`; '+' has been printed.**
