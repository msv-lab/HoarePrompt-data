Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen '-' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is positive, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y`, '?' is also printed, while ensuring that `x` remains less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` throughout all cases.***
