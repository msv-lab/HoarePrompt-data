The code prints the string '0', which does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. The initial conditions regarding `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the value of `x` is equal to `y`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; and `z` is equal to 0. Additionally, the output of the print statement is '0'.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the value of `x` is equal to `y`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; `z` is equal to 0; and the output is '0'**
