To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations carefully.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The outputs can be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal.
   - "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes due to the unknown votes.

### Code Analysis:
The code logic is structured as follows:
- If `x > y + z`, it prints "+".
- If `x < y`, it prints "-".
- If `x == y`:
  - If `z == 0`, it prints "0".
  - If `z > 0`, it prints "?".
- If `x > y`, it prints "?".

### Annotations Summary:
The annotations explain the state of the program after each decision point, confirming that:
- If `x > y + z`, then "+" is printed.
- If `x < y`, then "-" is printed.
- If `x == y` and `z == 0`, "0" is printed; if `z > 0`, "?" is printed.
- If `x > y`, it prints "?".

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case 1**: `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - According to the problem description, this should output "?" because the unknown vote could either be an upvote or a downvote.
   - The code correctly outputs "?".
   
2. **Case 2**: `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
   - This should output "-" because there are more downvotes than upvotes.
   - The code correctly outputs "-".

3. **Case 3**: `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - This should output "+" because even if the unknown votes are downvotes, upvotes are still greater.
   - The code correctly outputs "+".

4. **Case 4**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - This should output "0" because upvotes equal downvotes.
   - The code correctly outputs "0".

5. **Case 5**: `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`
   - This should output "?" because the unknown vote can lead to either a tie or one more upvote than downvote.
   - The code outputs "?" correctly.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code against the problem description and the provided examples, the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the requirements. The annotations support the correctness of the logic implemented.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly implements the required logic for all cases presented in the problem description.
