Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (`y`), the output is '-'. If `max_downvotes` (`y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (`x`), the output is '+'. Otherwise, the output is '?'. This ensures that the relationships between the upvotes and downvotes are maintained, covering all possible cases based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.***
