`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are new input integers, but we do not know their specific values. The previous value of `min_upvotes` is `x`, and it remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignments and the relationship between the variables.

Output State: **`x` is a new input integer, `y` is a new input integer, `z` is a new input integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`**
