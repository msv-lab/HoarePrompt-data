Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. The value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. Additionally, `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, meaning `y + z` is less than `x`.***
