The function reads three integers from input, representing upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and an additional variable (`z`). It calculates the maximum possible upvotes as `x + z` and the maximum possible downvotes as `y + z`. The function then evaluates the relationships between these calculated values and returns three possible outputs: '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is satisfied. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; instead, it prints the result directly.
