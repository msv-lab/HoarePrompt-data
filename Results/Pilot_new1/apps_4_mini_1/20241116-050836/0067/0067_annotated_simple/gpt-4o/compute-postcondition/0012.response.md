Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100. If `max_downvotes` (which is not explicitly defined but can be inferred as a value less than `min_upvotes`) is less than `min_upvotes` (where `min_upvotes` is not defined but can be assumed to be greater than or equal to `y`), the program prints '+'. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, the program prints '?'. The value of `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z` and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, ensuring that the relationship between these variables is maintained throughout the execution.***
