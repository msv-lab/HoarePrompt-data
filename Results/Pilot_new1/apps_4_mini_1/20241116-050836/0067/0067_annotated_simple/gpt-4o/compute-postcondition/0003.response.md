The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`**
