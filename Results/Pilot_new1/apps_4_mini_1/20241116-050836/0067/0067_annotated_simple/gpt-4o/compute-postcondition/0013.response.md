Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100. If `max_upvotes` (which is equal to `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is equal to `y`), a hyphen '-' is printed. If `max_downvotes` (which is equal to `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is equal to `x`), a plus sign '+' is printed. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, a question mark '?' is printed. This ensures that the relationships between `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` are maintained throughout the execution.***
