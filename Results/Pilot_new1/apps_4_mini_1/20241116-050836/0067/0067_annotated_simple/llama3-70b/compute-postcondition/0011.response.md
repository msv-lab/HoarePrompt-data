The code executes a print statement which outputs a string `?`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is greater than 0; printed output is '?'**
