Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the output is '?'.***
