The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged as the print statement does not alter any variable states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now {remainder}, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is `n % 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now {remainder}, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is `n % 3`**
