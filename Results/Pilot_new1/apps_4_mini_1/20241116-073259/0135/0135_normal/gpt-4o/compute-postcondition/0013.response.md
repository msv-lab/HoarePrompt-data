According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4 for the loop to run again. Since `k` is currently unknown but must be at least 1, we can state that `k` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `seen_remainders` is an empty set; `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
