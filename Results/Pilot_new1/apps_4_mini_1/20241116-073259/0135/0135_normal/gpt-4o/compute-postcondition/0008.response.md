Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, the function continues execution without returning 'No', thus indicating that the current `remainder` has not been seen before.***
