According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented. Since `i` starts at 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be 2. Additionally, `seen_remainders` remains unchanged and the `remainder` is still 0, which has not been seen before.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0**
