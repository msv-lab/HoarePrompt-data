According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Additionally, since `seen_remainders` is an empty set, it does not affect the loop execution. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 2, while `seen_remainders` and `remainder` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 0**
