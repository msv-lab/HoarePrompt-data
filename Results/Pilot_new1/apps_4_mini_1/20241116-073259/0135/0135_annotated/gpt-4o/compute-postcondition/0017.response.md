The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, both of which must be in the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). The function first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is met, it immediately returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, it proceeds to calculate the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. 

During this process, it maintains a set of seen remainders. If a remainder is encountered more than once, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique throughout the loop, it ultimately returns 'Yes'. 

Notably, the function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, but since the constraints state that `k` must be at least 1, this edge case is not applicable. The function's behavior is consistent with the annotations in terms of returning values and conditions checked.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, returning 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, and returning 'No' if any remainder from `n % i` (for i from 1 to k) is repeated; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. **
