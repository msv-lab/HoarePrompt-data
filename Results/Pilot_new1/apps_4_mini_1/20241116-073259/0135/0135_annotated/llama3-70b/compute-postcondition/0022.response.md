The loop checks for duplicate remainders when dividing `n` by integers from `1` to `k`. If a remainder is already in the `seen` set, it exits the program with a message. 

If `k` is less than `1`, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set. 

Output State: **If `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains the unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from `1` to `k`, and if a duplicate remainder is found, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `seen` remains an empty set.**
