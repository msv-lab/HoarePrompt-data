The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. This action does not modify any variables; it simply outputs a message. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the function prints 'No'**.
