The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change due to the exit statement, but the program stops executing further code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as before the exit call.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and 'No' is printed.**
