Output State: **If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute `k` times, calculating `remainder` as `n % i` for `i` from 1 to `k`. If any `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function will return 'No'. After the loop, `seen_remainders` will contain the unique remainders from the divisions by 1 through `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set.**
