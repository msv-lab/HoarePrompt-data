According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as `range(1, k + 1)` produces a sequence starting from 1 up to and including `k`. The variable `i` will take on values from 1 to `k` during the iterations. Since `seen` is an empty set before the loop starts, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
