The values of `n` and `k` will be assigned the values provided as input, where both are integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `k` as they are determined by the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
