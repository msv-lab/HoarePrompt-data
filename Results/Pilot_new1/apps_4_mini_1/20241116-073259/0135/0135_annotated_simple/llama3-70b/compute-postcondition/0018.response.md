The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits before any further processing can occur. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables before the termination.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 3, and the output is 'No'**
