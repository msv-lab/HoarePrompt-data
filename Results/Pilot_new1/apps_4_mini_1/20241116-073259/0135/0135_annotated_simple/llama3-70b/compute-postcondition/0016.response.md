The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. Since `i` is 3, `remainder` will be calculated as `n % 3`. The previous value of `remainder` is `n % 2`, but it will be updated with the new calculation. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 3**
