To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and how it relates to the requirements.

### Code Analysis
The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of distinct remainders obtained from `n % i` for `i` ranging from `1` to `k`.

1. The loop iterates over each integer `i` from `1` to `k`.
2. For each `i`, it calculates the remainder `remainder = n % i`.
3. It checks if this `remainder` is already in the `seen` set.
   - If it is, it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If it is not, the remainder is added to the `seen` set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it prints 'Yes', indicating all remainders are distinct.

### Edge Cases and Considerations
- The program correctly handles the case when `k = 1`. The remainder `n % 1` is always `0`, so it should return 'No' since there's only one value.
- For larger values of `k`, the program should correctly identify duplicates in remainders.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case when `k` is less than `1`, but given the constraints (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), this situation should not occur.

### Potential Issue
However, let's consider a specific case:
- If `n` is equal to `k`, for example, `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders would be:
  - `4 % 1 = 0`
  - `4 % 2 = 0`
  - `4 % 3 = 1`
  - `4 % 4 = 0`
  
  Here, the remainders are not distinct (`0` appears multiple times).

Another case:
- If `n = 5` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1`
  - `5 % 5 = 0`
  
  Here, the remainders `0` and `1` appear multiple times.

### Conclusion
The program fails to correctly identify when `n % i` yields the same result for different values of `i`. Therefore, it does not meet the problem's requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
