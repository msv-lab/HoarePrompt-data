According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `n` is greater than 3, it will still be valid for the loop to execute again.

No changes are needed for `n`, `a`, or `m` since they do not affect the continuation of the loop in this context. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 4**
