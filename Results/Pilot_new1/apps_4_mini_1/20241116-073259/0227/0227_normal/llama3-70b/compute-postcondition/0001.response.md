The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into components. The input will consist of `n` distinct positive integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. Since the specific integers are not provided, the output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of integers based on the input. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers based on input.**
