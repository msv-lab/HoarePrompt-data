The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was either `False` or `True`, but it is now explicitly set to `True`. The other variables (`i`, `m`, `assigned`, `n`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is now True.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is now True**
