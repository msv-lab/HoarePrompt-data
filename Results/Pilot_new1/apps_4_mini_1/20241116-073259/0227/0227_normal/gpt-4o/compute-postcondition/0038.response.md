The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 3, and `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
