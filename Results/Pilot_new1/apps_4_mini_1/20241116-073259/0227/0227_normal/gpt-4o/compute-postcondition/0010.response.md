Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating a valid formation is possible. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False.***
