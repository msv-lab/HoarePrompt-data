The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `assigned` now contains the element `a[3]`, and `n` is greater than 3. Since `can_form` is now `False`, `m` will be increased by 1, but the exact previous value of `m` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1 (previous value unknown), `assigned` contains the element `a[3]`, `n` is greater than 3, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains the element `a[3]`, `n` is greater than 3, and `can_form` is False**
