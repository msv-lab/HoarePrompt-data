Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least one element, and `can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (where `x` is the first element in `assigned`) is found in `assigned`. If this condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, `m` is unchanged, and `i` is 2.***
