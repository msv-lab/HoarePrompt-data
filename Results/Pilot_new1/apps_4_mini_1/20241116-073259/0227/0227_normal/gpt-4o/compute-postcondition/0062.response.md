Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that `a[3] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such element exists after iterating through all elements in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[3]`), and `n` is greater than 3.**
