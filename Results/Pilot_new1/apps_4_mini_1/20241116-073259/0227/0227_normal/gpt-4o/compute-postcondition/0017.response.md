The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and at least one more distinct integer from `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is `a[1]`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
