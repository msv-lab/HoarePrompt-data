Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is increased by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to twice the element at index `i-1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i-1] * 2`, then `m` remains 1. Thus, `m` will be 2 if the condition is true, or it will stay 1 if the condition is false.***
