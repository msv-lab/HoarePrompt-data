The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means that `a` will be populated with `n` distinct positive integers provided by the user as input. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, but the state of `a` changes to contain the integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers based on user input**
