The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the states of `n`, `i`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, and `x` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `m` is 2, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `m` is 2, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
