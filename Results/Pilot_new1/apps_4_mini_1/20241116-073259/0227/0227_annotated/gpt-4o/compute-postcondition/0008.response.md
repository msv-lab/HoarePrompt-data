The statement `can_form = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `can_form`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, so now it changes to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `x`) remain unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.**
