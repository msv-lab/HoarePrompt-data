The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `m` is 2, `x` is the third element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**.
