The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, and the states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of the assigned list, and the value of (a[2] - x) is an element of the `assigned` list.

Output State: **`assigned` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of the assigned list, and the value of (a[2] - x) is an element of the `assigned` list.**
