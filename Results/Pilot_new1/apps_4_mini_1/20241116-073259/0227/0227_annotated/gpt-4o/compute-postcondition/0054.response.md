The variable `can_form` is explicitly assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not depend on any previous calculations or values, and it overrides the previous state of `can_form`. The values of `assigned` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `can_form` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`assigned` is a non-empty list, `i` is 3, `can_form` is True**
