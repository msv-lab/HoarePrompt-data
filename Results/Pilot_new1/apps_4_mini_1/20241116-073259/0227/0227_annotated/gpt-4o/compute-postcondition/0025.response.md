According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, since `i` is now 2, it will refer to the next element in the sorted list `a`, which is `a[2]`. 

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop's iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `x` is the last element checked from `assigned`**
