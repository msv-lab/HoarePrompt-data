The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `x` is the last element checked from `assigned`, and `can_form` is False**
