Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` is not equal to twice the element at index `i - 1`. If `a[i]` is equal to `2 * a[i - 1]`, then `m` remains 1. In the case where `i` is 1, if `a[1]` is not equal to `2 * a[0]`, then `m` will be 2, otherwise, it will stay 1.***
