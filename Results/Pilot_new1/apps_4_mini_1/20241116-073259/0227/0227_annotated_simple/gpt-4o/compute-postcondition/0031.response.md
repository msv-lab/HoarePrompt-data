Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially. If the difference between `a[1]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating that a valid formation is possible, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. The variable `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.***
