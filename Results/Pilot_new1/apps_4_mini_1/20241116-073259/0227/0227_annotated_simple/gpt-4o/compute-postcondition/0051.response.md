The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[1]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
