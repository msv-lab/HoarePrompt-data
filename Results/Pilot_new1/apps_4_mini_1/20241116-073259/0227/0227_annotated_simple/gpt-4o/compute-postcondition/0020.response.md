Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that element is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains at least one element, the loop will execute for each element in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False.**
