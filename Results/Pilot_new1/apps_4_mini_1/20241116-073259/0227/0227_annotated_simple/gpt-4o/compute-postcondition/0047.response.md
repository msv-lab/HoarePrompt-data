The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables (`assigned`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is set to False.

Output State: **`assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is set to False**
