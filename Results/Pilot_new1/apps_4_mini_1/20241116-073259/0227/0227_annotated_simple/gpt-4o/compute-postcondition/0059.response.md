The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop.
