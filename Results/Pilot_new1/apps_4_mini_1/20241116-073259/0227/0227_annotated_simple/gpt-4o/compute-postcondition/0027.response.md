According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` variable. Since `assigned` includes `a[i]` and `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `assigned` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Given that `assigned` includes `a[i]`, and `i` is 1, `assigned` must contain `a[1]`. For the loop to execute, we also need to consider the state of `can_form`. Although `can_form` being False does not prevent the loop from executing, it may be relevant for the logic within the loop body.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `assigned` is not empty and includes the element `a[1]`. 

State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` includes `a[1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
