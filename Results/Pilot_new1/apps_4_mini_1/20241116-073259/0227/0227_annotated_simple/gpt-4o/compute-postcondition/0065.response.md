Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `assigned` is empty or does not contain any element such that the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `assigned` remains unchanged. If `assigned` contains elements but `can_form` is still False, the same conditions hold true.***
