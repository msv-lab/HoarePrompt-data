The code increments `remocrats` by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` was either 0 (if the first character was 'D') or 1 (if the first character was not 'D'). Since `remocrats` is being incremented by 1, its new value will be either 1 or 2. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`, and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`, `remocrats` is either 1 or 2**
