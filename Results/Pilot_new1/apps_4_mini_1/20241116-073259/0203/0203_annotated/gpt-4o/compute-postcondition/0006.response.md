The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the `d_queue`. The initial state shows that `d_queue` is an empty list, so after this operation, `d_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D'**
