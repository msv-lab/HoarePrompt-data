The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation, as `d_queue` is a new variable being created. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `n` and `votes`, along with the new state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the input string with whitespace stripped; `d_queue` is an empty list**
