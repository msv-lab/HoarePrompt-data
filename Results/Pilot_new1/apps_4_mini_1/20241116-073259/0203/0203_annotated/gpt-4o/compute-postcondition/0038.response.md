Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less element and now contains the value `d_index` (the first element removed from `d_queue`). If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n` appended to it. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` has one less element and now includes the value `r_index + n`, while `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`.***
