The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Since `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue` and `n` is an additional value, the state of `r_queue` will change to include this new element. The values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and the previous state of `r_queue` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_queue` now has one less element, `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now includes `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_queue` now has one less element, `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now includes `r_index + n**.
