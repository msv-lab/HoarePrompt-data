The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` contains at least one index, this operation will successfully retrieve that index and modify `d_queue` by removing the first element. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected since it is not involved in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_queue` is not empty**
