The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent two fractions of the employees. 

After executing the function body, the function returns a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string. The specifics of the return value depend on the comparison of these counts. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string votes of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the votes string.**
