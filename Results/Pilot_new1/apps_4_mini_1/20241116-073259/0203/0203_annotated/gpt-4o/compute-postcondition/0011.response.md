The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is equal to the length of the string `votes`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, `d_queue` will now include the length of `votes` as a new element. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `votes` is non-empty, `i` will always be a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`; `d_queue` now includes the length of `votes` as a new element.**
