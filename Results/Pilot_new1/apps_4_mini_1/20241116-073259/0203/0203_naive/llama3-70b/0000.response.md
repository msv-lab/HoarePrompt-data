Correctness: **False**.

The provided program counts the number of employees from each fraction (depublicans and remocrats) and prints the outcome based solely on which fraction has more employees. However, the problem description specifies a more complex voting procedure where employees can deny others the right to vote, and this can significantly affect the outcome.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this scenario, the employees can deny each other the right to vote in a strategic manner. The first employee (D) could deny the second employee (R), the third employee (D) could deny the fourth employee (R), and so on. The outcome is not simply determined by counting the number of 'D's and 'R's but rather by the strategic actions taken during the voting process.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, leading to incorrect outcomes in various scenarios.
