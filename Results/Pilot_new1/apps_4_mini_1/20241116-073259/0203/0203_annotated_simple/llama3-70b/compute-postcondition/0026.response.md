The function accepts an integer input `n`, which represents the length of a subsequent string input `fractions`. The string `fractions` consists of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function counts the occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and any other characters (remocrats) in the string. After processing the input, if the count of 'D' characters is greater than the count of other characters, the function prints 'D'. If the counts are equal or if there are more other characters than 'D', it prints 'R'. 

An important edge case to note is that if `fractions` is an empty string, the counts for both depublicans and remocrats will be zero, leading the function to print 'R' since there are no 'D' characters. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and prints 'D' if there are more 'D's than other characters; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `fractions` is empty, it defaults to printing 'R'. **
