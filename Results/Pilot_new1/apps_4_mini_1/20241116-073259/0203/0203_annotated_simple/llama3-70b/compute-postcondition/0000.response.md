The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), but the specific value of `n` is unknown as it is determined by user input. Other variables, such as `fractions`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` remains unchanged**
