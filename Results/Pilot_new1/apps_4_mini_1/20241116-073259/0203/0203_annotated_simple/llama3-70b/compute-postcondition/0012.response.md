The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. However, the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining; `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000); `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character remaining; `remocrats` is increased by 1**
