The value of `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed by the `pop(0)` method. The state of `r_queue` will change as its first element is removed, but `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `r_queue` is non-empty after removing its first element; `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`; and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `r_queue` is non-empty after removing its first element; `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`**
