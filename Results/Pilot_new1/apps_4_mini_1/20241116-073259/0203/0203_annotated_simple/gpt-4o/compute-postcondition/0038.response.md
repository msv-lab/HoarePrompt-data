Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are both non-empty after the execution. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is updated by appending `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated by appending `r_index + n`. In either case, `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.***
