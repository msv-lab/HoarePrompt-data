Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is 'D', otherwise `d_queue` is empty. In the case where the first character of `votes` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains the index 0, while `d_queue` remains empty.***
