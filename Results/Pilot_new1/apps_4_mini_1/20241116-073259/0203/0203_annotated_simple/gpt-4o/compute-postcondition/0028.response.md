The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` is non-empty, this operation will successfully retrieve a value from it. The state of `d_queue` will change to no longer include the first element, while `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `r_queue` is non-empty; `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`**.
