The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed, and `n` is an unspecified integer. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue` after the append operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` is non-empty after removing the first element, `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed, and `r_queue` now includes `r_index + n`.**
