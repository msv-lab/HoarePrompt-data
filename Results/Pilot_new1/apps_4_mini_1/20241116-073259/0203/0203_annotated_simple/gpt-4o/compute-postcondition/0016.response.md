The code appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The value of `i` is `n + 1`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` will be in the range of 2 to 200,001. The state of other variables, including `votes` and `v`, is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `n + 1`, and `r_queue` now includes the value `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is `n + 1`, and `r_queue` now includes the value `i`**
