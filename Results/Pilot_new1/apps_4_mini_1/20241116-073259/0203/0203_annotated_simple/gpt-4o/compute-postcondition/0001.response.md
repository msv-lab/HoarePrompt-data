The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes user input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string with whitespace removed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string with whitespace removed.**
