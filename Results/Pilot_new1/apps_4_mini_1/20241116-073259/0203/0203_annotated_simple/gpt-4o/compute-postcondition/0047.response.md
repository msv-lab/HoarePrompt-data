Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It simulates a voting process where each character represents a vote. The function processes the votes by comparing the indices of 'D' and 'R', appending the indices back to their respective queues with an offset of `n` until one of the queues is empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if there are any remaining 'D' votes, or 'R' if all 'D' votes have been processed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Edge cases include handling of empty input for `votes`, which is not explicitly checked in the code, and the assumption that `n` is always a valid positive integer.**
