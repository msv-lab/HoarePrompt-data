Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes exactly `n` times, processing each character in `fractions`.**
