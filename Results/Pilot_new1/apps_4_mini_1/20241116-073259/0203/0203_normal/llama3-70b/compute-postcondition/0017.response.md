Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 - 1; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; if `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. In all cases, `fraction` must be a valid character from the string `fractions` that corresponds to the next character in the sequence.***
