According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `fractions` string and the current position in the string. The loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. The loop will execute for each character in `fractions`, and if the last character has been processed, the loop cannot execute again. 

Since the loop iterates over `fractions`, if the last processed character is at position `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the index of the last character processed. 

If `n` is greater than 1, the next character would be the one at index `n`, which does not exist, meaning `n` must be adjusted to indicate that we have processed all characters. Thus, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n-1` to indicate that there is one less character to process.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 - 1; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the next character in the string (if it exists)**.
