The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the second character in `fractions` (if it exists); and `depublicans` is increased by 1.
