Postcondition: ***`depublicans` and `remocrats` are non-negative integers representing the counts of 'D' and 'R' characters in `fractions`. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the output is 'D'. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the output is 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string (length 0), both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and no output is produced.***
