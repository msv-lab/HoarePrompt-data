The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue` as `r_queue.pop(0)` removes that element from `r_queue`. The `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
