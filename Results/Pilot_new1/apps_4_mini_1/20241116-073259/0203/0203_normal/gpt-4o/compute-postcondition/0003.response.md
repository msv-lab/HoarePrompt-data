The variable `r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `votes` remain unchanged, and `d_queue` continues to be an empty list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**.
