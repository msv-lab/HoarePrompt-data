Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, the function prints 'D' and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged. If `d_queue` is empty, the function prints 'R', and both queues remain unchanged. If both queues were empty before execution, they remain empty and the function still prints 'R'.***
