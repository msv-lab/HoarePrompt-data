The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which takes input from the user and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` does not affect this assignment, and no other variables are impacted. Therefore, the output state reflects that `votes` is now a string containing the user input, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string**
