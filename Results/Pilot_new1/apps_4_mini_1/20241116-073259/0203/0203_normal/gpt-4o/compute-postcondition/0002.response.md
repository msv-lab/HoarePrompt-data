The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed or impacted by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `d_queue` while keeping `n` and `votes` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string; `d_queue` is an empty list**
