The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are also integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, the function returns the total time calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the total time based on the calculated values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, and returns the total time calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor.**
