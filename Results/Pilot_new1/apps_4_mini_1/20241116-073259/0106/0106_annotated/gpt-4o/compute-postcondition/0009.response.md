To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

1. The variables `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are already defined based on their respective calculations.
2. The line of code `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)` assigns `min_walk_time` the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
3. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are not changed by this operation, only `min_walk_time` is affected.

Since the exact values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are not provided, we cannot specify the numerical output for `min_walk_time`, but we can state that it takes the minimum of the two calculated times.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
