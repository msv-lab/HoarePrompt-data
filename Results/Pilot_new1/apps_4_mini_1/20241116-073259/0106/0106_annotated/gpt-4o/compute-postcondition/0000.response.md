To determine the output state based on the provided initial state and code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code.

The code calculates the block number for a given apartment number using the formula:

```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

1. The variable `apartment` represents the apartment number, which is an integer within the range defined (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k).
2. The variables `m` and `k` are positive integers, and their product `m * k` represents the number of apartments per block.
3. The expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k)` computes the zero-based index of the block that the apartment belongs to, and adding 1 converts it to a one-based index.

Since the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not specified beyond their constraints, we can only state the relationship without specific numerical values.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculation of `block` based on the general formula provided.

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, where apartment is either a or b, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.**
