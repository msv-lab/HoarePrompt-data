The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The parameter `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number, with the constraint that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers between 1 and 1000. The function returns the values of `block` and `floor`, where `floor` is calculated based on the formula `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return its corresponding `block` and `floor` values based on the specified calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the apartment number and the given values of n, m, and k.**
