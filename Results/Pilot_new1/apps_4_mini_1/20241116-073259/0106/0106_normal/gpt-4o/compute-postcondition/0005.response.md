Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` within a building layout defined by parameters `m` (number of floors per block) and `k` (number of apartments per floor). It returns a tuple containing the calculated `block` number and `floor` number based on the apartment number. However, the function relies on the external definitions of `m` and `k`, which are not provided in the code, leading to potential errors if they are not defined prior to the function call.**
