Output State: **`n` retains its previous value, `m` retains its previous value, `k` retains its previous value, `a_block` is calculated from user input values of `a` and `m`, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, and `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
