The value of `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their previous values, while `a` is obtained from user input. Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, alongside the new value of `a_block`, which depends on the input values of `a`, `m`, and `k`.

Output State: **`n` retains its previous value, `m` retains its previous value, `k` retains its previous value, `a_block` is calculated from user input values of `a` and `m`.**
