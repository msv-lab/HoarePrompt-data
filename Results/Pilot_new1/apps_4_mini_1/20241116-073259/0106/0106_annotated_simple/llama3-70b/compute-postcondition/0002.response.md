The value of `a_floor` is calculated using the expression `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `a` and `m` are input positive integers, which means they are greater than 0. The operation `(a - 1) % m` computes the remainder of `a - 1` divided by `m`, and then 1 is added to that result.

Since `a` and `m` are positive integers, the calculation of `a_floor` will yield a positive integer value as well. 

Therefore, the output state includes the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and the newly calculated `a_floor`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `a_floor` is a positive integer calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1**
