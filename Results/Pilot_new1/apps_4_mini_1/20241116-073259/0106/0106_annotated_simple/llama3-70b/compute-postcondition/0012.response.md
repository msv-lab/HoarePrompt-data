Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are positive integers; `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `b_floor`, and `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 while `b_block` remains based on an undefined value of `b`; the output of the print statement cannot be determined due to the undefined value of `min_floor_time`.**
