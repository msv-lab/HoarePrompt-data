`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, and `k` is a positive integer, which means `m * k` is also a positive integer. The calculation involves integer division of `(a - 1)` by `(m * k)`, which gives the number of complete blocks of size `m * k` that fit in `a - 1`, and then we add 1 to count the current block. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the output state includes the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and the computed value of `a_block`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
