The variable `floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, but since we don't have the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we can only express `floor` in terms of `floor_within_block` and `k`. 

Thus, `floor` will be calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`, where `floor_within_block` is derived from the initial state. The other variables `block` and `floor_within_block` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`block` is a positive integer calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is calculated as floor_within_block // k + 1**
