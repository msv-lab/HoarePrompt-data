The variable `block` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The initial state indicates that `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number, which must be between 1 and `n * m * k`, and `m` and `k` are also positive integers. 

Since `apartment` is not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `block`. However, we can state that `block` will be a positive integer representing the block number in which the apartment resides.

The output state will reflect the relationships and calculations based on the provided information, without specific values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`.

Output State: **`block` is a positive integer calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
