Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
