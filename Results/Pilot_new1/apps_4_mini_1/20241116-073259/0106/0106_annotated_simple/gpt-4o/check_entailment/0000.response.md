To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function calculates the block ( подъезд) and floor ( этаж) of a given apartment number.
   - The calculations seem correct:
     - `block` is computed as the integer division of `(apartment - 1)` by the total number of apartments in a block (`m * k`).
     - `floor_within_block` is the remainder when dividing by the total number of apartments in a block.
     - `floor` is computed correctly based on `floor_within_block`.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - The function first retrieves the block and floor for both Edward's (`a`) and Natasha's (`b`) apartments using `get_location`.
   - It calculates `time_to_exit`:
     - If Edward is on the first floor (`floor_a == 1`), `time_to_exit` is 0.
     - If not, it takes 10 seconds to call the elevator plus the time to go down `(floor_a - 1)` floors.
   - It computes the walking time between blocks:
     - `direct_walk_time` is calculated for walking directly to Natasha's block.
     - `reverse_walk_time` is for walking in the opposite direction.
     - The minimum of these two times is taken as `min_walk_time`.
   - Finally, it calculates the time to reach Natasha's floor and sums everything up to return `total_time`.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Edge Case of Same Block**:
   - If `a` and `b` are in the same block but on different floors, the program should correctly compute the time without any block travel.
   - For example, if `a = 1` (block 1, floor 1) and `b = 6` (block 1, floor 1), it should not add any block travel time.

2. **Edge Case of Different Blocks**:
   - If `a` is in the last block and `b` is in the first block (e.g., `a = n * m * k` and `b = 1`), it should correctly compute the time for both clockwise and counterclockwise travel.

3. **Minimum Input Values**:
   - For the smallest values of `n`, `m`, and `k` (all equal to 1), the program should handle this case correctly.

4. **Maximum Input Values**:
   - The program should handle the maximum input sizes efficiently and correctly compute the time.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the code and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program implements the logic correctly according to the problem description. The calculations for time spent in the elevator, walking between blocks, and moving between floors seem to be handled appropriately.

Therefore, I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Hence, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
