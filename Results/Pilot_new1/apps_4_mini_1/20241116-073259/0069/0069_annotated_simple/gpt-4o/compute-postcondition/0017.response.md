The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the evaluation of the expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The variable `i` is `n + 1`, and `prefix_balances[1]` is already updated. Therefore, the calculation for `prefix_balances[i]` will depend on the specific values of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and `s[i - 1]`. 

Since we do not have the specific values of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` or `s[i - 1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `prefix_balances[i]`. However, we know that `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated accordingly.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
