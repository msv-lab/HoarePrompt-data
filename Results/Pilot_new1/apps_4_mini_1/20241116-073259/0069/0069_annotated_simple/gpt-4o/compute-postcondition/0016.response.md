According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and increments by 1 after each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is likely equal to `n` (since the loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`), which means this iteration has completed. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`, and the loop will not execute again since `i` will be outside the range of `1` to `n`.

The state of `prefix_balances` does not need to be adjusted, as it is updated based on the current iteration of the loop.

State: **`prefix_balances[2]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[1]` and the value of `s[1]`; `i` is `n + 1`.**
