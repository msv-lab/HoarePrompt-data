Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `(x - b)` is not divisible by `balance` or `(x - b) // balance` is negative, `count` remains unchanged.***
