The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents an input value that is converted to an integer. The values of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, `x`, `results`, and `T`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` based on the input, while the other variables maintain their previous states.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index]**
