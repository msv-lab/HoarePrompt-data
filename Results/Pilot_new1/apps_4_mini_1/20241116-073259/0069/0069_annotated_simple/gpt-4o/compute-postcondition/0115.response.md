Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the cumulative balance based on the string `s`. If the final balance is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains 0. If the final balance is not 0, `count` reflects the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` has `count` appended. Additionally, the edge case where `n` is 0 or less is not applicable here, as `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1, ensuring that the loop executes and `prefix_balances` is properly populated.***
