According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute. Given the conditions stated, if `balance` is equal to 0, then `results` contains -1 if `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and 0 otherwise. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` must be calculated, and `results` will contain the value of `count`. 

To ensure the loop can execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to check the conditions that lead to `results` being populated. If `balance` is 0, then `x` must be an element of `prefix_balances` for `results` to contain -1. If `balance` is not 0, then `count` must be greater than 0 for `results` to be populated.

Thus, to ensure the loop executes, we need to modify the state to reflect that `results` contains at least one value. Assuming `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, we can set `results` to contain -1. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1**
