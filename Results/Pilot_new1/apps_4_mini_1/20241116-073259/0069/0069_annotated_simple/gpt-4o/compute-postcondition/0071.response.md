Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is the last updated value in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.***
