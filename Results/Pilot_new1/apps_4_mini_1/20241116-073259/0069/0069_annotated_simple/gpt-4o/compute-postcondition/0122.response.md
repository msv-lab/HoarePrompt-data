According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least three elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least two elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must contain at least three elements. Additionally, the `result` should be the third element in the list, and the loop counter should be updated accordingly.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list**
