Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is an integer. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for all cases where `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, and ensures that the output is correctly calculated based on the relationship between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program should handle this case separately as it may lead to division by zero, which is not explicitly covered in the current logic.***
