The variable `balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are previously defined as the counts of '0's and '1's in the input string `s`. Therefore, the new value of `balance` will reflect the difference between these counts. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is an input string**
