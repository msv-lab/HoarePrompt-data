Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1, indicating no valid solution exists. Otherwise, the function prints the result of \((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1\), which represents the calculated number based on the relationship between `x`, `balance`, and the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special attention is needed since the division by zero would occur; thus, the program should ensure that `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero when performing the modulus or division operations.***
