The code prints `-1`, which does not change the values of any variables. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is 100; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s'; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`T` is 100; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.**
