The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, respectively. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not known, but they will now reflect the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`. The variable `balance` will also be updated accordingly based on the new values of `cnt0` and `cnt1`, as `balance` is defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the new counts of '0's and '1's and the updated balance.

Output State: **`T` is 100; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
