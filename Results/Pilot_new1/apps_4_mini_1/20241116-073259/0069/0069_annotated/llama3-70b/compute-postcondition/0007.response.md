The code `print(n + 1)` outputs the value of `n + 1`. The variable `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we can only express the result in terms of `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, the balance is equal to `x`, and the function prints `n + 1`.**
