Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the output is -1 if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`; otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and `balance` is not equal to `x`, the loop must handle this edge case to avoid division by zero, and in such cases, the output is undefined. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged.**
