Postcondition: ***`T` is 100; `n`, `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is the integer division of the adjusted value by the difference in counts, plus one. This accounts for cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a potential division by zero, which should be managed separately in practice.***
