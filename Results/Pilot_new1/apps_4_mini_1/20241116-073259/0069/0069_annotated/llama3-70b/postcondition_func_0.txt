The function accepts a positive integer `T`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a binary string `s`. It counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`, computes the balance between these counts, and then determines the output based on the relationship between `balance` and `x`. If `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `balance` does not equal `x` and the counts of '0' and '1' are equal, the output is undefined. If the counts are not equal, it checks if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` to print `-1`, otherwise it computes and prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function handles up to 100 test cases, and if `T` is 0 or negative, it does not execute any test cases.
