Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones in the string `s` up to index `i`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' in `s` up to the `i`-th character. `balance` is not equal to 0, indicating there is an imbalance of zeros and ones in `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `1` filled with zeros.***
