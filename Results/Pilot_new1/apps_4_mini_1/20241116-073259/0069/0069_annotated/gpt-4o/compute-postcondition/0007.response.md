The variable `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 1` equals 2. The value of `data[2]` will be converted to an integer and assigned to `x`. Since `data` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the specific value of `x`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])**
