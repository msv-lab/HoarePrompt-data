Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If `balance` is 0, and if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes `-1`. If `x` is not present, `results` includes `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and `results` includes this `count`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and no iteration occurs.***
