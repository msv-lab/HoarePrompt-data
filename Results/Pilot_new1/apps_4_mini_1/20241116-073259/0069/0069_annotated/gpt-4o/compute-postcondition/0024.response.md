The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is `0`, and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. The appending operation does not change the values of `prefix_balances` or `balance`, but it modifies the `results` list by adding a new element.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is not present in the `prefix_balances` list, and `results` now includes an additional element `0`.**
