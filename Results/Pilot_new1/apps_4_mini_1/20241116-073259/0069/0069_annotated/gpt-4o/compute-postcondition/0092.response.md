According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, which means that the loop has just reached its upper limit and will not execute again. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`. Since `n` is unchanged, there are no adjustments needed for `n`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be updated to `n + 1`.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `s[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
