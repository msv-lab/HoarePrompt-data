The value of `index` is incremented by 3. This affects the `index` variable while the other variables (`balance`, `x`, `results`, `T`, `n`, and `s`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `index` after the increment.

Output State: **`balance` is 0 or not 0; `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`; `results` reflects the last operation; `T` is greater than the number of iterations completed so far; `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]; `index` is increased by 3.**
