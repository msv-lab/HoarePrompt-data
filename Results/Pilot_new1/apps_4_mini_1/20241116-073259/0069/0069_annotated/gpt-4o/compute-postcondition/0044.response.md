The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is expected to be a valid input that can be converted to an integer. The previous state of `x` is not provided, but it is now defined as an integer. Other variables such as `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, and `n` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is now an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than 1, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is now an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than 1, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])**
