The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `x` using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input from the user, splits it into parts, and converts those parts into integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not specified, so we cannot determine their exact values after this operation. However, we know that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5) and `x` is also a positive integer (1 <= x <= 10^9). 

The output state will reflect that `n` and `x` have been assigned new values based on user input, while the previous states of these variables are not provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is a positive integer (1 <= x <= 10^9)**
