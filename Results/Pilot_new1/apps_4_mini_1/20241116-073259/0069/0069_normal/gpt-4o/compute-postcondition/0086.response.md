According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, as the range is from 1 to `n + 1`. Additionally, the loop variable `i` will start at 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 to allow the loop to run. The initial value of `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`balance` is `count_0 - count_1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 1**
