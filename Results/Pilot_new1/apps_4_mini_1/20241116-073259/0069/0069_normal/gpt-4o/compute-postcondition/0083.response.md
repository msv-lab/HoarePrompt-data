The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The other variables `balance`, `x`, `results`, `T`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `index` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2] and `index` is increased by 3.**
