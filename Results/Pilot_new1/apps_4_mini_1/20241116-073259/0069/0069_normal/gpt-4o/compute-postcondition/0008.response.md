The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `s` will take the value of `data[3]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `data` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is the value of `data[3]`, and `results` is an empty list.
