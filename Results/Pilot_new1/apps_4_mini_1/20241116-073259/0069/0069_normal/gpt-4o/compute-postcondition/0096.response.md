The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of `results`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `x`, `T`, `s`, and `index` are unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `results` list while the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains cumulative values based on the characters in `s`, `balance` is 0, `x`, `results` now includes -1, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged**.
