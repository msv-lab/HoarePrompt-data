According to the code, the loop will execute for a total of `T` iterations. The variable `_` is a placeholder indicating that we are not using the loop variable itself. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `T`.

At the end of the last iteration, there is no explicit state provided for `_`, but we can infer that if the loop has executed `T` times, then `_` would be equal to `T - 1` at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` would need to be less than `T`, meaning that we need to adjust `_` to `T` since it will increment by 1 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions and states related to `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `x`, and `results` are not directly affected by the loop control variable.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing cumulative balances of '0's and '1's, initialized to 0 at index 0, `_` is T**
