According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. The loop will execute for each element in the `prefix_balances` list, which has a length of `n + 1`. Since `prefix_balances` is a list, it will have at least one element (when `n` is 0) for the loop to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed correctly, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances` has at least one element, and `b` will be the first element in the list. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 1, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0**
