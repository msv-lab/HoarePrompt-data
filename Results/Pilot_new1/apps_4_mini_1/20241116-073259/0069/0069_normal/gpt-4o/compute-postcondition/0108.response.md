Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least two elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, and `balance` is not equal to 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased to 2. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged at 1. The values of `x`, `results`, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged.***
