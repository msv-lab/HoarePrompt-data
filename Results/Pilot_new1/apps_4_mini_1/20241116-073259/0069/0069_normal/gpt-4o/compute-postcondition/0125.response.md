Output State: **If `results` contains at least one element, the loop will execute and print each element in `results`. If `results` is empty, the loop does not execute, and nothing is printed. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; if not, it contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is valid for `results`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list.**
