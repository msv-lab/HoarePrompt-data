Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least three elements, `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `x`, `results`, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
