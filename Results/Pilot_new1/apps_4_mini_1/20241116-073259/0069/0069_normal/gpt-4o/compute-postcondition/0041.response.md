Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing cumulative balances of '0's and '1's, initialized to 0 at index 0. If `balance` is 0 and `x` exists in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` does not exist in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes the value of `count`. This ensures all edge cases concerning the values of `x` and the conditions on `balance` are handled.***
