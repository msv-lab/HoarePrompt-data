The value of `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`. The variable `min_pos` holds the index of `1` in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist3` will be equal to the absolute value of `-min_pos`, which is simply `min_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of `1` in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, and `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`**.
