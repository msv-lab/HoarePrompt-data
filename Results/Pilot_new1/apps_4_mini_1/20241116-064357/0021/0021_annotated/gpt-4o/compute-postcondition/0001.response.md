The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers, `split()` breaks that string into individual components, and `map(int, ...)` converts each component to an integer. The previous value of `a` is not specified, but it will be replaced by the new list of integers. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`, and `a` is now updated to the new list of integers.
