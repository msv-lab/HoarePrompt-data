The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot detail return values. However, we can summarize the inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
