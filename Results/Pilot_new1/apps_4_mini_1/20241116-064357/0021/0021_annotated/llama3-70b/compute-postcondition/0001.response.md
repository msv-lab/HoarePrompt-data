The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means that `a` will now contain a list of integers that the user inputs, with the assumption that the input will consist of `n` distinct integers within the range from 1 to `n`. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged, but `a` will now hold the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input.**
