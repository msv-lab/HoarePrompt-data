The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `a` contains distinct integers from input, we need to determine the impact of this line of code. 

However, the specific position of `n` in the list `a` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `posn`. 

The output state reflects that `posn` will be the index where `n` is located in `a`, but since the exact index is unknown, we state that `posn` is determined based on the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`**
