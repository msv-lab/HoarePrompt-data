To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires us to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.

The program does the following:
1. It reads the integer n and the list a of n distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates four potential distances:
   - Distance from the start of the list (index 0) to the maximum element's position.
   - Distance from the end of the list (index n-1) to the maximum element's position.
   - Distance from the start of the list (index 0) to the minimum element's position.
   - Distance from the end of the list (index n-1) to the minimum element's position.
4. It then selects the maximum of these distances and prints it.

Now, let's consider the edge cases:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the list. For example, if the input is `2` and the list is `[1, 2]`, the output should be `1` since they are already at the maximum distance.
- The program calculates distances based on the current positions of the elements without considering that a swap may not always yield a new maximum distance. For instance, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the maximum distance is already 4 (between positions 0 and 4), and swapping any two elements will not increase this distance further.

Thus, the program does not correctly account for the requirement of performing exactly one swap to achieve the maximum distance, as it only considers the distances from the current positions without evaluating the potential effect of a swap.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to consider cases where the swap does not lead to a greater distance than the initial arrangement, and it does not evaluate the effectiveness of the swap properly. For example, in the case of the input `2` with the list `[1, 2]`, the output should be `1`, but the program's logic would not yield a valid maximum distance after a swap.
