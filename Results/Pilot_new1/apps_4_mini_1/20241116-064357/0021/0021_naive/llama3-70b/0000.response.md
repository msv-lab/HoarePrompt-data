To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nicholas has a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n. He wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the size of the permutation `n` and the permutation itself into the list `a`.

2. **Finding Positions**: It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and maximum element (n) using `index()`.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - It calculates `max_dist` as the maximum of the current distance minus one and `n - 2`. However, this logic seems flawed because it doesn't guarantee that the swap will always yield the maximum distance.
   - `min_dist` is calculated similarly, but it is not used correctly in the context of maximizing the distance after a swap.

4. **Final Output**: The program prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`, which does not align with the requirement to perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance.

### Potential Case Analysis:
A critical case to consider is when the permutation is already in such a way that the minimum and maximum elements are at the ends of the array. For example:
- Input: 
```
2
1 2
```
- Expected Output: `1` (the distance is already maximized)
- Actual Output: The logic in the program will not correctly handle this case since it will return `0` due to the way distances are calculated.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the distance after exactly one swap for all potential cases. Therefore, it fails for at least one input case.

Correctness: **False**.
