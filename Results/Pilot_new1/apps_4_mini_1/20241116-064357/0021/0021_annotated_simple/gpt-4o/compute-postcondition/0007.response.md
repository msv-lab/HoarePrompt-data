The variable `dist4` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The value of `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `min_pos` is an index that is not specified in the initial state. The value of `dist4` will depend on the specific value of `min_pos`, which is not provided.

Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `dist4` based on the values of `n` and `min_pos`, but since `min_pos` is unknown, we cannot compute a specific value for `dist4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`**
