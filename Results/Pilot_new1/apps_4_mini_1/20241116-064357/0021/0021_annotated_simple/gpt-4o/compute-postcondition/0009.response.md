Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, and the value of `max_distance` is printed.**
