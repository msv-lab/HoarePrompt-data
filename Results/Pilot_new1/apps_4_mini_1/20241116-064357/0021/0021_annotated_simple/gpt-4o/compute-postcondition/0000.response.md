`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing values from 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing values from 1 to n**
