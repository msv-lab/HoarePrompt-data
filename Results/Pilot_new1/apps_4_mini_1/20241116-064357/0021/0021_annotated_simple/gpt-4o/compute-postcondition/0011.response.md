Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers containing values from 1 to n. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and n in the list to either end of the list (index 0 or index n-1) and prints this maximum distance. The function assumes that both 1 and n are present in the list, and it does not handle cases where these values are missing, which could lead to a ValueError. **
