The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must be between 2 and 100 inclusive. The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, representing a permutation of size `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified logic (not detailed here). 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive), representing a permutation of size `n`.**
