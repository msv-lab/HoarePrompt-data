Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive), representing a permutation of size `n`. It calculates the maximum and minimum distances between the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list, and prints the maximum distance adjusted by the size of the list. The function does not handle cases where the input format is invalid, such as if `a` does not contain both `1` and `n`, which could lead to a ValueError. **
