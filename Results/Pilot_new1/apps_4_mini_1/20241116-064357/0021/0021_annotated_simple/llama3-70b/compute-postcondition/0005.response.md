To determine the output state, we start with the provided initial state and analyze the impact of the code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is assigned the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (n - 2).

The code snippet provided is:
```
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
```

1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum of two values:
   - The first value is `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`, which calculates the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracts 1 from that result.
   - The second value is `n - 2`, which is derived directly from the value of `n`.

2. The variables `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are already defined in the initial state, but we need to ensure that `pos1` has a concrete value to compute `min_dist`.

3. The output state will include the values of `n`, `posn`, `max_dist`, and `min_dist`. Since `min_dist` is calculated based on the values of `pos1` and `posn`, we will indicate that `min_dist` is determined by those calculations.

Since `pos1` is not defined in the initial state, we will mention that `min_dist` depends on `pos1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is assigned the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (n - 2); `min_dist` is determined by min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
