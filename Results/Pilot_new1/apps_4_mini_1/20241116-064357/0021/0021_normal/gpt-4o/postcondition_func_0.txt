The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list and the edges of the list (positions `0` and `n-1`). It then prints this maximum distance. The function does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, which would raise a `ValueError`.
