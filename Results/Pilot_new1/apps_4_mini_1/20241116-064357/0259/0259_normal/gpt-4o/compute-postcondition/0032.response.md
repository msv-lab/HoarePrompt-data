Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged. After incrementing `i` by 1 and assigning `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[i]`, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative value since it represents the waiting time for the next bus.***
