The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, but `chosen_route` will be one greater than whatever value `i` holds. The value of `min_wait_time` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `chosen_route` based on the unknown value of `i`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
