To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The code snippet assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`.
2. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`, which depend on the values in the list `bus_routes` at index `i`.

Since the initial state mentions that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, but does not provide specific values for `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, or `wait_time`, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time` or `min_wait_time`. However, we know that `min_wait_time` will be updated to the value of `wait_time`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `min_wait_time` is updated based on the calculated `wait_time`, while `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` remains unchanged**
