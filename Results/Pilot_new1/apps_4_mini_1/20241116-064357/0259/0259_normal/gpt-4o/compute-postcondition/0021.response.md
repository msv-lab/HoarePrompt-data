The value of `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, and since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `s_i` and `d_i` will also be specific integers based on the values in the `bus_routes` list. The variable `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000. The calculation of `wait_time` is dependent on these values.

As a result, `wait_time` will be determined by the specific values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
