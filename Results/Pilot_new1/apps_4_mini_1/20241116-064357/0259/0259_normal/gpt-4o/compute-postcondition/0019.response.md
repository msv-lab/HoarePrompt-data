The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are known, where `s_i` is the departure time from the bus_routes for the index `n` and `t` is a given integer. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`; `min_wait_time` is unchanged; `chosen_route` is unchanged; `i` is `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
