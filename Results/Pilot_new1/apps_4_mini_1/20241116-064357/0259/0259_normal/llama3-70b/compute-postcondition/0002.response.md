According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, the loop variable is not explicitly defined in the state before the loop starts, so we need to account for that.

Since the loop variable is represented by an underscore (`_`), it is typically used to indicate that the value is not important, but it is still a placeholder for the iterations. Thus, we can set it to 0 for the first iteration.

The list `buses` is empty, but it doesn't affect the execution of the loop itself since the loop does not depend on its contents.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
