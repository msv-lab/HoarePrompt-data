Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 3 tuples, `t` is a positive integer, `_` is n, `i` is 2, and `(s, d)` is the third tuple in `buses`. If `time`, calculated as (t - s) % d, is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
