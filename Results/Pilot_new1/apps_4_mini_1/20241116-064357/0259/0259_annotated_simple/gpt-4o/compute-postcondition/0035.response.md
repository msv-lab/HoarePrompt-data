The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `chosen_route` is either one more than whatever value `i` holds. The state of `min_wait_time` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
