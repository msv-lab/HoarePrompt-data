According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, which is outside the bounds of the loop defined by `range(n)`.

Since `i` is currently `n - 1`, it will not allow the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect that the loop has completed all iterations from `0` to `n - 1`, and no further iterations can occur. 

No other states need to be adjusted as the values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time`, and `min_wait_time` will remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`**
