Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains the start time and interval of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on their schedules and returns the 1-based index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time. If no valid bus routes are found (e.g., if `n` is 0 or all bus routes have start times less than `t` and do not align with `t`), it returns -1, indicating no suitable bus route is available. **
