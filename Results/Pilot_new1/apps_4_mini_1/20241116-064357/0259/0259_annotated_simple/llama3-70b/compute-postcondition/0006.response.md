The code assigns the values of `s` and `d` by taking input, which is split into two parts and converted into integers. The previous values of `s` and `d` are not known since they are being assigned new values from the input. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n`, and `s` and `d` are assigned values from input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n`, and `s` and `d` are assigned values from input.**
