The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list, so after executing the code, `buses` will contain one element, which is the tuple `(s, d)`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 0**
