The values of `n` and `t` are assigned from the input, which is split and converted to integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `t` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000**
