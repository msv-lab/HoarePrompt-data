According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as the value of `_` (which is `n`) is less than the specified limit. 

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, meaning that `n` must be greater than the current value of `_`.

Since `_` is equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration, to allow for another iteration, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than the current value of `_`. Therefore, we can set `n` to be `n + 1`, ensuring that the loop can execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n`, `s` is the input value, `d` is the input value**
