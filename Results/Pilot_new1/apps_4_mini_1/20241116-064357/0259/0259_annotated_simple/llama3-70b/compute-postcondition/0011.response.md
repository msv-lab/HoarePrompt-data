According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` (which is equal to `n`) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is `n`, which means the loop has completed all its iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased. Since `n` is currently a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, it can remain unchanged in this context but cannot be less than or equal to `_`. 

Thus, to allow for an additional iteration, we need to adjust `_` to be `n + 1` (which is greater than `n`). The other states can remain unchanged since they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` now contains the original tuple(s) and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n + 1`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
