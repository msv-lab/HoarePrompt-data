The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the existing list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers. The initial state of the `buses` list is not explicitly mentioned, but it contains at least one original tuple. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` now contains the original tuple(s) and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
