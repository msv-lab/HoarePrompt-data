The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list**
