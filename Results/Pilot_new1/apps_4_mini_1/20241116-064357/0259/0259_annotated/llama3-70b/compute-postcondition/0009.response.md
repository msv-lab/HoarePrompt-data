The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are converted to integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `s` and `d`, as they are dependent on user input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that n is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing two tuples (the original tuple and (s, d)), `_` is 2, and `s` and `d` are input integers.
