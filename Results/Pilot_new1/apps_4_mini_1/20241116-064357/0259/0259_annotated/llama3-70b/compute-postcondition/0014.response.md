The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as this assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `min_time` is set to positive infinity, and `ans` is -1.
