According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. The loop will execute if there is at least 1 tuple in the `buses` list. Given that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, it implies that `buses` contains `n` tuples, meaning it is not empty. 

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, and the first tuple `(s, d)` in the `buses` list will be the first tuple in the iteration. 

State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`**
