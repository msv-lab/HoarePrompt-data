The values of `n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is split into two integers. The previous values of `n` and `t` are unknown, but they remain within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `t` are now assigned input values that are positive integers within their respective ranges.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000**
