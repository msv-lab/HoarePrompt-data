Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer. If `s_i` (from `bus_routes[i]`) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating no wait is needed. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring it remains non-negative. `min_wait_time` remains a non-negative integer, and `chosen_route` is set to `n + 1`, with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.***
