Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from all bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route that offers this minimum wait time (1-indexed). If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once, and `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. The output state accounts for all scenarios, ensuring that `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` reflect the minimum wait time encountered and the corresponding bus route index.**
