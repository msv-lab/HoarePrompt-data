The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. However, the value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `chosen_route`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state indicates that `chosen_route` is dependent on the unknown value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1` where `i` is unknown.**
