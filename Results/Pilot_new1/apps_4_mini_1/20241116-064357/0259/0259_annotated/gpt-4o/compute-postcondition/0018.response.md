The code assigns the values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]` to `s_i` and `d_i`. The variable `i` is currently equal to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `s_i` and `d_i` from the `bus_routes` list at index `n`. Since the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the contents of `bus_routes`, they cannot be determined without additional information. However, the state of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `wait_time`, and `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `i` is n, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[n]`**
