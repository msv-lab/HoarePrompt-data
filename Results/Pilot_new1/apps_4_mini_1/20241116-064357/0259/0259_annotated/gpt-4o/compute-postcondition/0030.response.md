The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, and `d_i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `wait_time` while the others remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is 0, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is set to `n + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]**
