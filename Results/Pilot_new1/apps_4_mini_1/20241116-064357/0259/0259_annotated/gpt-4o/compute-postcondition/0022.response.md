Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, indicating that there is no waiting time for the bus. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which accounts for the time until the next bus arrives based on the current time `t`, the start time `s_i`, and the interval `d_i`. This ensures that `wait_time` remains non-negative as per the definition of the problem.***
