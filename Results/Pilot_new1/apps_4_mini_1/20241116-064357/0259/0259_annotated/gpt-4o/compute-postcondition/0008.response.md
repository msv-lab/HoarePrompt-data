Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.**
