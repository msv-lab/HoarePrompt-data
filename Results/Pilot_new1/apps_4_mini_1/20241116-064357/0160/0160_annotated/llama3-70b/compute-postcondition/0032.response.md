The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. 

- `N` is an integer such that \(2 \leq N \leq 500\).
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq K \leq 10^9\).
- `A` is a list of integers where the length of the list is `N`, and each integer \(A[i]\) satisfies \(1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^6\).

The function processes these parameters and returns a specific output based on the logic defined within the function body. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and a list A of N integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6), and returns a result based on the input values.**
