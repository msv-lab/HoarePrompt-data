Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
