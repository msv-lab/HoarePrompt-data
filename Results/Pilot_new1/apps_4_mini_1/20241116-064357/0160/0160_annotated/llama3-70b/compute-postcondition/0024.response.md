According to the code, the loop executes for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration.

Given that `i` was calculated as `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the loop has already executed for values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, so to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`.

The loop's range is defined as `range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1)`, and since `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, it means the loop has reached its upper limit and cannot execute again.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `gcd`, which must be such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is increased, ensuring that `gcd` is modified to allow for a new value of `i`.

State: **`gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`**
