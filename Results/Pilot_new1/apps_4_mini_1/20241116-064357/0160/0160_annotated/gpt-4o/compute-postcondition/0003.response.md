The code adds the variable `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is known to be a divisor of `x` (as stated in the initial conditions), it will be included in the `divisors` set. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `i` has been added to the `divisors` set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` now includes `i`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is divisible by `i`.**
