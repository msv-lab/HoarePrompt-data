Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `x` is at least (int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1), and `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to `divisors`, and `x // i` is also added to `divisors`, ensuring that both `i` and its corresponding divisor `x // i` are included in the set of divisors.***
