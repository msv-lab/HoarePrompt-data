Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that includes `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i` (where `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1). If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged.***
