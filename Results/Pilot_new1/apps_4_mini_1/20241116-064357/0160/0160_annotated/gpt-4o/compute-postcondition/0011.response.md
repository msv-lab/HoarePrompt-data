The code adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. The previous value of `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which is at least `1` since `x` is at least `0`. The state of other variables (`N`, `K`, `A`) is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `x` is at least (int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1), `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, and `i` has been added to `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `x` is at least (int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1), `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, and `i` has been added to `divisors`.**
