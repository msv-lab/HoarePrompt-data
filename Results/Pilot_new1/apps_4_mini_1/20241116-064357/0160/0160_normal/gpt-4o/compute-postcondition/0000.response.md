The code initializes `divisors` as an empty set. Since this assignment does not depend on the values of the other variables (`N`, `K`, and `A`), they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `divisors` is now an empty set, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), and `divisors` is an empty set**.
