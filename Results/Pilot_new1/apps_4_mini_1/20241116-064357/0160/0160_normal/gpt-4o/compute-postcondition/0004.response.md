The variable `divisors` is updated by adding the result of `x // i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `x // i` is equal to `x // 1`, which is simply `x`. The previous values of the affected variables are `divisors`, which now includes the new value `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` now contains `x`, `x` is at least 1, and `i` is 1.
