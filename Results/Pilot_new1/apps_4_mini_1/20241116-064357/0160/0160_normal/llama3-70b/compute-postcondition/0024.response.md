According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to the upper limit of the range, which is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`. Since `gcd` is greater than 0, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1. 

To determine if the loop will execute again, we need to check if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Given `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `current_value + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now `current_value + 1` and also ensure that `i` does not exceed `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state:
- `i` should be updated to `current_value + 1`.
- `gcd` should be adjusted to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least `current_value + 1`.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(current_value + 1) ** 2`, `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`**
