The variable `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor of its current value and the value of `A[i]`. The initial value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `i` is 1, so `A[i]` corresponds to `A[1]`. The value of `gcd` will now be the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least `N` elements, `gcd` is updated to gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, and `i` is 1.
