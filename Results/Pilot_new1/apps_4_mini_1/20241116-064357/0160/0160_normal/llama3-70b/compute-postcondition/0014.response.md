The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `gcd` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1, the maximum value will remain `gcd` because `gcd` is greater than `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
