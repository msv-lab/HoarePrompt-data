Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than 0 and `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` can either remain unchanged or be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. This ensures that `max_divisor` is always the largest value between its previous state and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`, unless `i * i` equals `gcd`, in which case `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
