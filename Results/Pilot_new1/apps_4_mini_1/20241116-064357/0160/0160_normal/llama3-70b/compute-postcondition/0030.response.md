Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` found during the execution of the loop, which will be equal to `gcd` if `gcd` is greater than 0. If `gcd` is 0, the loop does not execute and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is negative, the loop does not execute, and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`. The loop executes for values of `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and updates `max_divisor` whenever `gcd` is divisible by `i` or `gcd // i`.**
