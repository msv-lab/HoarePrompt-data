The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. If the list contains only one element, it returns that element. If the list is empty, the function does not handle this case, which could lead to an IndexError when trying to access `lst[0]`. Therefore, the function should ideally include a check for an empty list to prevent this error.
