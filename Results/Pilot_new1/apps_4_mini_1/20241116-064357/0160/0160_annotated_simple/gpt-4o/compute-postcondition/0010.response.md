According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

Additionally, since `i` is now greater than `sqrt(x)`, `x` must be at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)^2)` to ensure that the divisor logic is correctly applied. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- Set `i` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.
- Ensure that `x` is at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1) ** 2)`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, `x` is at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1) ** 2)`**
