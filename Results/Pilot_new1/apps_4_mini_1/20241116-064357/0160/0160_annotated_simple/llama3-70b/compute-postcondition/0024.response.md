According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The loop will execute again if the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 1`, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is at least `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, it follows that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least `N - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `N`, which is greater than `N - 1`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be updated to `N`, which is the next value in the range.
- `gcd` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop condition.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is N**
