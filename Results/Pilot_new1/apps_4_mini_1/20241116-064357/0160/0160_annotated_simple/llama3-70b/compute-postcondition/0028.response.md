Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is N. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
