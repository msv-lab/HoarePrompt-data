Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the printed value corresponds to `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the printed value is the string representation of `s` in words, formatted as 'tens' followed by 'ones' if `s` is not a multiple of 10. Thus, all integers from 10 to 99 are correctly converted to their English word equivalents.***
