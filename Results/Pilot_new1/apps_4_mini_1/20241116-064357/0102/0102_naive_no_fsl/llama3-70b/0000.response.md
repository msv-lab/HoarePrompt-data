Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English words representation according to the specifications in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles different cases:

1. **Numbers 0-9**: The program uses the `ones` list to directly map integers (0-9) to their corresponding words. For example, input `6` correctly outputs `six`.

2. **Numbers 10-19**: The program uses the `teens` list to handle numbers in the range of 10-19. For example, input `15` correctly outputs `fifteen`.

3. **Numbers 20-99**: The program uses the `tens` list for the tens place and combines it with the `ones` list for the units place when necessary. For example, input `99` correctly outputs `ninety-nine`, and input `20` outputs `twenty`.

The program also correctly handles edge cases such as:
- Input `0` outputs an empty string since `ones[0]` is an empty string.
- Input `10` outputs `ten` correctly, as it falls within the `teens` range.

All potential cases for the input range (0 to 99) are covered, and the outputs match the expected results as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
