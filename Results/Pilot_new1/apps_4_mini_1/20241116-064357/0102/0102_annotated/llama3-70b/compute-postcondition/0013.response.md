The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates within the constraints that `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. However, there is no information provided about the output or the behavior of the function based on the value of `s`. Without any specific output details, it's not possible to define the functionality clearly. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the output behavior is not defined based on the provided information.**
