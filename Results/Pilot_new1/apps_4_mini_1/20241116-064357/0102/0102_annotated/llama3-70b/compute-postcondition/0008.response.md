The expression `teens[s - 10]` accesses an element from the `teens` list using the value of `s`, which is within the range of 10 to 19 inclusive. Therefore, `s - 10` will yield a value from 0 to 9. The `print` function outputs the corresponding element from the `teens` list based on that index. The state of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an integer within the range of 10 to 19 inclusive, and the function prints the value of `teens[s - 10]`**.
