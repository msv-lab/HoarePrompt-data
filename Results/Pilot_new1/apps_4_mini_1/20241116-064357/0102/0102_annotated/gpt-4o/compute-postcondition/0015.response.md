Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; if `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99, and if `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list corresponding to `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]'. For values of `n` less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not execute any return statement, thus leaving the handling of those cases undefined.***
