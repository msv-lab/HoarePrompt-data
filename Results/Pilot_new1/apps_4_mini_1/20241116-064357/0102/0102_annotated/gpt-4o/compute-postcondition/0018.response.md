The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99, and `s` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `s` in the format 'tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]'. For values of `s` less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value, leaving those cases undefined.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, and returns a string representation of the integer s based on its value, specifically from the ones, teens, or tens lists, or a combination of these, for valid values of s (0 to 99).**
