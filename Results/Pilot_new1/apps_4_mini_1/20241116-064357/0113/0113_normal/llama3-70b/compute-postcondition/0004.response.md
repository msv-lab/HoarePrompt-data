The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is in the range from 2 to \(10^9 + 1\), and since `n % x != 0`, it indicates that `n` is not divisible by \(x\). After the increment, `n` will be in the range from 3 to \(10^9 + 2\). The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is in the range 3 to \(10^9 + 2\), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is \(10^k\).

Output State: **`n` is in the range 3 to 10^9 + 2, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is 10^k**
