The function accepts no parameters and reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from input. It calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then finds the smallest multiple of `x` that is greater than or equal to `n` by incrementing `n` until `n % x` equals 0. Finally, it prints the resulting value of `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of `x`, it remains unchanged. The function does not handle invalid input cases or provide any return value; it only prints the result.
