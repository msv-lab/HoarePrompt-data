The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of two integers which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, so we can only describe their general state after the execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
