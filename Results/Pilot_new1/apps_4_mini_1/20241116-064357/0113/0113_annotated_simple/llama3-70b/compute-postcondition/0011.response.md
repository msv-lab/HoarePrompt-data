Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), which are read from input. It calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then increments `n` until it becomes a multiple of `x`, ensuring that the final value of `n` is at least the next multiple of `x` greater than or equal to the initial value of `n`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of `x`, it remains unchanged. **
