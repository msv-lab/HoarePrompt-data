Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` remains unchanged as it is either already a multiple of `x` or will be incremented to the next multiple of `x`. The value of `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8. The output will display the final value of `n`.**
