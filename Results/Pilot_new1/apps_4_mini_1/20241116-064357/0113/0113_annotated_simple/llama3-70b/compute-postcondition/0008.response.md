Output State: **`if n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n % x != 0, then n will be incremented until n % x == 0, resulting in n being at least the next multiple of x greater than or equal to the initial value of n. If n is already a multiple of x, the loop will not execute and the value of n will remain unchanged. k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and x is 10 raised to the power of k.`**
