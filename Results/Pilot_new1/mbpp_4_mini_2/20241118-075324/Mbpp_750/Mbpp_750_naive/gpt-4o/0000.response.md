Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it with the original list. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases, and there are no edge cases or potential issues that would cause the function to fail. The function correctly handles the addition of any tuple to a list, yielding the expected result in all cases. Therefore, the implementation meets the problem description's requirements.
