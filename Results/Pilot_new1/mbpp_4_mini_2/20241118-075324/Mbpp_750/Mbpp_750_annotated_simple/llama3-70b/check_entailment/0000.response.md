Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` is designed to take a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and it concatenates the two by converting the tuple into a list. The logic of the code is sound and correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

- The function takes two arguments: a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`.
- It converts the tuple into a list using `list(tup)`.
- It then concatenates the original list `lst` with the newly created list from the tuple using the `+` operator.
- Finally, it returns the concatenated result.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail in fulfilling the requirement of adding the tuple to the list. For example:

1. If `lst` is an empty list and `tup` is a non-empty tuple, it correctly returns the elements of the tuple as a list.
2. If both `lst` and `tup` are empty, it returns an empty list.
3. If `lst` contains elements and `tup` is empty, it returns the original list.
4. The function handles tuples of any length, including single-element tuples.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, I conclude that it is correct.
