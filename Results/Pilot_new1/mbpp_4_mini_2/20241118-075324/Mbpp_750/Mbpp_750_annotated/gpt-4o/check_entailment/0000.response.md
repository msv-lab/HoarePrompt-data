Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst, tpl)` correctly implements the requirement to add the given tuple `tpl` to the given list `lst`. The code concatenates `lst` with the elements of `tpl` converted to a list, which aligns with the problem description.

The annotations clarify that the function handles the case where `tpl` may be empty, returning the original list if `tpl` is empty. This is a valid behavior as per the problem description, which does not specify any restrictions or special cases for empty tuples.

Since the function works correctly for all potential cases, including the edge case of an empty tuple, I conclude that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct in every case.
