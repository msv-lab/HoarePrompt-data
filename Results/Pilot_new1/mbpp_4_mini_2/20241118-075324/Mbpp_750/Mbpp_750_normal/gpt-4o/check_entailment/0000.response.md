The function `func_1` is designed to concatenate a given list `lst` with a given tuple `tpl` by converting the tuple into a list. The implementation appears to correctly achieve this, as it uses the expression `lst + list(tpl)` to concatenate the two.

However, we need to consider edge cases that might not be handled by the function:

1. **Input Type Handling**: The function does not check if `lst` is indeed a list or if `tpl` is a tuple. If either of these assumptions is violated (for example, if `lst` is a string or `tpl` is a list), the function could raise a `TypeError` or produce unexpected results.

2. **Empty Inputs**: Although the function will handle empty lists or tuples correctly (i.e., `func_1([], ())` would return `[]`), it is important to ensure that this behavior is explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Considering the output hints, they state that the function assumes valid inputs (a list and a tuple) but does not handle cases where these assumptions are violated. This aligns with the potential issue identified above, indicating that the function may not behave correctly with invalid inputs.

Thus, while the function behaves correctly for valid inputs as described in the problem, it fails to account for scenarios where the input types are incorrect, which is a critical aspect of robustness in programming.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not handle cases where `lst` is not a list or `tpl` is not a tuple, which violates the requirement to follow the problem description for all potential cases.
