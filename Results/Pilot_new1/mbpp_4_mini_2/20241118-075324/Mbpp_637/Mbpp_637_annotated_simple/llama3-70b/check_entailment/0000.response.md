Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether there is no profit and no loss based on the cost price and selling price. The function `func_1` returns `True` if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`, indicating that the transaction results in neither profit nor loss. If they are not equal, it returns `False`, which is also correct as it indicates a profit or a loss.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly based on the problem description. The logic is straightforward and accurately captures the requirement that the two prices must be equal for there to be no profit and no loss. 

Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases.
