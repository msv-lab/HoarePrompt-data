Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. The function `func_1` returns `True` if there is no profit and no loss, which is precisely what the problem description requires. 

The annotation correctly describes the functionality of the code, stating that it returns a boolean value indicating whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. 

Since the function accurately implements the requirement of the problem description for all potential cases (i.e., it will return `True` only when there is neither profit nor loss), there are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the specifications.

Thus, the program is correct.
