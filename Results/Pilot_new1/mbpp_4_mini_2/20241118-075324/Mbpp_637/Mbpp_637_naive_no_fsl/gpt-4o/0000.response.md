Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to determine if there is "no profit and no loss," which is accurately represented by the equality check.

The assertions provided in the program:
- `func_1(1500, 1200) == False` correctly indicates that there is a loss (since the selling price is less than the cost price).
- `func_1(100, 100) == True` correctly indicates that there is no profit and no loss (since the selling price equals the cost price).
- `func_1(2000, 5000) == False` correctly indicates that there is a profit (since the selling price is greater than the cost price).

The function handles all cases correctly as per the problem description, and no potential edge cases are overlooked. Thus, the function behaves as expected for all tested scenarios.
