Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. If they are equal, it indicates there is no profit and no loss, returning `True`. If they are not equal, it returns `False`, indicating either a profit or a loss. The provided assertions validate this logic with different scenarios, and all cases return the expected results. Since there are no edge cases or potential inputs that would lead to incorrect results, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
