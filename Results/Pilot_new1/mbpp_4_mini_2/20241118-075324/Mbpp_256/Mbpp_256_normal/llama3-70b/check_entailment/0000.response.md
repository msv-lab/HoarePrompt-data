The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `is_prime`. 

1. **Function `func_1(n: int) -> int`:** This function counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative integer `n`. 
   - If `n` is less than 2, it correctly returns 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
   - If `n` is exactly 2, it also correctly returns 0 as there are no prime numbers less than 2.
   - For values of `n` greater than 2, it iterates from 2 to `n-1`, counting how many of those numbers are prime by calling `is_prime`.

2. **Function `is_prime(num: int) -> bool`:** This function checks if a given integer `num` is prime.
   - It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2, which includes 0 and 1.
   - For numbers 2 and greater, it checks for divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If it finds a divisor, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program seems to handle edge cases for `n < 2` and `n = 2` correctly.
- However, the problem description specifies that the function should take a non-negative number. The `is_prime` function does not handle negative integers, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such values are passed. However, since `func_1` does not allow negative numbers (as it only counts primes less than `n`), this issue may not directly affect the output of `func_1`.

### Output Hints:
The output hints for both functions seem to agree with the code:
- For `func_1`, it correctly states that the function will return 0 for `n < 2` and `n = 2`.
- For `is_prime`, the hints accurately describe the behavior of the function regarding prime checking.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative integer `n` according to the problem description. The only potential issue arises from the handling of negative integers, which the problem description does not explicitly mention should be accounted for, but since the input is assumed to be non-negative, this is likely not a concern.

Correctness: **True**.
