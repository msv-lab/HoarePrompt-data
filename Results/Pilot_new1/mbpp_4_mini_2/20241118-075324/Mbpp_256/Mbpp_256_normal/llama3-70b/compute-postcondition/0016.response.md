The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. If `num` is 0 or 1, it also returns `False`. If `num` is 2 or greater, the function evaluates whether `num` is divisible by any integer `i` starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the function completes without returning during the loop and subsequently returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, returns False if num is less than 2 (including 0 and 1). If num is 2 or greater and is not divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of num, it returns True, indicating that num is a prime number; otherwise, it returns False.**
