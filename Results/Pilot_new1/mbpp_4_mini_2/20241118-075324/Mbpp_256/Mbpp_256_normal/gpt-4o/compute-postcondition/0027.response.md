According to the code, the loop will execute if the starting value of `j` (which is `i * i`) is less than `n`. In this case, `i` is 4, so `i * i` equals 16. Since `n` is greater than 9, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 17 for the loop to execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be the last value calculated in the loop, which will be less than `n`. The initial value of `j` will be 16.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be confirmed:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 17 (to ensure the loop can start).
- `i` is 4.
- `j` starts at 16.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 17, `i` is 4, `j` is 16**
