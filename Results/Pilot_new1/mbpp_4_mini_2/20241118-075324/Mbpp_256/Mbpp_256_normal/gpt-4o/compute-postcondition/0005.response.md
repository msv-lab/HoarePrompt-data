According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, because if `n` is less than 2, the range will not include any values, and the loop will not run. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be at the value of `int(n ** 0.5)`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` should start at 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
