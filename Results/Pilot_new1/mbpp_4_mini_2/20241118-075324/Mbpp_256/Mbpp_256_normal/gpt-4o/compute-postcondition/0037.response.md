Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` will have all non-prime indices up to `n` marked as False for every prime `i` found between 2 and the square root of `n`. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is exactly 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to 3, the loop will execute only once for `i = 2`, marking multiples of 2 as not prime. If `n` is less than 4, the inner loop will not execute.**
