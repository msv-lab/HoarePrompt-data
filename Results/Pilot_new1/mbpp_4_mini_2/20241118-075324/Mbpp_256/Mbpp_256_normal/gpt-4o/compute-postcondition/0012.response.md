The value of `j` is 8, and the assignment `is_prime[j] = False` sets `is_prime[8]` to False. The previous states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 8, `is_prime[4]` is now False, `is_prime[6]` is now False, and `is_prime[8]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 8, `is_prime[4]` is now False, `is_prime[6]` is now False, and `is_prime[8]` is now False**
