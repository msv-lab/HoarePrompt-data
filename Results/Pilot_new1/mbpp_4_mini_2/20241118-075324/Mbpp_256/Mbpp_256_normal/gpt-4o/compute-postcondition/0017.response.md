According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `n` and `i`. The loop will execute if the starting point `i * i` is less than `n`. 

Given that `i` is 3, `i * i` equals 9. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 9, we need to ensure that `n` is strictly greater than 9 for the loop to execute at least once (as the range function will not include the endpoint). 

Thus, before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states to reflect that `n` must be greater than 9, and we also need to set `j` to the starting point of the loop, which is `i * i` or 9.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
