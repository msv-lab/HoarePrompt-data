The code assigns the value `False` to `is_prime[j]`. Since `j` is 20, this means `is_prime[20]` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `is_prime[16]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 20, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime[16]` is set to False, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False**
