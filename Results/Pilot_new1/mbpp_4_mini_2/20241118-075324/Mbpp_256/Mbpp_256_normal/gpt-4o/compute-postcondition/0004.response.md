The code assigns `False` to the first two elements of the `is_prime` list, which correspond to the indices 0 and 1. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the list `is_prime` is initialized with a length of `n`, and its values are all set to `True`. The assignment affects only the first two elements of the list. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` has `False` at indices 0 and 1, and `True` elsewhere (if `n` > 2).

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` has `False` at indices 0 and 1, and `True` elsewhere (if `n` > 2)**
