The code assigns the value `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 15. The previous state indicates that `is_prime[9]` is `False` and `is_prime[12]` is `False`, but there is no prior value specified for `is_prime[15]`. Therefore, the output state is affected only by the assignment to `is_prime[15]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, and `is_prime[15]` is set to False**
