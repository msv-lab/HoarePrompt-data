To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` and see if it correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If so, it returns 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Prime Number Sieve**: The function initializes a list `is_prime` of size `n`, where `is_prime[i]` will be `True` if `i` is a prime number and `False` otherwise. It correctly marks 0 and 1 as non-prime.

3. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: The function implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers. It iterates through potential prime numbers starting from 2 and marks their multiples as non-prime. This part of the code is correct.

4. **Counting Primes**: Finally, the function sums the `True` values in the `is_prime` list to count the number of primes less than `n`.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For `n = 0`, the function should return 0 (no primes less than 0).
- For `n = 1`, the function should return 0 (no primes less than 1).
- For `n = 2`, the function should return 0 (no primes less than 2).
- For `n = 3`, the function should return 1 (only the prime number 2 is less than 3).
- For larger numbers, the function appears to work correctly based on the assertions provided.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem description, returning the correct count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

Correctness: **True**
