According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `num` is 2 or greater. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the upper limit of the range, which is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. If `num` is 2, `int(num ** 0.5)` equals 1, thus the upper limit becomes 2. Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will not execute again because the range will be `range(2, 2)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be greater than 2 so that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` becomes greater than 2. Therefore, `num` must be greater than 2, and `i` should be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`num` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
