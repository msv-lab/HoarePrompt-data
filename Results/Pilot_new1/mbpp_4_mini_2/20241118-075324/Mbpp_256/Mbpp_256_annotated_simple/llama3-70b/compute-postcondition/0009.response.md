Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than 2 and `i` is 3. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by `i`, the function does not return any value, implying further checks may be required to determine the primality of `num`.***
