According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `num` is greater than or equal to 17. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `i` is still less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `num` is at least 17, we calculate `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`:

- For `num = 17`, `int(17 ** 0.5) + 1` equals `5`.
- For larger values of `num`, this value will only increase.

Since `i` is currently 4, the loop can execute again, as 4 is less than 5. 

However, for the next iteration, `i` will increment by 1, so it will become 5. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `num` remains greater than or equal to 17.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 17, `i` is 5**
