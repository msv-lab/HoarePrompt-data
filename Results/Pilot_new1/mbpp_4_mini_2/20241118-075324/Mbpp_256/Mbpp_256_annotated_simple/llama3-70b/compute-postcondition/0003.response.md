According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2, as the range function needs a start value of 2. 

If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop will execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need the following states:
- `num` must be 2 or greater.
- `i` should start at 2.

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
