To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
We need to write a function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2):
        return 0
        # The program returns 0
    # State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return any value.
    
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False. For each `i` from 2 up to `int(n`
    
    return sum(is_prime)
    # The program returns the sum of the boolean values in the list 'is_prime', which counts the number of True values, representing the prime numbers in the range from 2 to n-1.
```

### Key Points:
1. **Handling of `n <= 2`:** The program correctly returns 0 for any non-negative integer input less than or equal to 2, which aligns with the requirement since there are no prime numbers less than 2.
  
2. **Prime Number Sieve:** The code initializes a list `is_prime` where indices represent numbers, and boolean values indicate whether the index is a prime. It correctly marks non-prime indices using the Sieve of Eratosthenes method.

3. **Counting Primes:** The final step sums the boolean values in the `is_prime` list, which correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n = 0`: The function returns 0, which is correct as there are no primes less than 0.
- When `n = 1`: The function again returns 0, which is correct as there are no primes less than 1.
- When `n = 2`: The function returns 0, which is correct as there are no primes less than 2.
- When `n = 3`: The function should return 1 (only the prime number 2 is less than 3), and it does so correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem description. There are no potential cases where it fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
