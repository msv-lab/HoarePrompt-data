According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 20, and `n` is greater than 20. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value in the sequence generated by `range(i * i, n, i)`. Since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `20 + 4 = 24`.

Now, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Given that `n` is greater than 20, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 25 for the loop to run with `j` being 24.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be updated to 24.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 24.

State: **`n` is greater than 24, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[16]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False**
