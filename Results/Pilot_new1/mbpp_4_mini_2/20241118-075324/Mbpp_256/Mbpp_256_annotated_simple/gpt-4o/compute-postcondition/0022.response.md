The line of code `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. The value of `j` is 15, so `is_prime[15]` is set to `False`. Since `is_prime[12]` is already `False`, this does not change its state. The values of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 12, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 15**
