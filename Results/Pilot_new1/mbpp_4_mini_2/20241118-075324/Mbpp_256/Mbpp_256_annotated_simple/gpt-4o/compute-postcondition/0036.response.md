According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the condition `i <= int(n ** 0.5)`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to the integer value of the square root of `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is at least 9, which means `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 3.
- The loop variable `i` will start at 2 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. If `i` reached `int(n ** 0.5)` during the last iteration, then `i` would need to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Thus, if `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 3, which means `i` could be at most 3 at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, it is necessary to set `i` to 3 and ensure that `n` is still at least 9.

No other states need to be adjusted since the conditions regarding `is_prime` do not affect the loop execution directly.

State: **`n` is at least 9, `i` is 3**
