According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, as the starting point of the range is 2. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 2.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 2.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 2**
