The loop is designed to mark multiples of `i` (which is 4) in the `is_prime` list as `False`, starting from `i * i` (16) and continuing up to `n`, incrementing by `i` each time. 

The loop will execute as long as `j` (the current multiple of `i`) is less than `n`. The first iteration begins at `j = 16`, and subsequent iterations will mark `is_prime[20]`, `is_prime[24]`, and so forth, as `False`.

If `n` is less than or equal to 16, the loop will not execute at all, and the `is_prime` list will remain unchanged except for the initial values.

Output State: **If `n` is greater than 16, `is_prime` will have `is_prime[16]`, `is_prime[20]`, `is_prime[24]`, etc., set to `False` for each multiple of 4 less than `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 16, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False.**
