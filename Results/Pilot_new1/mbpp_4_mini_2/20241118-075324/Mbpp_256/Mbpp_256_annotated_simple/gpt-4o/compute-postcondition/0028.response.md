The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned the value `False`. Given that `j` is 16, this means that `is_prime[16]` is set to `False`. The other variables `n`, `is_prime`, `i`, and the previous value of `is_prime[16]` (which is not specified but could be either True or False) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 17, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, and `is_prime[16]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is at least 17, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, and `is_prime[16]` is set to False**
