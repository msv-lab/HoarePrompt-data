Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all indices `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` (exclusive) in increments of `i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False, indicating that these indices are not prime numbers. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop does not execute, and the values of `is_prime` remain unchanged except for those already set to False. All even indices greater than 2 will also be set to False, indicating they are not prime.***
