Output State: **`is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False. For each `i` from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5)`, if `is_prime[i]` is True, all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n` (exclusive) are set to False in `is_prime`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False. If `n` is 2 or 3, the loop executes 0 times, and `is_prime` remains unchanged except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, all even indices greater than 2 will also be set to False, indicating they are not prime.**
