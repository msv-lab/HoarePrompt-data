According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value in the range, which is `j + i`. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the provided state, we can only assume that `i` is a positive integer. Therefore, `j` will need to be adjusted to `j + i`.

However, we know `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j` for the loop to continue executing. Thus, if we set `j` to `j + i`, we also need to ensure that `n` remains greater than this new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than `j + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `j` is `4 + i`**
