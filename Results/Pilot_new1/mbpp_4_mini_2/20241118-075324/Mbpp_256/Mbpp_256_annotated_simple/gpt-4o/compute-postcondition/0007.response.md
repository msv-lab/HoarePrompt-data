According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the variable `n`. The loop will execute if the starting value for `j`, which is `i * i`, is less than `n`. Given that `i` is currently 2, `i * i` equals 4. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 4.

At the start of the loop, `j` will be initialized to `i * i`, which is 4, and the loop will iterate with increments of `i`, which is 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the conditions must be:
1. `n` must be greater than 4.
2. `j` is initialized to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[i]` is True for `i` equal to 2, `j` is 4**
