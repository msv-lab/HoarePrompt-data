The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to False, where `j` is 12. This means that the element at index 12 in the `is_prime` list is now False. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 12, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `is_prime[12]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is at least 12, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `is_prime[12]` is now False**.
