The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 20. Since `is_prime[20]` was not specified to be anything other than its previous value, it will now be set to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 20, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[16]` as False, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 20, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[16]` is False, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False**.
