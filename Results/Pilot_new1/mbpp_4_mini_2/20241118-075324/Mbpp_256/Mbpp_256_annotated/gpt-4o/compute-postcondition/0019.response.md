According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for a specific index `j`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `j` for the next iteration. Since the loop starts at `i * i` and increments `j` by `i` each time, we need to set `j` to `j + i` for the next iteration.

Additionally, we must ensure that `j` remains less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, if `j` was the last value in the previous iteration, the new state must reflect:
- `j` should be updated to `j + i`.
- `is_prime[j]` remains False at the new index `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j`, `j` is less than n, and `i` is less than sqrt(n)**
