The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 6. The initial state indicates that `is_prime[6]` is currently `True` because `is_prime[i]` is `True` for all `i` from `5` to `n-1`. Therefore, after the assignment, `is_prime[6]` will change to `False`. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[3]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[5]` is True, `is_prime[6]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `7` to `n-1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
