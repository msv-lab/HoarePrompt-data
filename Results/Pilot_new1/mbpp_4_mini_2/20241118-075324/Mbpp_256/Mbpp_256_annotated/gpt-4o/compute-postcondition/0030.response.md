The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`, where `j` is calculated as `i * i + i`. The initial state indicates that `is_prime[i]` is `True` for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, and since `j` is less than `n`, this operation will mark a composite number as not prime in the `is_prime` list.

The specific value of `j` will depend on the current value of `i`, but since `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`, it will always be within the bounds of the `is_prime` array.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `is_prime[j]` is set to False for the calculated value of `j`, which is `i * i + i`, affecting the primality of the number represented by `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2; `is_prime[j]` is set to False for `j = i * i + i`.**
