The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. The previous value of `j` is determined by the expression `i * i + i`, but since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify the exact value of `j`. However, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and thus `j` will be a non-negative integer based on the value of `i`. The state of `n` remains unchanged, and the variable `is_prime[j]` is updated. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
