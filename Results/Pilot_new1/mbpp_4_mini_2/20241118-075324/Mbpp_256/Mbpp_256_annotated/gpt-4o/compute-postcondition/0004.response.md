The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`. Since `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, the values at indices `0` and `1` will change from `True` to `False`. The other elements of `is_prime` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime` has `False` at indices `0` and `1`, and `True` for all other indices from `2` to `n-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`**
