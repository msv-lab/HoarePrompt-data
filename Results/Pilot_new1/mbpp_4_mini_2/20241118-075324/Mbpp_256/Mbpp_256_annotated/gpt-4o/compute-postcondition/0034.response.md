Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, where `j` takes values in the form of `i * i + k * i` for `k` being a non-negative integer. If `i` is greater than or equal to sqrt(n), the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices `j` in the range. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
