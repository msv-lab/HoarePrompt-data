Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than 2. According to the problem description, the function should return the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. However, if `n` is 0 or 1, the function `func_1` does not explicitly account for these cases, which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

For example:
- If `n` is 0, the expected output should be 0 (since there are no prime numbers less than 0), but the program will return 0 without any explicit handling, which is acceptable.
- If `n` is 1, the expected output should also be 0 (since there are no prime numbers less than 1), but again, the program will return 0 without any explicit handling.

However, the lack of explicit handling for these edge cases in the code could lead to confusion or incorrect assumptions about its behavior, especially since the annotations suggest that the function does not consider cases where `n` is less than 2. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
