According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. The loop starts with `i` being initialized to 2 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, since `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, we need to consider the value of `int(num ** 0.5)`. The smallest value for `num` is 16, which gives `int(num ** 0.5)` as 4. 

If `i` is currently at 4, the loop will not execute again because the next value of `i` would be 5, which is greater than `int(num ** 0.5)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we can keep `num` the same (as long as it remains greater than or equal to 16) and adjust `i` to be 4, which means `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least 4, which is satisfied if `num` is at least 16.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to be 4 and ensuring that `num` is such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4. 

State: **`num` is an integer greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
