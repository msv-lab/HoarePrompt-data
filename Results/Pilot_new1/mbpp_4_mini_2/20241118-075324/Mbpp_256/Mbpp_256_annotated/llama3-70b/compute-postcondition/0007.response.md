According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit of the loop, which is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `num` is an integer that is 2 or greater, we need to check if `i` is still less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` for the loop to execute again. 

If `num` is 2, then `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will be 2, meaning `i` cannot be less than this value for the loop to execute again. However, if `num` is greater than 2, `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` will be greater than 2, allowing the loop to continue.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the value of `i` to 3 (the next integer) and confirm that `num` is greater than 2, so that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is also greater than 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states should be:
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3**
