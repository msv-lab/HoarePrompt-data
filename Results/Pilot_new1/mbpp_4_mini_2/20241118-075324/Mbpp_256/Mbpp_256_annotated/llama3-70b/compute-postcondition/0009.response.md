Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer greater than 2 and `i` is 3. If `num` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `num % i == 0`), the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by `i`, the function does not return anything, and the state of the program remains unchanged.***
