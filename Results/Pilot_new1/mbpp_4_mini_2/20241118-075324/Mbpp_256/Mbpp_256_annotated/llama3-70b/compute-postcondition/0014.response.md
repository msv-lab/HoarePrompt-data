Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop checks for divisibility of `num` by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, the loop completes without returning, and the function implicitly returns None. Therefore, after the loop, if it executes, `i` will be the last integer checked, which is `int(num ** 0.5)`, and `num` remains unchanged. If `num` is exactly 2, the loop does not execute and `i` is undefined.**
