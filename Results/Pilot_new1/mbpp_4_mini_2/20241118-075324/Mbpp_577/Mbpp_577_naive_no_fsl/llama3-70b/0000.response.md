Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the last digit of the factorial for all potential cases. 

For example:
- When `n = 5`, the factorial is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program returns `0` correctly for `n >= 5`, but it does not handle the correct output for `n = 1`, `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4` correctly. Specifically:
  - For `n = 1`, it returns `1` (which is correct).
  - For `n = 2`, it returns `2` (which is correct).
  - For `n = 3`, it returns `3` (which is correct).
  - For `n = 4`, it returns `4` (which is correct).
  - However, for `n = 5` and higher, it returns `0`, which is not the last digit of the factorial but rather a hardcoded response.

The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly for `n >= 5`, where the last digit of the factorial is always `0`. Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not compute the last digit of the factorial correctly for all inputs.
