Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` (which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`), and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`).***
