The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the following: if `n` is less than 2, it returns `n`; if `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `n`; if `n` is equal to 4, it returns 4; for all other values of `n` that are greater than 4, it returns 0. The function does not handle negative integers or values of `n` less than 0, as it assumes `n` is non-negative.
