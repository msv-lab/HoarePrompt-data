The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `n`. If `n` is 2 or 3, the function returns `n` itself. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other values of `n` that are greater than or equal to 2 but not equal to 2, 3, or 4, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on the conditions outlined above.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns n if n is less than 2, returns n if n is 2 or 3, returns 4 if n is equal to 4, and returns 0 for all other non-negative integers greater than or equal to 2 that are not equal to 2, 3, or 4.**
