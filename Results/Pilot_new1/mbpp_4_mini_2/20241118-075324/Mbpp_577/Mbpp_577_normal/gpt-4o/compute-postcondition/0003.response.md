The variable `factorial` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and since `n` is a non-negative integer less than 5, it does not affect the assignment of `factorial`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer less than 5, and `factorial` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 5, and `factorial` is 1**
