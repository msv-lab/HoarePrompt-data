Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function computes the factorial of `n`, which is a product of all positive integers up to `n`, and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). This covers the cases where `n` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, with the respective calculations resulting in 1, 1, 2, 6, and 4 for the last digit.***
