The variable `factorial` is initialized to 1. The value of `n` remains unaffected by this assignment. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5, the output state reflects the initialization of `factorial` and the condition of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and less than 5; `factorial` is 1**
