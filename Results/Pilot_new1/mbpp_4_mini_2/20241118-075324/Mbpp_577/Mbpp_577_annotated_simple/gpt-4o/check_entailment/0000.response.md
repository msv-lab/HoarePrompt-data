To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n >= 5):
        return 0
    else:
        factorial = 1
        # Calculate the factorial for n < 5
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial % 10  # Return the last digit of the factorial
```

### Problem Description:
The problem asks for a function to find the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n`.

### Annotated Comments:
1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns `0`.
2. If `n` is less than `5`, the function computes the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit.

### Correctness Check:
1. **For `n >= 5`:**
   - The function correctly returns `0` because the last digit of any factorial for `n >= 5` is `0` (as factorials of 5 and above include the factors 2 and 5, which multiply to give a trailing zero).

2. **For `n < 5`:**
   - The program computes the factorial correctly and returns the last digit:
     - `n = 0`: `0! = 1`, last digit is `1`.
     - `n = 1`: `1! = 1`, last digit is `1`.
     - `n = 2`: `2! = 2`, last digit is `2`.
     - `n = 3`: `3! = 6`, last digit is `6`.
     - `n = 4`: `4! = 24`, last digit is `4`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases according to the problem description. There are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements provided in the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

### Explanation:
The function correctly identifies that for any input `n >= 5`, the last digit of the factorial is `0` and accurately computes the last digit of the factorial for inputs `n < 5`, returning the expected results for all specified cases.
