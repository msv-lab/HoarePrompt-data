The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, it computes the factorial of `n` but does not actually return the last digit of that factorial, as the code is incomplete. The expected behavior is to return the last digit of the factorial, which would be 1 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, 2 for `n = 2`, 6 for `n = 3`, and 4 for `n = 4`. However, since the return statement for the last digit is missing, the function currently does not fulfill its intended purpose for `n < 5`.
