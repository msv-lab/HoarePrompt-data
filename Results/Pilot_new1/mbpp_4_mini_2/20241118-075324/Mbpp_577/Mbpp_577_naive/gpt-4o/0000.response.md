Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly handle the case when `n` is equal to 0 or 1. According to the problem description, the function should find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. The factorial of 0 is 1, and the last digit of 1 is 1. However, the program does not return the correct result for these cases:

- `func_1(0)` should return 1, but the program does not handle this case at all.
- `func_1(1)` should also return 1, but similarly, it is not explicitly managed.

Thus, for inputs `0` and `1`, the function does not return the expected last digit of the factorial. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
