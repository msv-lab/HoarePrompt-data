Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. For example, consider the input `n = 5`. The factorial of 5 is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program would return `0` for any `n >= 5`, which is incorrect. 

Additionally, for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the factorial is `1`, and the last digit should also be `1`, but the program returns `0` for these cases as well. Thus, there are multiple inputs where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description.
