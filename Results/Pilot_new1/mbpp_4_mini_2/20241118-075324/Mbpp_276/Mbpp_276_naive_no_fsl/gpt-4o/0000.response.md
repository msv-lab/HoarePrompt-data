Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the radius or height of the cylinder is negative. According to the mathematical definition of a cylinder's volume, both the radius and height should be non-negative. 

For example, if we call `func_1(-1, 5)`, the program will still compute a volume, resulting in a negative value, which is not a valid physical scenario for the volume of a cylinder. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.
