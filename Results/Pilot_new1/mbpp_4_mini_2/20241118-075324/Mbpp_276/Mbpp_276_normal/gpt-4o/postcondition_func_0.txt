The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be positive real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula π * radius² * height. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are non-positive values, which would lead to an incorrect volume calculation.
