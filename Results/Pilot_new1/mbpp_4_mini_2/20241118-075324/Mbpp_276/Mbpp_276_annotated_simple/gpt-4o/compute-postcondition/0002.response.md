The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the calculated volume based on the formula involving `math.pi` and `radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume based on the provided radius. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `radius` and `height`, both non-negative real numbers, and returns the calculated volume based on the formula involving `radius`.**
