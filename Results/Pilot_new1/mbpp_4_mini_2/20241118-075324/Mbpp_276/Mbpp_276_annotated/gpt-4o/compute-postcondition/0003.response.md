Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula \( \text{volume} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). However, the annotations incorrectly state that the function returns the volume calculated as \( \pi \times \text{radius} \), which is not accurate. The function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, but it will return a valid volume for non-negative inputs. **
