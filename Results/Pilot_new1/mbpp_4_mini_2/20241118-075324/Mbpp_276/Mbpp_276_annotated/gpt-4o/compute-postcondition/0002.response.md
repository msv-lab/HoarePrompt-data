The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the volume based on the formula involving `radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume calculated using the provided formula. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume calculated as math.pi * radius.**
