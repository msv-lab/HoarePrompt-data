Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the loop will execute for each character in `s`. If all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`, the function completes without returning a value (implicitly returns None). If any character in `s` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. If `s` is empty, an IndexError occurs, and the loop does not execute.**
