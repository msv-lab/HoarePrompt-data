Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, then the loop checks if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`. If all characters are equal, the loop completes without returning anything. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns True.**
