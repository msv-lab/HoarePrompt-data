According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will continue to iterate over its characters. At the end of the last iteration, we know that the third character `char` is equal to the first character `first_char`, which means the loop has not returned a value and continues.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of `char` to be the next character in the string `s`. If `char` was the third character in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `char` should be the fourth character, and the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `s`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `char` is updated to the next character and that the loop can continue.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the fourth character in `s`, `first_char` is the first character in `s`**
