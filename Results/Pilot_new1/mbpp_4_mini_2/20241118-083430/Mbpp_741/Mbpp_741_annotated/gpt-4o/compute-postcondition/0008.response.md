According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`. This means that the loop has processed the first character of `s`, and for it to execute one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string. 

Since `char` is equal to `first_char` at the end of the last iteration, and we know that `s` is non-empty, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` is now the second character of `s`, and `first_char` remains the same (as it is still the first character of `s`).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
