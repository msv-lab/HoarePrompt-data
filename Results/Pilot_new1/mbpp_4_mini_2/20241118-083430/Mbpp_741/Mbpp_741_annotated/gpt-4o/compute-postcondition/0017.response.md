The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string that may be empty or contain any characters. 

If `s` is empty, the function returns `True`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the function checks whether all characters in `s` are equal to the first character of `s`. If all characters are equal, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns `None`). If any character is not equal to the first character, the function returns `False`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return `True` if `s` is empty, return `False` if not all characters in `s` are equal to the first character, and return nothing (implicitly `None`) if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, returns `True` if `s` is empty, returns `False` if not all characters in `s` are equal to the first character, and returns nothing if all characters in `s` are equal to the first character.**
