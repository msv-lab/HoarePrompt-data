Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input `s` is `None`. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all characters in a string are the same. However, if `s` is `None`, the code will raise an error when it tries to access `s[0]`. 

The annotations indicate that if `s` is empty, the function correctly returns `True`, which is acceptable. However, they also state that the function does not handle the case of `s` being `None`, which could lead to an error when trying to access `s[0]`. This is a critical oversight because the function is expected to handle all possible cases of input, including `None`.

Thus, since the program fails to handle the `None` case and could potentially raise an error, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
