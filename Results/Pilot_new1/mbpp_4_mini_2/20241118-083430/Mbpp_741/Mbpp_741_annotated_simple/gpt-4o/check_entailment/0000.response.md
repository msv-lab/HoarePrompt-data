To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code in relation to the problem description, which states that we need to check whether all characters in the string are the same.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

### Understanding the Logic
1. **Empty String Check**: 
   - The code checks if the string `s` is empty. If it is, it returns `True`. This is a logical choice because an empty string can be considered to have all "same" characters (since there are no characters to compare).

2. **First Character Comparison**:
   - If the string is not empty, it assigns the first character of the string to `first_char`.
   - It then iterates through each character in the string. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, it returns `False`.

3. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any differing character, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases
- **Empty String**: The function correctly returns `True`.
- **Single Character String**: For example, `func_1("a")` should return `True`, which it does.
- **Multiple Same Characters**: For example, `func_1("aaaa")` should return `True`, which it does.
- **Different Characters**: For example, `func_1("abc")` should return `False`, which it does.

### Potential Issue
However, let's consider a case where the string contains a mix of characters, specifically:
- For example, the string `func_1("aaab")` should return `False` as not all characters are the same. The function correctly identifies this and returns `False`.

### Conclusion
The code appears to handle all relevant cases correctly:
- It returns `True` for an empty string.
- It returns `True` for strings with the same character.
- It returns `False` for strings with at least one differing character.

Since I cannot find any input or potential case where the program does not meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
