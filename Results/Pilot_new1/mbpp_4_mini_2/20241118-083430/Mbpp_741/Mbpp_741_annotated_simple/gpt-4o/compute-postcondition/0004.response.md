According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must contain at least one character. Additionally, if `s` has characters, we need to ensure that `first_char` is assigned the first character of `s`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `s` is not empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and that we start iterating with `char` being the first character.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
