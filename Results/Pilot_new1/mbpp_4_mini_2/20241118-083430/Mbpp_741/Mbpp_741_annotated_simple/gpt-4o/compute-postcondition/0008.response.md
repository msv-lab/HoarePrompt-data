According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string and `first_char` is the first character of `s`, we need to consider the current character `char` and its relation to `first_char`.

At the end of the last iteration, `char` must be equal to `first_char` for the function to continue executing without returning. If `char` is equal to `first_char`, the loop can execute again for the next character in `s`. 

To execute one more iteration of the loop, `char` should be updated to the next character in the string `s`. Thus, if `char` is currently the first character (the first iteration), it will move to the second character in the next iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `first_char` remains the same (as it is the first character of `s`).
- `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string, which would be the second character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
