The variable `odd_pairs` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The previous value of `odd_count` is used for this calculation, but since the specific value is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `odd_pairs`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`**.
