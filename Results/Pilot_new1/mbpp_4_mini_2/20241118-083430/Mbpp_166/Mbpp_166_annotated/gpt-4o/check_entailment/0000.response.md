To determine the correctness of the provided Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze both the code and its annotations.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. 

### Code Analysis
The provided function `func_1(lst)` does the following:
1. Counts the number of even integers in the list (`even_count`).
2. Counts the number of odd integers in the list (`odd_count`).
3. Computes the number of ways to choose 2 even integers using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
4. Computes the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers using the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
5. Returns the sum of these two results.

### Annotations
The annotations state that the function returns the sum of the number of ways to choose 2 even integers and the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from the list. It also mentions that if the list is empty or contains fewer than two integers, the function will return 0.

### Key Points to Consider
1. **XOR and Evenness**: A pair of integers XORs to an even number if both integers are even or both integers are odd. 
   - The function correctly counts pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers, which aligns with the requirement to count pairs that XOR to an even number.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function handles empty lists and lists with fewer than two integers by returning 0, which is correct since no pairs can be formed.

3. **Correctness of Count Calculation**: The formulas used for counting pairs of even and odd integers are mathematically correct.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It counts the number of pairs of integers that XOR to an even number by counting the even and odd integers separately and using combinatorial counting to find the pairs.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The code is correct because it accurately counts the pairs of integers that XOR to an even number in accordance with the problem description.
