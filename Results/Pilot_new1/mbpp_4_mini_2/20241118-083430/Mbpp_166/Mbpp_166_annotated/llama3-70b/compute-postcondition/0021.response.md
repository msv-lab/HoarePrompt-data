Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both integers have the same parity, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the parity is different, `count` remains unchanged. The condition also ensures that the length of `nums` is greater than `i + 2` and `j` is `i + 2`.***
