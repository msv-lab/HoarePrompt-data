Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If the integers at indices `i` (2) and `j` (5) in the list `nums` have the same parity, then `count` is incremented by 1. Note that `len(nums)` is greater than 5, ensuring that both indices are valid.***
