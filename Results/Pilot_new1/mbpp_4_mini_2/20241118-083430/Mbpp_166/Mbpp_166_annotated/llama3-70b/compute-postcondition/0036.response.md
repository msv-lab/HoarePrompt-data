The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `len(nums)` does not affect the state. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `len(nums)` is greater than 5.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, and `len(nums)` is greater than 5**
