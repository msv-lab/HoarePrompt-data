Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd), then `count` is incremented by 1 for each valid pair found. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is at least 3, the loop will execute at least once, checking pairs starting from `j = 3` up to `len(nums) - 1`.**
