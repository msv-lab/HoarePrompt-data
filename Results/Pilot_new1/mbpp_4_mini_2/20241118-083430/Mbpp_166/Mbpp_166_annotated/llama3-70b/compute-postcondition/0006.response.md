According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `j` will be starting from `i + 1`, which is 1. Since `nums` is a list with at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. If `j` starts at 1, it will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to 2 (if `len(nums)` is at least 3).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be set to 1 (the current value at the start of the loop).
- The length of `nums` must be at least 2 to ensure that `j` can be incremented.

Since `i` is 0 and `count` is 0, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `j` can be incremented to 1 and that `nums` has at least 2 elements.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
