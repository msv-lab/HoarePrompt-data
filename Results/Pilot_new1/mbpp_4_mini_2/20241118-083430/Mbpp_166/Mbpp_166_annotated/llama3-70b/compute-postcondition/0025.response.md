According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i + 3`. Since it is ensured that `nums` has a length greater than `i + 3`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `i + 4`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are as follows:
- `j` should be updated to `i + 4`.

The other states remain unchanged.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, `nums` has a length greater than `i + 4`, `j` is equal to `i + 4`**
