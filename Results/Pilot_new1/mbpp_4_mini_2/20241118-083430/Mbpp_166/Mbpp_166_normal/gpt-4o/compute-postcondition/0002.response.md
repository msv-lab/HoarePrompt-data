The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `even_count` is known from the initial state, and it represents the count of even integers in `lst`. The calculation will yield the number of unique pairs of even integers. The values of `lst`, `odd_count`, and any other variables are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the output state will include the values of `even_count` and `even_pairs`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2**
