Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the total number of unique pairs that can be formed from even integers and odd integers within the list. It returns the sum of pairs formed by even integers and pairs formed by odd integers. If `lst` is empty or contains only one element, it will return 0 since no pairs can be formed. **
