To evaluate the correctness of the provided function, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description**: The function should count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    even_count = sum((1 for x in lst if x % 2 == 0))
    odd_count = len(lst) - even_count
    even_pairs = even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2
    odd_pairs = odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2
    return even_pairs + odd_pairs
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **XOR and Even Numbers**: The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are even or both are odd. This means we need to count pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers.
2. **Counting Pairs**: The program correctly counts the number of even integers and odd integers, and then calculates the number of unique pairs that can be formed from them using the combination formula \( C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

### Edge Cases:
- An empty list should return 0 because no pairs can be formed.
- A list with only one element should also return 0 for the same reason.
- A list with only even numbers or only odd numbers should return the count of pairs that can be formed from those integers.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and calculates the total number of unique pairs that can be formed from even integers and odd integers within the list.
- It returns the sum of pairs formed by even integers and pairs formed by odd integers.
- If `lst` is empty or contains only one element, it will return 0 since no pairs can be formed.

### Agreement Check:
- The output hints correctly describe the logic implemented in the code, which counts pairs of even and odd integers.
- The hints also correctly note that for an empty list or a list with one element, the return value will be 0, aligning with the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the function and the output hints, I can confirm that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description in all cases, including edge cases. 

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly counts pairs of integers that XOR to an even number by counting pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers, and it handles edge cases appropriately.
