To assess the correctness of the provided program, we first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** The task is to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Initial Assessment
The program uses nested loops to iterate through all pairs of integers in the list `nums`. For each pair `(nums[i], nums[j])`, it checks if the result of the bitwise XOR operation is even. If it is, the `count` is incremented.

To determine if the XOR of two numbers is even, we can note that:
- The XOR of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or odd (i.e., they have the same parity).

Thus, the check `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` is valid for determining if both integers have the same parity. 

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty List:** If `nums` is empty, there are no pairs to consider, and the function should return 0. The code handles this correctly since no pairs will be formed.
2. **Single Element List:** If `nums` has only one integer, there are also no pairs to consider, and the function should return 0. The code handles this correctly as well.
3. **All Even or All Odd:** The function should count all pairs correctly in these scenarios.
4. **Mixed Parity:** The function should not count pairs where one number is odd and the other is even.

### Output Hints
The output hints state that the function returns the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). It also confirms that if `nums` is empty or contains only one integer, the function returns 0.

### Agreement Check
The output hints align with the logic of the code. The function indeed counts pairs of integers that have the same parity, thus producing the correct output as described.

### Conclusion
The code correctly implements the requirements of the problem description and handles edge cases as expected. There are no potential cases where the code fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
