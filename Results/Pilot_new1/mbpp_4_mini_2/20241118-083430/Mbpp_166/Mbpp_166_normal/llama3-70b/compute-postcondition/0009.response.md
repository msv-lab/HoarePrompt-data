According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`. Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, it has a length of at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `nums`.

Given that `j` is currently `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `len(nums)`. If `j` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop will not execute again. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. `j` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.
2. We need to ensure that `j` remains less than the length of `nums`.

Therefore, we can set `j` to `i + 2` to ensure that it is one step ahead for the next iteration. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` remains unchanged.**
