According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop starts from `i + 1`, which means it will execute if `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`. Given that `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute as long as the length of `nums` is greater than 1.

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `j` will be equal to `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nums` must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 0, and `j` will start at 1 (the first index after `i`).

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
