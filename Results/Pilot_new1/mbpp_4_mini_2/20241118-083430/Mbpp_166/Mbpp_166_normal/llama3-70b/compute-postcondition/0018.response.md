Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both numbers share the same parity, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have different parities, `count` remains unchanged.***
