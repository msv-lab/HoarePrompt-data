Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd after all iterations of the loop. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop will execute at least once, and for each valid `j`, if `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.**
