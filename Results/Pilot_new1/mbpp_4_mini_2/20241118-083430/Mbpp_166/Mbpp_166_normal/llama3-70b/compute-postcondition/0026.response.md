Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `i + 1`, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop will execute for each `j` starting from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. For each iteration, if the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**
