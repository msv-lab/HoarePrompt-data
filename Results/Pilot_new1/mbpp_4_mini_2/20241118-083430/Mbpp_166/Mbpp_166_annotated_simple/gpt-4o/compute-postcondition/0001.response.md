The code assigns the value of `len(lst) - even_count` to `odd_count`. The length of the list `lst` is the total count of integers in it, and `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`. Therefore, `odd_count` will represent the count of odd integers in the list. The state of `lst` and `even_count` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst**
