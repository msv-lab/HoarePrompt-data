To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we will analyze the code and the comments provided.

### Problem Description
The task is to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `len(nums)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums)` is 2, the loop executes once and increments `count` by 1 if the XOR is even, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is greater than 2, the loop will execute multiple times, and `count` will reflect the total number of valid pairs found.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where nums[i] and nums[j] have the same parity
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **XOR and Even Numbers**: The XOR of two integers results in an even number if both integers are either even or odd. This is because:
   - Even XOR Even = Even
   - Odd XOR Odd = Even
   - Even XOR Odd = Odd

2. **Logic of the Code**: The program iterates through all pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `i < j` and checks if the result of `nums[i] ^ nums[j]` is even. If it is, it increments the count.

3. **Count Calculation**: The count variable accumulates the number of pairs that satisfy the condition of having the same parity.

### Potential Issues
- The program correctly identifies pairs whose XOR is even based on the parity of the numbers. However, it does not explicitly check for the case when the list is empty or has only one element, which would naturally lead to a count of zero pairs. This is handled correctly as the loop does not execute in those cases, but the comment could mislead someone to think that it handles those cases differently.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the code and the logic, it is clear that the program correctly counts the number of pairs whose XOR is even by checking their parity. The provided annotations correctly describe the behavior of the code.

Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
