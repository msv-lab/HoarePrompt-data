Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (i, j) where `i` is `k + 1` and `j` ranges from `k + 2` to `len(nums) - 1` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to `k + 1`, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is exactly `k + 2`, the loop executes once. If `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 2`, the loop executes multiple times, depending on the length of `nums`.**
