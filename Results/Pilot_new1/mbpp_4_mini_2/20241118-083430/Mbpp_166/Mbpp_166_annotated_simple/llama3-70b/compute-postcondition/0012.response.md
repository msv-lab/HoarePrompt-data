According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. The condition for the loop to execute one more time is that `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `nums` has at least `i + 2` integers, `len(nums)` is at least `i + 2`, which means `j` is equal to `len(nums)` at the end of the last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to `i + 3`, and the length of `nums` must be at least `i + 3`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be `i + 3`
- `nums` should be a list of integers with at least `i + 3` integers.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least `i + 3` integers, `j` is `i + 3`, and `count` remains unchanged**
