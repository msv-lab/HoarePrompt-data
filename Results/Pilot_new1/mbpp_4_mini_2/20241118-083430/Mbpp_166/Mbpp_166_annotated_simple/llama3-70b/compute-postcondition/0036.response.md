The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is not specified, so we cannot determine its exact new value. The values of `j` and `len(nums)` remain unchanged, but since `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 3`, this condition does not affect the state. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `count`.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `j` is `k + 3`, `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 3**
