Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `i` is fixed and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`, such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If `len(nums)` is 1, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums)` is 2, the loop executes once and increments `count` by 1 if the XOR is even, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.**
