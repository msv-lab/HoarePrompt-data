According to the code, the loop can execute again if the index `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `len(lst) - 1`. 

Additionally, since `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, it remains unchanged in terms of its size. The loop will now be checking the last element against a non-existent next element (since `i + 1` would be out of bounds), but the state of the list itself does not need to change.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`**
