The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the function checks if each element is greater than the next. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `False`. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, no comparisons are made, and the function does not return any value, implying that the state of the program remains unchanged. If none of the conditions for returning `False` are met, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, or return `False` if it is not, while handling cases where the list has fewer than 2 elements by not performing any comparisons. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns `False` if any element is greater than the next in a list of at least 2 elements; if lst has fewer than 2 elements, it does not return anything, and if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`.**
