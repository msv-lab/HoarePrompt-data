Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

1. The function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next one.
2. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The assertions provided also cover various cases:
- The first assertion checks a sorted list and returns `True`, which is correct.
- The second assertion checks a list that is not sorted and returns `False`, which is also correct.
- The third assertion checks another unsorted list and returns `False`, which is again correct.

The function handles lists of various lengths, including edge cases like an empty list or a single-element list, both of which are sorted by definition. Therefore, I see no potential cases where the function fails to meet the problem description.
