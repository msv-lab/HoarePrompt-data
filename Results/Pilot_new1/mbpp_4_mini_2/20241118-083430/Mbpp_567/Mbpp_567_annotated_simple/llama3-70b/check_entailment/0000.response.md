Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one. It returns `True` if all comparisons hold (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next), and `False` otherwise.

The logic is sound for all potential cases:
1. An empty list returns `True` since there are no elements to violate the sorted condition.
2. A list with a single element also returns `True` for the same reason.
3. A list with multiple elements is checked pairwise, ensuring that the condition for non-decreasing order is met.

There are no missing edge cases or logic flaws in the implementation, and it adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
