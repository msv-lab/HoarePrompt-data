According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` must be such that it is less than `len(lst) - 1` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is currently at the last value that satisfies the condition (`len(lst) - 2`), to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `len(lst) - 1`. 

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to set `i` to `len(lst) - 1`. There are no other states that need to be modified since `lst` remains unchanged and still has at least 2 elements.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`**
