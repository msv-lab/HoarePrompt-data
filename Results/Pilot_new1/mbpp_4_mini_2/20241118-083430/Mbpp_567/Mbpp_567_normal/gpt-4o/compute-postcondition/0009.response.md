Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).***
