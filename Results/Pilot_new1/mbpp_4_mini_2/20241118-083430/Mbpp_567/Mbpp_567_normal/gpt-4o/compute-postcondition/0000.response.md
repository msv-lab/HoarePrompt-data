According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. The loop will execute if the length of `lst` is greater than 1 because `len(lst) - 1` must be at least 0 for the range to have any iterations. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute with `i` starting at 0. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 2 comparable elements, and `i` should be initialized to 0. 

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
