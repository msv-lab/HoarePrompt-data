Output State: **If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the loop checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. If all comparisons are satisfied (i.e., `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]` for all valid `i`), the loop completes without returning, implying that `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None).**
