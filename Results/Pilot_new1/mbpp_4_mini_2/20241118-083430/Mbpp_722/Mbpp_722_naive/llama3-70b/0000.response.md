Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters out students from the dictionary based on the provided minimum height and weight. It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the items of the `student_data` dictionary and checks if both the height and weight of each student meet or exceed the specified minimum values. 

It handles all potential cases:
1. If a student's height or weight is below the minimum, they are excluded from the resulting dictionary.
2. If all students meet the criteria, all will be included.
3. If no students meet the criteria, an empty dictionary will be returned.

Since the logic correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
