Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly filters students based on their height and weight compared to the provided minimum values. It iterates through the dictionary of students, checking each student's height and weight against `min_height` and `min_weight`. The assertions provided in the code demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. 

- In the first assertion, only 'Cierra Vega' meets the criteria of height ≥ 6.0 and weight ≥ 70.
- In the second assertion, both 'Cierra Vega' and 'Kierra Gentry' meet the criteria of height ≥ 5.9 and weight ≥ 67.
- In the third assertion, all students meet the criteria of height ≥ 5.7 and weight ≥ 64.

Since the function works correctly for all provided test cases and adheres to the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
