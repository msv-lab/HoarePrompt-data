The provided program is designed to filter students based on their height and weight, ensuring that both metrics meet or exceed specified minimum values. 

### Initial Assessment:
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. It constructs a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and whose weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

The logic appears sound, as it uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the `student_data` and applies the necessary conditions to filter the students. 

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Dictionary**: If `student_data` is empty, the function should return an empty dictionary. This case seems to be handled correctly.
2. **All Students Below Minimums**: If all students have height and weight below the specified minimums, the function should also return an empty dictionary. This is also handled correctly.
3. **Boundary Conditions**: Students who have exactly the minimum height or weight should be included in the result. The code checks for `>=`, which is correct.
4. **Non-numeric Values**: If `student_data` contains non-numeric values for height or weight, the program will raise an error. This case is not handled.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, and that it will return an empty dictionary if no students meet the criteria. This aligns with the functionality of the code.

### Conclusion:
While the function appears to work correctly for the described scenarios, it does not account for potential issues with non-numeric values in the height and weight tuples, which could lead to runtime errors. Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to this oversight, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails to handle cases where the height and weight values are non-numeric, which could result in a TypeError when attempting to compare them with the minimum values.
