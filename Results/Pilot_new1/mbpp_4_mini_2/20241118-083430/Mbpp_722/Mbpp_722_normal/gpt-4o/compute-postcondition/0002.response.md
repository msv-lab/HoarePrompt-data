Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary of students with their heights and weights, along with minimum height and weight thresholds. It returns a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with the students' names as keys and their corresponding (height, weight) tuples as values. The function does not handle cases where the input dictionary is empty or where the height or weight values are not numeric, but it will effectively filter out any students that do not meet the specified criteria. **
