To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description.

The problem description requires a function that filters students from a dictionary based on their height and weight, ensuring that both values exceed specified minimum thresholds.

### Analysis of the Code:
The provided function is as follows:

```python
def func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for (name, (height, weight)) in student_data.items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
```

1. **Input Structure**: The function takes three arguments:
   - `student_data`: A dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples containing height and weight.
   - `min_height`: A float representing the minimum height a student must have.
   - `min_weight`: A float representing the minimum weight a student must have.

2. **Output Structure**: The function returns a dictionary of students who meet the height and weight requirements.

3. **Logic**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items in `student_data`. It checks if each student's height and weight are greater than or equal to `min_height` and `min_weight`, respectively. If both conditions are met, that student is included in the output dictionary.

### Potential Edge Cases:
To determine if the function is correct, we need to consider edge cases, such as:
- Students who are exactly at the minimum height and weight (should be included).
- Students who are below the minimum height or weight (should be excluded).
- An empty dictionary (should return an empty dictionary).
- Negative values for height or weight (should be handled correctly).

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Exact Minimums**:
   ```python
   student_data = {'Alice': (150.0, 50.0), 'Bob': (145.0, 45.0)}
   min_height = 150.0
   min_weight = 50.0
   result = func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight)
   # Expected: {'Alice': (150.0, 50.0)}
   ```

2. **Empty Input**:
   ```python
   student_data = {}
   min_height = 150.0
   min_weight = 50.0
   result = func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight)
   # Expected: {}
   ```

3. **Negative Values**:
   ```python
   student_data = {'Charlie': (-1.0, 50.0), 'David': (160.0, -5.0)}
   min_height = 150.0
   min_weight = 50.0
   result = func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight)
   # Expected: {}
   ```

### Conclusion:
After considering these edge cases, we find that the function behaves correctly in all tested scenarios. It includes students who meet or exceed the minimums, excludes those who do not, and handles an empty input appropriately.

Thus, I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
