The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` where keys are student names and values are tuples containing height and weight. It also accepts two float parameters, `min_height` and `min_weight`. The function returns a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet these criteria, an empty dictionary is returned.
