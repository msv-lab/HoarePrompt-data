The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings (representing student names) and values are tuples of two floats (representing student height and weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students based on their height and weight against specified minimum values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of students with their heights and weights, along with minimum height and weight values, and returns a dictionary of students whose height and weight meet or exceed these minimum values.**
