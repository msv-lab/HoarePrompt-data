The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that can contain any type of elements. There are two main cases to consider for the return values:

Case 1: If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element and contains `None`, the function will return `True` upon encountering the first `None` item. If `tup` has no `None` elements, the function will execute for each element without returning, and it will not have a defined return value. If `tup` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will not return anything, leaving the state unchanged.

Case 2: The program returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return `True` if it contains a `None` element. If `tup` is empty or contains no `None` elements, it will not return anything. Additionally, the function may return `False` under certain conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `tup`, and returns `True` if `tup` contains a `None` element. If `tup` is empty or contains no `None` elements, it does not return anything. The function may also return `False` under certain conditions.**
