Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks if the given tuple contains any `None` values. It iterates through each item in the tuple and returns `True` if it finds a `None`, or `False` if it completes the iteration without finding any. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases:

1. `func_1((10, 4, 5, 6, None))` returns `True` because there is a `None` value.
2. `func_1((7, 8, 9, 11, 14))` returns `False` because there are no `None` values.
3. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, None))` returns `True` because there is a `None` value.

Since the function handles the specified requirements correctly for all possible cases, it is deemed correct.
