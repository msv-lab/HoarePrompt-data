Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(tup)` correctly checks if there are any `None` values in the given tuple. It uses the built-in `any()` function along with a generator expression that iterates through each element `x` in the tuple `tup` and checks if `x` is `None`. 

This implementation works correctly for all potential cases, including:
- A tuple with no `None` values (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)` should return `False`).
- A tuple with one or more `None` values (e.g., `(1, None, 3)` should return `True`).
- An empty tuple (e.g., `()` should return `False`).

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all cases, it is considered correct.
