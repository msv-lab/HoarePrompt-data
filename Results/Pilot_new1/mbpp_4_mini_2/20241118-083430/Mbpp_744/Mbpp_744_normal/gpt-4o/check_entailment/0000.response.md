To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** The task is to write a function that checks if a given tuple has any `None` value or not. The function should return `True` if there is at least one `None` value in the tuple, and `False` if there are no `None` values.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup):
    for item in tup:
        if item is None:
            return True
    return False
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and checks if any element in `tup` is `None`, returning `True` if it finds one. If all elements are not `None`, it returns `False`. If `tup` is empty, it also returns `False`, as the loop does not execute and the function reaches the return statement.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates through each item in the tuple.
2. If it finds an item that is `None`, it immediately returns `True`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding a `None`, it returns `False`.
4. The function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty tuple; however, since the loop does not execute for an empty tuple, it will reach the return statement and return `False`.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty tuple should return `False`, which is handled correctly by the current implementation.
- A tuple containing only `None` values should return `True`, which is also handled correctly.
- A tuple with mixed values and at least one `None` should return `True`, which is handled correctly.
- A tuple with no `None` values should return `False`, which is handled correctly.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints correctly describe the function's behavior:
- It checks for `None` values and returns `True` if found.
- It returns `False` if no `None` values are present or if the tuple is empty.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves as expected according to the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases. 

Correctness: **True**.
