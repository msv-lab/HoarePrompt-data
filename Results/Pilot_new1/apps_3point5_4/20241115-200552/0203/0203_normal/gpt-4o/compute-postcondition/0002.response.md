Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. The variables `n` and `votes` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_queue` is an empty list**
