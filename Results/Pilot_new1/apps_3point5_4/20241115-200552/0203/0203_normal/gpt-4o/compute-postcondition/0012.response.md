Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `r_queue`. Since the value of `i` is not given, we can't determine the exact value that is appended. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated based on the next character being processed in `votes`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are updated based on the next character being processed in `votes`.**
