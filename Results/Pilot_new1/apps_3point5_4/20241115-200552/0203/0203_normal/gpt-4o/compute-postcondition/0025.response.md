Output State: **After not entering the if condition, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If the loop does not execute, `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`.**
