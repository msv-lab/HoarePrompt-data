Example Answer:
The index `i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. As the current character being processed is 'D', the index `i` will be appended to the `d_queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue contains all 'D' characters from votes with the appended index `i`, r_queue contains all 'R' characters from votes, i represents the index of the current character being processed, v represents the current character. The current character being processed is 'D'.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue contains all 'D' characters from votes with the appended index `i`, r_queue contains all 'R' characters from votes, i represents the index of the current character being processed, v represents the current character. The current character being processed is 'D'**
