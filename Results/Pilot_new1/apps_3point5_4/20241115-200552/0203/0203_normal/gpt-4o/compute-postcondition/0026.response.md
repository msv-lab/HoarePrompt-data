Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes` and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. If the loop does not execute, `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`.***
