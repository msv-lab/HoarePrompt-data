The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string of fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and non-'D' fractions in the input string. If the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of non-'D' fractions, it prints 'D', otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid or empty, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
