According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the fractions list having at least 1 fraction left. At the end of the last iteration, if the last fraction processed was 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains the same, and the fractions list still has at least 1 fraction. If the last fraction processed was not 'D', `depublicans` and `remocrats` have been adjusted based on the last fraction processed, `remocrats` has been incremented by 1, and the fractions list still has at least 1 fraction. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the fractions list must still have at least 1 fraction.
State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, fractions list still has at least 1 fraction**
