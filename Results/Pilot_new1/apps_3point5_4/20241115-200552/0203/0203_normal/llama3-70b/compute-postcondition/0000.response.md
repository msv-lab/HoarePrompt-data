Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the number of employees. The input characters represent the fractions of employees, where each character is either 'D' for depublicans or 'R' for remocrats. Therefore, after execution, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of employees, and the input characters represent the fractions of depublicans and remocrats.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, input characters represent the fractions of depublicans and remocrats**
