Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so after execution, `remocrats` is increased by 1. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing the number of employees, fractions list still has at least 1 fraction, `remocrats` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, fractions list still has at least 1 fraction, `remocrats` is increased by 1**
