Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer and fractions is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and fractions is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters**
