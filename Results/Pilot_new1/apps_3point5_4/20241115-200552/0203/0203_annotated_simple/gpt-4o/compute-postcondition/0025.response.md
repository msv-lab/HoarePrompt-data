Output State: **If votes is an empty string, then r_queue and d_queue are empty. Otherwise, after executing the code, r_queue contains the indices of the characters in votes that are not 'D' along with the value of r_index + n appended, and d_queue contains the indices of the characters in votes that are 'D'. i is equal to the total number of characters processed, v is the next character in the votes string, and d_index is the index popped from d_queue.**
