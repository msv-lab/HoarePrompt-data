Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input string to separate the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters into two separate queues. Then, it simulates the voting process by popping elements from both queues based on the index values and appending them back with n added if needed. Finally, it determines the outcome of the vote based on which queue is non-empty. The program handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
