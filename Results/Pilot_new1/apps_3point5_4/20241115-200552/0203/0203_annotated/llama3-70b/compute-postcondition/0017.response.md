Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters. If the next character in `fractions` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. After the execution of the if-else block, if the next character in `fractions` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1, and `remocrats` remains the same. If the next character is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1, and `depublicans` remains the same. This covers all possible cases after the if-else block is executed.***
