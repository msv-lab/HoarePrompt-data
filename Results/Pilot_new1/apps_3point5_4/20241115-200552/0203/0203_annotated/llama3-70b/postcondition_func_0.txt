The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `fractions` from user input. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and non-'D' characters in the string. If the count of 'D' characters is greater than the count of non-'D' characters, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return any value. The function assumes that `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000, and `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of only 'D' and 'R' characters.
