Example Answer:
r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue, and then r_index + n is appended to the r_queue. The value of n is unknown, so the new state of r_queue will depend on the value of n. 
Output State: **r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue, r_queue contains the result of appending r_index + n**
