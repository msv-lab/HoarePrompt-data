Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all the remainders of dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It returns 'No' if any remainder is repeated and 'Yes' if all remainders are distinct. The code also handles the edge case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n` by returning 'No' in such cases. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of the functionality of the function. Therefore, the code is correct.
