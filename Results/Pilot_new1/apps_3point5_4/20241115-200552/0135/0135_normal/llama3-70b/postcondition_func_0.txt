The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder repeats. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters, and the input integers `n` and `k` must satisfy 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
