Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder repeats.
- If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as it ensures that all remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders.
- The output 'Yes' is printed only if all remainders are distinct, and 'No' is printed if any remainder repeats.
- The code handles the constraints of 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 as specified in the problem description.
- Therefore, the code is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.
