The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, then iterates over numbers from 1 to `k` checking for repeated remainders when dividing `n` by these numbers. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits the loop. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
