Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is positive, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If the `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying any variables.***
