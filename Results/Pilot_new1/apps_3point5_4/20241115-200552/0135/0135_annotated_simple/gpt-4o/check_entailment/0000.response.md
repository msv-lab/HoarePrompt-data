Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. It first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, in which case it returns 'No'. Then, it initializes a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders obtained from dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k`. It iterates over the range from 1 to `k` and calculates the remainder for each `i`. If the current remainder is already in the set `seen_remainders`, it returns 'No' indicating that there are duplicate remainders. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes'. 

The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders are distinct and returns the appropriate output 'Yes' or 'No'. The logic implemented in the program ensures that it covers all potential cases and correctly determines if the remainders are distinct.
