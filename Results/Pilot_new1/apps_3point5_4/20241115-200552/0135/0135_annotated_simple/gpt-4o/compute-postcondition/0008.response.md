Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `i` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` ≥ 1. `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If the `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
