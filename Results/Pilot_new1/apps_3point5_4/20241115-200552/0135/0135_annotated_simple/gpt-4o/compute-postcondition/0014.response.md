Output State: **If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute and the output will be 'No'. If the loop does execute, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18 and `k` ≥ 1. `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` ranges from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'.**
