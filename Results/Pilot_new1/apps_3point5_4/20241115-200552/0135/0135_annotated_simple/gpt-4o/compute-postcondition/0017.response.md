Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than n, the function iterates through a loop from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If a previously seen remainder is encountered, the function returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.**
