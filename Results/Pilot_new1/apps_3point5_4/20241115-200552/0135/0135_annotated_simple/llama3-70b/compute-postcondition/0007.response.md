Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i. If the value of `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits.***
