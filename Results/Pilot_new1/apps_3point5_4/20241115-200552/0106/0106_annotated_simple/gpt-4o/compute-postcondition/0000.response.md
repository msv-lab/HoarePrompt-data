Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `apartment` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the value of `apartment`. The value of `m`, `n`, and `k` are given as positive integers between 1 and 1000, so the value of `block` will be determined based on the given values of `m`, `n`, `k`, and `apartment`.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of `apartment`, `m`, `n`, and `k`**
