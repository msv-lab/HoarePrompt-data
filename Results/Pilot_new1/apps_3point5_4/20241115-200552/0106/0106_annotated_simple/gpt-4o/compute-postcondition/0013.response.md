The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function calculates and returns the total time based on the initial state values provided by the parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept five positive integers n, m, k, a, and b, and return the total time calculated based on the initial state values. 
Functionality: **The function accepts five positive integers n, m, k, a, and b and returns the total time calculated based on the initial state values.**
