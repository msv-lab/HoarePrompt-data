Example Answer: 
The value of `floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1. The previous values of `floor_within_block` and `k` are unknown, so the exact value of `floor` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `floor_within_block` holds a specific value based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k; `floor` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`floor_within_block` holds a specific value based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k; `floor` is calculated based on the formula provided**
