Functionality: ** The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment` and calculates the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the provided formulas. The function correctly calculates the block and floor numbers for the given apartment. However, it is assumed that the variables `m` and `k` are defined elsewhere in the code since they are used in the calculations without being passed as parameters to the function. The code does not handle potential division by zero errors or negative values for `apartment`. **
