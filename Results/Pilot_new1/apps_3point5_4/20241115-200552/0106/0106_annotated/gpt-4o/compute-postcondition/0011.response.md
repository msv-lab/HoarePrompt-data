Example Answer:
`total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are dependent on the initial values of `time_to_exit`, `floor_a`, `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, `floor_b`, `block_a`, and `block_b`. After the calculations, the final value of `total_time` will be determined based on the initial state.
Output State: **`total_time` is the calculated total time based on the initial state of the variables**
