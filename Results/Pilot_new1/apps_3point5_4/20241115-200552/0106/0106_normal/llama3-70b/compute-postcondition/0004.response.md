Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `b` and `m` are unknown, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `b_floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, and `b_floor` is an unknown value.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a`, `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as described, and `b_floor` is an unknown value**
