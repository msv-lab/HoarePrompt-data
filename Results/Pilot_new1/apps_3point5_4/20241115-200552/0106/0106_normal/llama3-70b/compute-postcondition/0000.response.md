Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values by mapping integers from input split by space. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000**
