Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates various floor and block values based on these inputs. After calculations, it determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors, and prints the sum of these times. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
