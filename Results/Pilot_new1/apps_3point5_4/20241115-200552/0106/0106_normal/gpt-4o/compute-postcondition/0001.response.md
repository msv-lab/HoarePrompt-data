Example Answer:
The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `apartment` determines the result. Without knowing the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the output state is: Dependent on the value of `apartment`.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of `apartment`**
