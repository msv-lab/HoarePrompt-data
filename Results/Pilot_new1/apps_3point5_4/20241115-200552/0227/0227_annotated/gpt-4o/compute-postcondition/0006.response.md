According to the code, the loop can execute if the set `assigned` is not empty. Since the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, we can assume that `assigned` is not empty. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False. 

State: **`assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False**
