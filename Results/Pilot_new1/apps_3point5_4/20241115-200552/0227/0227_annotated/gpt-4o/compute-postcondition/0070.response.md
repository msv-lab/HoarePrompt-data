The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. After completing `n` iterations of a loop, the function returns the final value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and return the final value of `m` after completing `n` iterations of a loop.
