Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, a list of `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. It sorts the list `a`, then iterates through the elements checking if the difference between the current element and any previous element in `assigned` is also in `assigned`. If not, it increments `m`. The function returns the final value of `m` after completing `n` iterations of the loop.**
