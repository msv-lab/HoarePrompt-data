Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. As `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, the output state is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers**
