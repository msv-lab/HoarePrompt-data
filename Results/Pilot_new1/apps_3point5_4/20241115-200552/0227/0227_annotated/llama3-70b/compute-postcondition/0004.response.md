According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is already a positive integer between 1 and 23. However, since the loop starts from 1, the initial value of i should be 1. 
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order; m is 1; i is 1**
