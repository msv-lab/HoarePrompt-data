The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function sorts the list `a`, iterates through it to check if elements can form a certain pattern, and increments `m` based on certain conditions. Finally, it returns the final value of the variable `m` after the loop execution.
