Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the given sequence of integers and keeps track of the numbers that can be formed using the previously assigned variables. The loop increments the variable `m` whenever a number cannot be formed using the existing set of variables. The final value of `m` is returned, which represents the minimum number of variables required. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
