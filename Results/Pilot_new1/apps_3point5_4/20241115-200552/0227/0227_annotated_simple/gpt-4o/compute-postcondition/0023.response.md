Postcondition: ***If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the smallest positive integer `x` is in the set `assigned`, `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. The loop will continue to iterate until this condition is met. If the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False after the loop execution. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `can_form` is False, `m` is incremented by 1.***
