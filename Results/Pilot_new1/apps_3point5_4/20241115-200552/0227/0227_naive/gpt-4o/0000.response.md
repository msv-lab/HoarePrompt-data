Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the input sequence, checks if the difference between the current element and previously assigned elements is present in the assigned set. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The program then returns the minimum number of variables needed. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
