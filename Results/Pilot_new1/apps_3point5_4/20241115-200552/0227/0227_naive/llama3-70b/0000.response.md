Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It first reads the input values, sorts them, and then iterates through the list to determine the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations. The logic used in the program ensures that the variables are assigned in such a way that the described operations can be carried out. The program also handles the case where the number of variables required exceeds 23, in which case it outputs -1. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
