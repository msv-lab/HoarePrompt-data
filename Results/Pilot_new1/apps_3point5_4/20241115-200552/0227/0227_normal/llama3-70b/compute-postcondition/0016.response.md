Example Answer:
The code checks if the value of `m` is less than or equal to 23, and if true, it prints `m`, otherwise, it prints -1. The value of `m` is determined based on the condition mentioned in the initial state. If the condition is met, `m` is printed, else -1 is printed. The loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 1. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer.**
