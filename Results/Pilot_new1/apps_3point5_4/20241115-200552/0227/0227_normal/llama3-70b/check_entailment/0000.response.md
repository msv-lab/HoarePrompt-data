Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input values correctly.
- It sorts the input list in ascending order.
- It iterates through the sorted list to count the number of elements that are not twice the value of the previous element.
- Finally, it prints the count `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` needed to perform the described sequence of operations.
