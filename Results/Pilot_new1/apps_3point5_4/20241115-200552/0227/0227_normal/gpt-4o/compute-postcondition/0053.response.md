According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is a boolean variable, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `assigned` list contains at least 1 element, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `assigned` list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `assigned` list contains at least 2 elements, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list**
