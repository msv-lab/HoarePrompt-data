Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements to check if a pair of elements exist in the `assigned` set such that their difference is also in the set. If such a pair does not exist, it increments the value of `m`. The function then returns the final value of `m` after the loop has been executed. **
