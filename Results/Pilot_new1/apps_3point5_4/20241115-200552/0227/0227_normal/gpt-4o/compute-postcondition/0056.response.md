Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `assigned` list contains at least 3 elements, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables.***
