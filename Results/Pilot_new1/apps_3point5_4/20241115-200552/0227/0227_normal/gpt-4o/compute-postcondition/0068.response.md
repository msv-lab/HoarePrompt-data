Output State: **If there exists a pair of elements x and a[i] in the assigned list such that their difference is also in the assigned list, can_form is set to True. If can_form is False, m is incremented by 1. The loop will not execute if n is less than or equal to 1. In that case, m will remain 1 and assigned will contain the first element of list a.**
