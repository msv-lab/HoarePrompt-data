Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints agree with the code, but after analyzing the code and the problem description, it can be seen that the code may not handle all scenarios correctly. 

One case where the code might not work as expected is when the balance of zeros and ones in the string `s` is not equal to 0. In this scenario, the code calculates the number of prefixes with a balance equal to `x` by iterating through the prefix balances and checking if a certain condition is met. However, there might be cases where this logic does not accurately determine the number of valid prefixes.

Therefore, the code needs to be revised to ensure it covers all potential cases as per the problem description.
