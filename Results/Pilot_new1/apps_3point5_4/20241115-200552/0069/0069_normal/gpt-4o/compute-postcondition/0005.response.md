According to the code, the loop will execute T times where T is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, T is already a positive integer, and index is 1. The results list being empty does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: T is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list.
State: **T is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list**
