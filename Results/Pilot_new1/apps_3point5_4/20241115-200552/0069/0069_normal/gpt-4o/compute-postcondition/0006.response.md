Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of the integer at index 1 of the `data` list. The value at index 1 is unknown, so the value of `n` is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, and `n` is assigned an unknown value.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, and `n` is assigned an unknown value**
