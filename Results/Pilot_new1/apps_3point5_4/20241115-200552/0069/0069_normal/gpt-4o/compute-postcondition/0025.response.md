Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the running balance of zeros and ones in the string s and stores it in prefix_balances. The loop will execute at least once if n is greater than or equal to 1, and the resulting prefix_balances list will have at least 2 elements. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. The balance is equal to 0. If x is in prefix_balances, the results list appends -1. If x is not in prefix_balances, the results list appends 0. This if-else block covers all scenarios of the loop execution and the appending of values to the results list based on the presence of x in prefix_balances.***
