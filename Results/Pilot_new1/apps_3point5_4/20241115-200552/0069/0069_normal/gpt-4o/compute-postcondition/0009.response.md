Example Answer:
The value of `index` is increased by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, index is 4, results is an empty list, n is an unknown value, x is an unknown value, s is an unknown value.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, index is 4, results is an empty list, n is an unknown value, x is an unknown value, s is an unknown value**
