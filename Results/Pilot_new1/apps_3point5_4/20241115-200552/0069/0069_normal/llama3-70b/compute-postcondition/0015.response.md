According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of T. At the end of the last iteration, T is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, T needs to be adjusted to T + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **T + 1 is a positive integer, n and x are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string s, balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the input string s. If balance is equal to x, then the output prints n + 1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), then print -1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0), then print ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)**
