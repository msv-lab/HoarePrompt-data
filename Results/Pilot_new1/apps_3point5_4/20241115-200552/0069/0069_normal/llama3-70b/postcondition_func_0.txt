The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input, then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a string `s`. It calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, then determines a `balance` value by subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's. Depending on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, it prints different values. If `balance` is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If not, it checks if a certain condition is met to print -1, otherwise it calculates and prints a value based on the division of `x - balance` by the difference in counts of '0's and '1's in `s`. The function handles various scenarios based on the input data. The function does not explicitly return any value.
