Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the balance of the string `s` is 0, but there is no prefix of `t` with balance equal to `x`. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 0
101
```

The expected output should be 0 since there are no prefixes of `t` with balance equal to 0. However, the program will output -1 instead.
