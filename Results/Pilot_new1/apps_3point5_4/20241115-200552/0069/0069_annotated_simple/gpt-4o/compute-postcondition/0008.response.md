Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of `data`. Given that `index` is 1, `data` is a list, and `data[3]` is the value at index 3 of the list. Therefore, `s` will contain the value at index 3 of `data`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **T is greater than 0, index is 1, results is an empty list, `n` contains the integer value at index 1 of `data`, `x` contains the integer value at index 2 of `data`, `s` contains the value at index 3 of `data`.**
