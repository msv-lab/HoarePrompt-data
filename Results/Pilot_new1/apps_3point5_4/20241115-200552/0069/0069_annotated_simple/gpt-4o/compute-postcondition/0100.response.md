Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of the balance changes in the string `s`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update the `prefix_balances` list accordingly. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and the `prefix_balances` list will remain filled with zeros. After the loop execution, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance changes up to each index `i` in the string `s`. The balance is not equal to 0***
