Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list or array of values, and `index` is the index of the element being accessed. The value at the specified index is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is an integer**
