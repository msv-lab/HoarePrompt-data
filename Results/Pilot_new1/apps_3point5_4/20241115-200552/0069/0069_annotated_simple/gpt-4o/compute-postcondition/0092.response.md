According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 4 to execute the loop one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 4]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 5]`, `index` is increased by 6, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with updated values, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated value, `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
