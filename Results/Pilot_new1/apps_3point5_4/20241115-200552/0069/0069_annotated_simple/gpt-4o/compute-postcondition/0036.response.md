Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `x` contains the integer value at index 2 of data, `s` contains the value at index 3 of data, `balance` is the result of counting '0's minus counting '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` and has values calculated based on the formula, `i` is within the range of 1 to `n` inclusive, `count` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are satisfied, `b` is a value in the list and `count` is incremented by 1.**
