Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`**
