Postcondition: ***T is greater than 0, index is 4, results is an empty list, n is greater than 0, x contains the integer value at index 2 of data, s contains the value at index 3 of data, balance is the result of counting '0's minus counting '1's in string s, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1 and has values calculated based on the formula, i is within the range of 1 to n inclusive, count is 0, x and b are integers, (x - b) % balance equals 0, (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0***
