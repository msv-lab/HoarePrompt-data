Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all scenarios where the initial integer `count` is updated based on the conditions specified in the if statement, ensuring that the division by `balance` results in a non-negative value.***
