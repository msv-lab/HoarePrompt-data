Example Answer:
A list `prefix_balances` is created with a length of `n + 1` where each element is initialized to 0. The initial state variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is assigned the value extracted from `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` initialized to 0, `n` is the integer value extracted from `data[index]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` contains the appended count, `x` is an integer extracted from `data[index + 1], `index` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`s` is assigned the value extracted from `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` initialized to 0, `n` is the integer value extracted from `data[index]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `results` contains the appended count, `x` is an integer extracted from `data[index + 1], `index` is increased by 3**
