Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of the values determined by the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) for each index i from 0 to n. If n is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1. If balance is equal to 0, the `results` list appends -1 if x is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise, appends 0. If prefix_balances has at least one element and balance is not 0, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances that satisfy the conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0) and ((x - b) // balance >= 0), and this count value is appended to the `results` list. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases where n is less than 1, x is not found in `prefix_balances`, and the conditions for count calculation are met.***
