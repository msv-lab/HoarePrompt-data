According to the code, the loop can execute as long as prefix_balances is not empty. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: prefix_balances is not empty, b is the first element in prefix_balances, and index is increased by 3.
State: **s is assigned the value extracted from data[index + 2], prefix_balances is a non-empty list of integers with length n + 1, n is the integer value extracted from data[index], balance is not equal to 0, results contains the appended count, x is an integer extracted from data[index + 1], index is increased by 3, count is 0, b is the first element in prefix_balances**
