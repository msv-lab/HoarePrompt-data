Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of the values determined by the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1) for each index i from 0 to n. If n is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1. If x is in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list appends -1. Otherwise, if x is not in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list appends 0. This covers all possible scenarios including the edge cases where n is less than 1 and x is not found in `prefix_balances`.***
