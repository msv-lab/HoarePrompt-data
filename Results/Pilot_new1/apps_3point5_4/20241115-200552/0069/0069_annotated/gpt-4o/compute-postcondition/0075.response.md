According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `prefix_balances` and the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` that has not been iterated over yet. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `prefix_balances` that has not been iterated over yet should be selected as `b`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **After the execution of the loop, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` that has not been iterated over yet.**
