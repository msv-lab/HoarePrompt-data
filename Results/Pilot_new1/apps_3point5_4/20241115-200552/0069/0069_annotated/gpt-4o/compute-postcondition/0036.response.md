Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so after execution, `count` will be 1. The list `prefix_balances` remains unchanged as it was specified to move to the next element in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s, moving to the next element in the list, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s, moving to the next element in the list, `count` is 1**
