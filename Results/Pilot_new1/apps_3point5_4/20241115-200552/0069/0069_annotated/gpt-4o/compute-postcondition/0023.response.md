Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers. The loop calculates the prefix sums of the balance values in `s` and stores them in `prefix_balances`. The loop has executed at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with 0s. If `balance` is 0, the program does not find `x` in `prefix_balances`***
