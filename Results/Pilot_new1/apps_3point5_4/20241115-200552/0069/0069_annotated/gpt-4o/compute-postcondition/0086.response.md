According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute successfully:

State: **s is assigned the value data[index + 2], prefix_balances is a list of integers with length n + 1, n is an integer value from data at index position, balance is recalculated based on the counts of '0's and '1's in s, results is updated, x is assigned the integer value from data at index + 1, index is increased by 3, prefix_balances is initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1, n is at least 1, i is 1**
