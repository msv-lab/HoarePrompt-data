Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, _ is 0, n and x are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0's in s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in s, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including edge cases, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions of the if-else block.***
