According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, the cubes list contains integers obtained from user input split by spaces, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 cube. The digits set is empty at the beginning of the loop.
State: **`n` is 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube obtained from user input split by spaces for each iteration of the range of `n`; `digits` is an empty set**
