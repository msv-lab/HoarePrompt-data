The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). The function calculates the number of times `can_form_number` evaluates to true for `x`. The loop continues incrementing `x` until `can_form_number(x + 1)` is false. The function then returns the final value of `x`.
