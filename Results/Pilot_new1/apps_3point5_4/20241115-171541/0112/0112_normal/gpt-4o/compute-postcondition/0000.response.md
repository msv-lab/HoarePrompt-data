Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string. Since the value of `num` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition: n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).**
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).**
