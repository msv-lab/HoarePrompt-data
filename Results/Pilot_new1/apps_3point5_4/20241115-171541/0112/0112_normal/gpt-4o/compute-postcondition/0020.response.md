According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 4, cube_faces is a list of n lists, used_cubes is a list of n booleans with at least one element set to True, and found is True. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n` and incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 4. cube_faces is a list of n lists, used_cubes is a list of n booleans, with at least one element set to True. found is True.**
