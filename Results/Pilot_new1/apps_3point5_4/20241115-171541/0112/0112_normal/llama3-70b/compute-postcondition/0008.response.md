Example Answer: 
The code updates the `digits` set with the digits of the first cube in the `cubes` list. The `digits` set now contains the digits of the first cube. Since the first cube is a cube, the digits will be from 0 to 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits from 0 to 9.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits from 0 to 9**
