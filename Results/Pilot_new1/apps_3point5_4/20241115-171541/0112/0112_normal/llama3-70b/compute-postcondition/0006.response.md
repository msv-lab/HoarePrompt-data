Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the digits of the first cube in the list `cubes`. Since the value of `n` is between 1 and 3, and `cubes` has at least 2 cubes, we know there is at least one cube in the list. Therefore, the set `digits` is updated with the digits of the first cube. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube in the cubes list**
