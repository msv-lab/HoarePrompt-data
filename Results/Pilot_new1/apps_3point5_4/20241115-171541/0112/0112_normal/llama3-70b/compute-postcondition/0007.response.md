According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of cubes in the list. If there are at least 3 cubes in the list, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube in the cubes list. To execute the loop one more time, the list of cubes must have at least 3 cubes. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` cubes with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube in the cubes list**
