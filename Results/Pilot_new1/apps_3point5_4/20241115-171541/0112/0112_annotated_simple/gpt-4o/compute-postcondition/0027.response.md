According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, found is False. To execute the loop one more time, the found variable needs to be adjusted to True to indicate that the condition for the loop to continue has been met.
State: **found is True**
