According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `digits`. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `digits` has at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the list. Additionally, the other states remain unchanged.
