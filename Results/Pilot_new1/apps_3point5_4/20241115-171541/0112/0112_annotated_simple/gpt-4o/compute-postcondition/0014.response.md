Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; cube_faces is a list of n lists; digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number with at least 1 digit; digit is the first digit in the list; used_cubes is a list of n False values with the 1st and ith elements set to True if not already set to True and the rest remain False; found is True if the digit is found in the faces of the 1st cube; i is 1. If the digit is in the faces of the 1st cube and the 1st and ith elements of used_cubes are set to True, then found is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
