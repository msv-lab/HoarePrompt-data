Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for the next `num`, `total_sum` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged. The previous value of `total_sum` is unknown, so the output state is: `total_sum` is updated based on the condition `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the condition `(total_sum + num) % MOD`**
