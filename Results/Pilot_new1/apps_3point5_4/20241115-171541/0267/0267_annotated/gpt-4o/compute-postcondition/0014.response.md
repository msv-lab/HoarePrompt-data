The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the updated value of total_sum after evaluating func_1(num, k) for each num in the range [l, r] and updating total_sum accordingly. If l is greater than r, total_sum remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and update total_sum based on the evaluation of func_1(num, k) for each num in the range [l, r]. If l is greater than r, total_sum remains 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts integers l, r, and k. It updates total_sum based on the evaluation of func_1(num, k) for each num in the range [l, r]. If l is greater than r, total_sum remains 0.**
