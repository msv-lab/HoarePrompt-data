According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range of `num` from `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer that may or may not have been updated based on the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)`. To execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to the next value within the range (from `l` to `r`). If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for this next `num`, then `total_sum` should be updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for the next `num`, `total_sum` remains unchanged.
State: **total_sum is an integer. If func_1(num, k) evaluates to true for the next num, total_sum is updated to the result of (total_sum + num) % MOD. In all other cases, total_sum remains unchanged.**
