The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. However, the actual implementation of the count function and the value of MOD are not provided in the code, so the functionality relies heavily on the proper implementation of the count function and the specific value of MOD.
