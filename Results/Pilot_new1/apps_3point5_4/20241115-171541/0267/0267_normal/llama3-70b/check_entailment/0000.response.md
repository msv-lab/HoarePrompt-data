Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions `func_1` and `count` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`.
- The `count` function correctly handles the calculation based on the values of `n` and `k`, adjusting the result within a specific range. It considers different cases and updates the value in the `dp` dictionary accordingly.
- The `func_1` function then uses the `count` function to calculate the final result by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r`, and then taking the result modulo `998244353`.
- The code structure aligns with the problem description, and the logic within the functions seems to cover all potential cases as specified in the problem statement.
- The output hints also correspond to the code functionality, providing a clear explanation of how the functions work together to achieve the desired outcome.
