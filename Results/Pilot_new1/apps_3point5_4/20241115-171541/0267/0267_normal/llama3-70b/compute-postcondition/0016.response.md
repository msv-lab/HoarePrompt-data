According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, the updated value of `dp[n, k]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after incrementing it by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, the updated value of `dp[n, k]`, and `i` is the next value after incrementing by 1**
