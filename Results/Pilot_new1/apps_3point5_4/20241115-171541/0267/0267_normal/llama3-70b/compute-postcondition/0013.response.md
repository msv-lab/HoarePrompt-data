Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `i` is `k-1`. Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`**
