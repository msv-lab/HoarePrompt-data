The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a non-negative integer, `k`, which is a positive integer, and `dp`, which is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. 

Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. There is no change to the values of `n`, `k`, or `dp`.

Case 2: If (n, k) is already a key in `dp`, then the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of `n`, `k`, or `dp`.

Case 3: The function returns the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept three parameters: a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` storing previously calculated values. The function then returns different values based on the conditions specified in the cases above.
