Example Answer: 
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9, and the result of the expression depends on the values of `n` and `k`. Since the values of `n` and `k` are not specified, the exact result cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, and `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the given expression.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, and `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the given expression**
