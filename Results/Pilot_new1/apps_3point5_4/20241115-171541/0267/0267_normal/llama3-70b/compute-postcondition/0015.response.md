Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is unknown. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, the updated value of `dp[n, k]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, the updated value of `dp[n, k]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
