The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary used to store intermediate results. 

In Case 1, if `k` equals 0, the function returns 0 without making any changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`.

In Case 2, if the tuple `(n, k)` is already present in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]` without making any changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`.

In Case 3, the function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, a positive integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp` to store intermediate results. Depending on the conditions mentioned in the cases, the function either returns 0, retrieves a value from the dictionary `dp`, or returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]`.
