Example Answer:
The value of `dp[(n, k)]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[(n, k)]` divided by `MOD`. The variables `n`, `k`, `dp`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n remains a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] updated, and i is equal to k - 1.
Output State: **n remains a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with dp[(n, k)] updated, and i is equal to k - 1**
