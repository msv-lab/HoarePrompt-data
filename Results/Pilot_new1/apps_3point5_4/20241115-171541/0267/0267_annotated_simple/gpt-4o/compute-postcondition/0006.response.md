Example Answer: 
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is the next value after `l`, and the condition states that `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, the output state is: total_sum is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l`.
Output State: **total_sum is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l`**
