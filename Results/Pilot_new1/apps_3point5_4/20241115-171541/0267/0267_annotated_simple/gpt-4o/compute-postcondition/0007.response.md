Postcondition: ***total_sum is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
