According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l`, `r`, and `num`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then total_sum is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `num` should be updated to the next value after `l` and `r` should remain unchanged.
State: **Output State: total_sum is an integer, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to the next value after `l`**
