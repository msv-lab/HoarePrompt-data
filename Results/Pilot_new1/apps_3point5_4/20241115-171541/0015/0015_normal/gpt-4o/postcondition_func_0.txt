The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it further checks if c is 0 and prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it verifies if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
