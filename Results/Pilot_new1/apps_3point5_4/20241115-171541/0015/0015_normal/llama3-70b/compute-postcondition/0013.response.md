Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, the program prints 'YES'. If `c` is not 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is false, the program prints 'NO'. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring appropriate output is provided based on the specified conditions.***
