Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is 0 and `a` equals `b`, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is 0 and `a` does not equal `b`, then 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is not 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is false, then 'NO' is printed. All variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain within the specified range after the execution of the if else block, covering all possible edge cases and conditions.***
