The function accepts three integers a, b, and c, and based on certain conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If b is equal to a, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to a, then if c is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If (b - a) is divisible by c with no remainder and the result of the division is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
