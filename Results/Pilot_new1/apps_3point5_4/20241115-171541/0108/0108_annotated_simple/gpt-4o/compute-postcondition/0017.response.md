Output State: **If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26. If `s` contains characters that do not match `target`, `i` will be less than the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` will be greater than the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26**
