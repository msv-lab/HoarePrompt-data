Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program iterates through the English alphabet and checks if each letter is present in the input string `s`. If a letter is found, it appends that letter to the result string `res` and replaces that letter in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. This process continues until all letters in the alphabet are processed. If at the end `res` contains all 26 letters in alphabetical order, it means that the input string `s` can be transformed into the English alphabet as a subsequence. In this case, it prints the result string `res`. Otherwise, if `res` does not contain all 26 letters, it prints -1.

The program correctly handles the given problem description and outputs the expected result based on the input. It covers all potential cases where the input string can or cannot be transformed into the English alphabet as a subsequence.
