According to the code, the loop will execute until all characters in the alphabet have been iterated over. At the end of the last iteration, res, s, and char are updated based on the conditions mentioned. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the alphabet after 'char' needs to be considered.
State: **res is updated based on the conditions, s is updated based on the conditions, char is the next character in the alphabet**
