Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'a' in the string `s` with the character that comes after 'a' in the ASCII table. The string `s` is updated accordingly. The initial values of `s`, `res`, and `char` are given as the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', 'aa', and 'a' respectively.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
