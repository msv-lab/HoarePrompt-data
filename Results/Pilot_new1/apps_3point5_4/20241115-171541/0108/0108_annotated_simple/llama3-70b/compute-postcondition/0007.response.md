Example Answer:
The value of `res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, so `res` now becomes 'aa'. The values of `s` and `char` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string with the first occurrence of 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
