According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is now the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet, `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, and `char` is the first letter in the alphabet. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is now the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet, `s` is missing at least one letter from the alphabet, `char` is the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`**
