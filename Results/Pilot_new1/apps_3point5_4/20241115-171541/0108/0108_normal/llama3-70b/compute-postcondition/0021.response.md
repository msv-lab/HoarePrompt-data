Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res`. The string `res` already contains all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`. After adding `char`, the new `res` will have all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`, plus the missing letter `char`.
Output State: **`res` contains all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`, plus the missing letter `char`**
