Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, and only the first occurrence is replaced. The `res` variable, which had `char` added to it, is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is in `s` with the first occurrence replaced by the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has `char` added to it.
Output State: **`char` is in `s` with the first occurrence replaced by the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` has `char` added to it**
