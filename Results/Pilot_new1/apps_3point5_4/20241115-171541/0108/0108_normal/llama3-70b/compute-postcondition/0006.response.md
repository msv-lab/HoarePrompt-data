According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. For the loop to execute one more time, the new `char` must be in the modified `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet**
