Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` will be the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order, `s` will be empty, and `char` will be the last letter in the alphabet. If `s` is missing any letters, the loop will terminate early, and `res` will be the concatenation of all characters in alphabetical order up to the missing letter(s), `s` will have the missing letters replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, and `char` will be the last letter processed before termination. In both cases, if len(res) == 26, the program prints `res` which contains all lowercase English letters in alphabetical order; otherwise, it prints -1.***
