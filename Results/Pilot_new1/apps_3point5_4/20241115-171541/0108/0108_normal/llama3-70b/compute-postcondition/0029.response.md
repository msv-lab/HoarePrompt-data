Example Answer:
Since `char` is in `s`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, `res` will have `char` added to it. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is in `s`; `res` has `char` added to it.
Output State: **`char` is in `s`; `res` has `char` added to it**
