Example Answer: 
The character `char` is added to the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but since we are adding a character to it, the resulting string will have an additional character. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, `res` is a string with an additional character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, `res` is a string with an additional character**
