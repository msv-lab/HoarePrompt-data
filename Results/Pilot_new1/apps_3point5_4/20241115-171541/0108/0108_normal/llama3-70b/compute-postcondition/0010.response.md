Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of `res`, so `res` is updated with an additional character. The value of `char` is the next letter in the alphabet compared to the last iteration, so `res` now contains one more character. The value of `s` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, `res` is a string with an additional character, and `char` is the next letter in the alphabet compared to the last iteration.
Output State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, `res` is a string with an additional character, and `char` is the next letter in the alphabet compared to the last iteration**
