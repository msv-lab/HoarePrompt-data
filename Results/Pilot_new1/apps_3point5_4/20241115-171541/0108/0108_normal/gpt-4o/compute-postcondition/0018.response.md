Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `target_len` is greater than 0. After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the number of characters in `target` that match with characters in `s` starting from the beginning of both strings, and `j` is equal to `target_len`.***
