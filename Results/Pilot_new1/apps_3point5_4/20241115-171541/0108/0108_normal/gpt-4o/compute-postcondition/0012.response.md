According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and `j` represents the index in `target`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1 and `j` needs to be increased by 1 as well. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of variable `target`, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is increased by 1**
