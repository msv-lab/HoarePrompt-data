The loop will execute as long as there is at least one occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`. The loop will replace each occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet and append the original `char` to the string `res`.

Output State: **If `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, `s` is a string with each occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with all the replaced characters. If `s` does not contain `char`, `s` remains unchanged, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the concatenation of all the replaced characters.**
