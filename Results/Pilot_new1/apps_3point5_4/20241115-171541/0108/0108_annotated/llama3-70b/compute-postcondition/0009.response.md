According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the character `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet once. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, the original `char` in `s` should be the character before the last character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the character before the last character in the alphabet replaced by the last character, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
