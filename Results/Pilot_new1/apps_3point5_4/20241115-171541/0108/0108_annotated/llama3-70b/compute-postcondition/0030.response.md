Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The variable `res` is updated with the replaced characters. After execution, the state is as follows: `s` has been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, and `char` is still in `s`.
Output State: **`s` has been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`**
