Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and the replacement is done only once. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `ord` and `chr` functions. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet with the first occurrence replaced, `res` is a string with all the replaced characters, `char` is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet with the first occurrence replaced, `res` is a string with all the replaced characters, `char` is appended to `res**.
