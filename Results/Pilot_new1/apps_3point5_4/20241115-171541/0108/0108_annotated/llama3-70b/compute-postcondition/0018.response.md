Example Answer:
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `s` is a string with each occurrence of the next character in the alphabet replaced by the subsequent character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with all the replaced characters, `char` is appended to `res`.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `s` is a string with each occurrence of the next character in the alphabet replaced by the subsequent character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with all the replaced characters, `char` is appended to `res`**
