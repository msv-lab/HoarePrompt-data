Output State: **If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in order, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26. If `s` runs out of characters before matching all of `target`, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `target` runs out of characters before `s`, `i` will be less than the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26. If both `s` and `target` run out of characters simultaneously, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `j` will be equal to 26.**
