Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program iterates through the English alphabet and replaces each character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet until the entire alphabet is formed as a subsequence. It then checks if the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the English alphabet) and prints the result or -1 accordingly. This logic covers all potential cases and ensures that the output string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence.
