Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer n and a list of n distinct integers.
- It correctly calculates the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the list.
- It then calculates the maximum distance of these elements from the start and end of the list and prints this maximum distance.
- The code handles the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the opposite ends of the array and no swap is needed.
- The logic in the code aligns with the problem description and all provided examples, ensuring that it covers all potential cases.
