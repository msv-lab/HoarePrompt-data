Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between the first occurrence of 1 and the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, then subtracts 1 from it. It also calculates the minimum distance between the first occurrence of 1 and the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, then subtracts 1 from it. The result is the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 or `n - 2`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 or `n - 2`, and the program prints the maximum value between the calculated distances.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 or `n - 2`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 or `n - 2`, and the program prints the maximum value between the calculated distances**
