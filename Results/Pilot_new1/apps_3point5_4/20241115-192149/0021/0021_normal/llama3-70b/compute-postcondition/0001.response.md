Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted to integers using `map` and `int`, then stored in list `a`. The value of `n` is used as an input for the list creation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**
