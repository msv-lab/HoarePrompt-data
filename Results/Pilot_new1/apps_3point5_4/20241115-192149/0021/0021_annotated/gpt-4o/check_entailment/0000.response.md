Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations state that the code calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 0 and `n-1` in the list `a`, but this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The code calculates the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the input list `a`, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping one element with either 1 or n to maximize this distance. This means that the code does not guarantee the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after exactly one swap.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
