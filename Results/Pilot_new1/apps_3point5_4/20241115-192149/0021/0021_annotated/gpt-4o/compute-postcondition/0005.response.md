Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`. The values of `n` and `max_pos` are known, so `dist2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n - 1 - (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `dist2 = abs(0) = 0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is `n-1`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is `n-1`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is 0**
