Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map`. The length of the list `a` is `n`, which is already known to be between 2 and 100. The integers in list `a` are distinct and range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**
