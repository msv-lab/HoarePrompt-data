Example Answer:
The maximum distance between pos1 and posn is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the positions and subtracting 1. If this value is less than n-2, then n-2 is taken as the maximum distance. The previous values of pos1 and posn are 0 and n-1 respectively. Therefore, the maximum distance is calculated as max(abs(0 - (n-1)) - 1, n - 2) which simplifies to max(n-1 - 1, n - 2) = max(n-2, n-2) = n-2. Hence, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0, posn is n-1, max_dist is n-2.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0, posn is n-1, max_dist is n-2**
