Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by considering the absolute difference between their positions and the size of the array. The logic used in the program is sound and ensures that the maximum distance is achieved by performing exactly one swap. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output for each scenario described in the problem statement.
