Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array. It then calculates the distance between these elements and the ends of the array. Finally, it determines the maximum distance possible and prints it. The logic provided in the code is sound and covers all potential cases, ensuring that the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements is achieved by performing exactly one swap.
