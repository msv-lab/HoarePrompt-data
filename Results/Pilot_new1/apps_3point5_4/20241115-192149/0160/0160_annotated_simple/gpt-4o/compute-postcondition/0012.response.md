Example Answer:
The code adds the result of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2 and the square root of `x` plus 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and the result of `x // i` is added to `divisors`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` up to 2 and the square root of `x` plus 1, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and the result of `x // i` is added to `divisors`**
