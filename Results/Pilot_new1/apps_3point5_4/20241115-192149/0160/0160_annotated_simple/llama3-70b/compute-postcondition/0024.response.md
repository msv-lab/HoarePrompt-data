According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`, `i` is 2. If gcd % i is 0, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by i. Otherwise, no changes occur in the variables. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value after 2.
State: **N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 3**
