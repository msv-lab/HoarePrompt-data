Postcondition: ***N is an integer. If N is 2 or greater, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A and i is 1. If N is less than 2, gcd is the initial value of A[0] and i is 1. In the if block, if gcd is divisible by i, max_divisor is updated to be the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i where the square of i is not equal to gcd. All edge cases are considered and covered in the postcondition.***
