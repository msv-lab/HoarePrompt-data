According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, N is already between 2 and 500, so no adjustment is needed for N. The loop starts from 1, so i will start from 1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to N, so the loop will execute N-1 times. In each iteration, gcd is assigned the value of A[i]. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the initial state should be:
State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, gcd is assigned the value of A[1], i is 1**
