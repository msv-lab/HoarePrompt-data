According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 3 and 500, `K` is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `gcd` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of the previous value of `gcd` and `A[i]`, `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **Output State: N is an integer between 3 and 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, gcd is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of the previous value of gcd and A[i], i is 3**
