Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, which is 1 in this case. Since `x` is divisible by `i`, the result of `x // i` will be an integer. This integer is then added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1, `x // i` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the value of `x` will be added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` will contain the value of `x`.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing the value of x, x is a non-negative integer, i is 1, x is divisible by i**
