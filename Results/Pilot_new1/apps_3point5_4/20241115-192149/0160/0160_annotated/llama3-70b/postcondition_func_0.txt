The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `K` from input, then reads a list of integers `A`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list `A` and finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
