Example Answer:
N and K are assigned values using map(int, input().split()), where N represents the number of elements and K represents a specific value. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of N and K are within the specified constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
