Example Answer:
The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` can be any non-negative integer between 0 and 8, the value of `x` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
