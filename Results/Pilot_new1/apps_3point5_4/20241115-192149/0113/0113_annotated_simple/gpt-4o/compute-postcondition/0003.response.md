The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of 'x' after performing certain calculations based on the values of `n` and `k`.
