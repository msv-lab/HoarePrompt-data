The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `k` is in the range [0, 8] and calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. It then increments `n` by the smallest positive value needed to make `n` divisible by `x`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `n`. If `n` is already divisible by `x`, no incrementation occurs.
