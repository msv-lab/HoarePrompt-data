According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more tuples in the `buses` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple (s, d), `min_time` and `ans` have been updated based on the conditions mentioned, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `buses` list needs to contain at least one more tuple. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 2 tuples (s, d), min_time and ans have been updated, i is 1, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, time is calculated as (t - s) % d**
