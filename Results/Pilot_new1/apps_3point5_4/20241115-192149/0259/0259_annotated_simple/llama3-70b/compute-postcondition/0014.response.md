Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` contains tuples (s, d) where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space. If n is less than 1 or greater than 100, the loop does not execute and buses remains an empty list. `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity. `ans` is assigned -1.**
