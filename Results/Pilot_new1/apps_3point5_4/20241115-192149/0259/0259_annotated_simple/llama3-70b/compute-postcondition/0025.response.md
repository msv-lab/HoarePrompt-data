Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 2 tuples (s, d), min_time has been updated with the calculated time. If the calculated time is less than the previous min_time, min_time is updated with the new time value, and ans is updated to i + 1. Otherwise, min_time and ans remain unchanged. i is 1, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, time is calculated as (t - s) % d, and ans is 2.***
