Example Answer:
A new tuple (s, d) is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained from splitting the input by space. The initial state includes `n` as a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` as a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, and `buses` containing tuples. After executing the code, a new tuple (s, d) is added to the list `buses`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5; `buses` contains tuples including the newly appended tuple (s, d)**
