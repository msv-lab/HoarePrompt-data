Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates through each bus route and calculates the minimum wait time for Serval based on the given conditions. It then selects the route with the minimum wait time as the chosen route. The logic in the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all possible cases where Serval might need to wait for a bus. The program also correctly determines the chosen route even if multiple buses arrive at the same time. Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the program is correct.
