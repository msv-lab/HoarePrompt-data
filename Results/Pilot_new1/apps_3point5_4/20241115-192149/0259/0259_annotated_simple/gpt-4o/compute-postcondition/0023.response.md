Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer updated based on the conditions provided; `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` where `i` is 1; `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This covers all possible scenarios for the calculation of `wait_time` based on the conditions provided, ensuring the program variables are correctly updated and the relationships between them are maintained.***
