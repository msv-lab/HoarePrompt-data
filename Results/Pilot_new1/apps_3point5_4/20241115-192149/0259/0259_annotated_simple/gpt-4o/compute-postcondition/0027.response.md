According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` where `i` is 1, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i]`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions provided, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 2`, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i + 1]`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i + 1]`.**
