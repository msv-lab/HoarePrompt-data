Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given time `t` and the intervals between buses.
3. The program correctly determines the chosen route for Serval based on the minimum wait time calculated for each route.
4. The output is the chosen route that Serval will use, which aligns with the problem description.
5. The program iterates through all bus routes and calculates the wait time for each route, ensuring that the chosen route will be the first bus Serval can take.
6. The program handles the case where multiple buses arrive at the same time by choosing any of them randomly, as specified in the problem description.
