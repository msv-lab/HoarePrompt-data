According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n` + 1. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is less than `n` + 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` + 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is less than `n` + 2, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces**
