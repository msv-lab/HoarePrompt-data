According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is less than `n`**
