According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` appended with the new tuple `(s, d)`, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` + 1.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` appended with the new tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is less than `n` + 1, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces**
