Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are obtained by splitting the input string by spaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is less than `n` + 1, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)` appended, `_` is less than `n` + 1, `s` and `d` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces**
