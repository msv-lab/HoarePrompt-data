Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum time calculated based on the formula `(t - s) % d`. `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, incremented by 1. `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 element. `i` is an integer initialized to 0. `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list. The variables are updated if the calculated `time` is less than the current `min_time`, with `min_time` being set to `time` and `ans` being set to `i + 1`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the given program fragment.***
