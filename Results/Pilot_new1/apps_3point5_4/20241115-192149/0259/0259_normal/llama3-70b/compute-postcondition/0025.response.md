Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum time which is updated to the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d` if `time` is less than the current `min_time`. `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time incremented by 1, and it is updated to `i + 1` if `time` is less than the current `min_time`. The list `buses` remains unchanged with at least 2 elements. `i` is an integer representing the index of the current bus. `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the list. The variable `time` is the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d`.***
