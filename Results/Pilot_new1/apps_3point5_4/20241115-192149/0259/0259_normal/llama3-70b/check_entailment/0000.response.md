Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input for the number of buses and the target time, then iterates through each bus's start and duration times to calculate the minimum time required to reach the destination considering multiple bus routes. 
- It then prints the index of the bus with the minimum time.
- The code correctly handles the scenario where Serval will choose the bus route with the minimum time to reach the destination.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly determines the bus route that Serval will use based on the provided input.
