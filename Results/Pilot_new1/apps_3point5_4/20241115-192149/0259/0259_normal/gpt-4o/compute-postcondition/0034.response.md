Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is set to the value of wait_time calculated based on the conditions provided in the program fragment, chosen_route is updated to i + 2 where i is the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. If s_i >= t, wait_time is calculated as s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is set to 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.**
