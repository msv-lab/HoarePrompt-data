Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately implements the problem description by taking the input values, calculating the wait time for Serval at each bus route, and determining the bus route with the minimum wait time.
- The function `func_1` correctly handles cases where Serval arrives before the first bus, when the wait time is 0, and when the wait time is based on the interval between buses.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
