Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route 1. If the condition (t - s_i) % d_i == 0 is true, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i based on the updated values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. This covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if-else block.***
