Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i]. If (t - s_i) % d_i is equal to 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i.***
