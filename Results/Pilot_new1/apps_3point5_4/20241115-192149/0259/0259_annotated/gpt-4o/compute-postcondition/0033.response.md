Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the updated minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[i]. If s_i is greater than or equal to t, `wait_time` is set to the difference between s_i and t. If (t - s_i) modulo d_i equals 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
