Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`, where `i` is 1. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the bus route information. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route 1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route 1**
