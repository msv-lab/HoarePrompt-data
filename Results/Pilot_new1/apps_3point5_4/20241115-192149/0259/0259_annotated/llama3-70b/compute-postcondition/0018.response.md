Output State: **`n` is incremented by the number of times the loop ran, `t` remains the same, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` with at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list, and `time` is the result of `(t - s) % d` where the `time` is less than `min_time`**
