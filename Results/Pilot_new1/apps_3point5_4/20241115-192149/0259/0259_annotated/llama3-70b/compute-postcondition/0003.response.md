Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `s` and `d` are determined by the user input. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting**
