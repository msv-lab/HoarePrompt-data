Example Answer:
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the input after splitting. The variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 2, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` with values assigned from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 2, `t` is a positive integer satisfying constraints, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` with values assigned from the input after splitting**
