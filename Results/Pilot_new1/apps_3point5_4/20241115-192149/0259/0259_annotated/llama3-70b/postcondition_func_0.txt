The function `func` reads input for the number of buses `n` and the target time `t`, then reads the start time `s` and the interval time `d` for each bus. It stores this information in a list of tuples called `buses`. After that, it calculates the minimum time for a bus to arrive at the target time and prints the index of the bus that arrives earliest. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
