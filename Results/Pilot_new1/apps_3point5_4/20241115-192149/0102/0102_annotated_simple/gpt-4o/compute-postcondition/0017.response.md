Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer where 0 <= s <= 99, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, and `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from zero to ninety. The integer `n` can be any value between 0 and 99. If `n` is in the range of 0 to 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones`. If `n` is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens`. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. For any other two-digit number, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given ranges of `n`, ensuring that the appropriate representations are returned based on the conditions met.***
