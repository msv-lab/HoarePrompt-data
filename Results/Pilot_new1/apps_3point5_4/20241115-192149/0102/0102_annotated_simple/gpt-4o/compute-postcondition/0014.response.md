Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer where 10 <= s <= 99, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from zero to ninety, and `n` is an integer between 10 and 99. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n`. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`. The postcondition covers all edge cases including n being a multiple of 10, n being in the teens range, and n being any other two-digit number.***
