Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It takes an integer input `s` and prints out the corresponding word representation of that number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word equivalent from the 'ones' array. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), it prints the word equivalent from the 'teens' array. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the concatenation of the word equivalent from the 'tens' array and the 'ones' array, separated by a hyphen if needed. The function covers the range of 0 to 99 for the input integer `s`.**
