Functionality: **The function `func` takes an integer input `s` from the user and prints the word representation of that number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word from the ones list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the teens list. For numbers between 20 and 99, it constructs the word representation using the ones, tens, and teens lists. The function does not return any value. The functionality covers all possible cases for the input integer `s`, including edge cases like 0, 9, 10, 19, 20, and 99.**
