Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly converts an integer score to its word representation as per the problem description. It uses lists for ones, teens, and tens to construct the word representation based on the input integer. The code covers all possible cases for the input integer `s`, including edge cases like 0, 9, 10, 19, 20, and 99. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description, and the output is as expected. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases.
