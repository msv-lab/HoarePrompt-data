Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones list is defined with words for numbers from zero to nine, teens list is defined with words for numbers from ten to nineteen, tens list is defined with words for multiples of ten from twenty to ninety. If s is less than 20, the code prints the word representation of s from the teens list. If s is greater than or equal to 20, the code prints the word representation of s by combining the word representation of the tens place from the tens list and the word representation of the ones place from the ones list with a hyphen if the ones place is not zero.***
