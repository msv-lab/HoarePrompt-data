Example Answer:
The code simply prints the value of `r`. Since the value of `r` is already defined as a positive integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, the output state remains unchanged.
Output State: **n, m, r are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; b is a list of integers obtained from input, min_buy_price is the minimum value in list b, max_sell_price is the maximum value in list b. The maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price**
