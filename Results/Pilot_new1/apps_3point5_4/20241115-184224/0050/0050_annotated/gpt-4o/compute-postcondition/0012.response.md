Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, the program calculates `max_shares` as the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then prints the value of `total_bourles`.***
