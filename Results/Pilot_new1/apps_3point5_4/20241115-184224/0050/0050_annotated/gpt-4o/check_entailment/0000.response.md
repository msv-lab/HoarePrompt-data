Correctness: True

Explanation: The code reads the input correctly and calculates the maximum profit that can be earned based on the buying and selling prices of shares. It considers the case where the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, and handles it by simply returning the initial investment `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total profit from selling those shares along with the remaining money. The code logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code.
