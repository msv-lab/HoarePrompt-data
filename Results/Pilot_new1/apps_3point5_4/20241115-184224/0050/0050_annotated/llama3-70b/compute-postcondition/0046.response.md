Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, then processes two lists `s` and `b` based on the input. It sorts the lists `s` and `b`, calculates the total number of shares based on the elements in `s` and `r`, updates `r` based on the shares and elements in `b`, and finally prints the value of `r`. The function does not accept any parameters and follows the constraints: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000.**
