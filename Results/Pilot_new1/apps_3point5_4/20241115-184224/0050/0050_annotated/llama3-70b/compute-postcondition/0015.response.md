Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by taking the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`, where `s[i]` is a value from the list `s`. The value of `r` is modified accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is updated by the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`, `shares` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is updated by the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`, `shares` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
