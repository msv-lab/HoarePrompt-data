According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Since `b` is sorted in reverse order, it does not affect the loop execution. The initial value of `shares` being 0 does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
