Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is an integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop.***
