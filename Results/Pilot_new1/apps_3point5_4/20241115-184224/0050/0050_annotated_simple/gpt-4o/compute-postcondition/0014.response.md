Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. Then, it prints the total amount of money. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
