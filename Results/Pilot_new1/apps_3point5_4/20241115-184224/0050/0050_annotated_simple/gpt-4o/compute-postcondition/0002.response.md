Example Answer: 
The code maps the input values to integers and stores them in a list `b`. The list `b` is now populated with integers obtained from input(). The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= n, m; s is a list of integers obtained from input(); b is a list of integers obtained from input().
Output State: **n, m, r are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. s_i and b_i are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000 for 1 <= i <= n, m; s is a list of integers obtained from input(); b is a list of integers obtained from input()**
