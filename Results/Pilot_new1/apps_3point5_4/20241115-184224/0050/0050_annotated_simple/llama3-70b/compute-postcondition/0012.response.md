Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain the same. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of the previous value of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop or if statement is exited.***
