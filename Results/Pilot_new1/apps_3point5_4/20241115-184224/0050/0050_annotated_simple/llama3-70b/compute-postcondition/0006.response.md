According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variables `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` are not directly related to the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain the same**
