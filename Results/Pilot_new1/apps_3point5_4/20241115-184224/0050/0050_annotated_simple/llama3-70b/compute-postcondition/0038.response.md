Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]` to it. The value of `shares` is reset to 0 after the calculation. The condition is that `i` should be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `n` are greater than 0, `r` is updated if shares is greater than 0 by adding the product of shares and b[i] to r, `shares` is reset to 0, `s` remains a list with elements, `i` is less than `m + 1.
Output State: **`m`, `n` are greater than 0, `r` is updated if shares is greater than 0 by adding the product of shares and b[i] to r, `shares` is reset to 0, `s` remains a list with elements, `i` is less than `m + 1**
