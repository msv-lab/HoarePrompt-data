According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `shares` and `b[i]`, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 as the loop is moving to the next iteration.
- If `shares` is greater than 0, it should be reset to 0 as mentioned in the description.
- `r` should be updated based on the new values of `shares` and `b[i]` for the next iteration.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `shares` and `b[i]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 0**
