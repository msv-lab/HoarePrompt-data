Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, list `b` is sorted in reverse order. If r >= s[i], `shares` is increased by the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], the loop breaks.***
