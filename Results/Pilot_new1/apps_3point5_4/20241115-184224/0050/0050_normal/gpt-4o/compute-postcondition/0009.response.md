Example Answer:
The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. The previous values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are known, so the value of `remaining_bourles` can be calculated. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_shares` is the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`.**
