Example Answer:
p_shared is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD. The previous values of p_total, p_no_shared, and MOD are unknown. If k is 0 or lower, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator, which is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1. If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is already calculated as the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, p_no_shared is either 1 or the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, and p_shared is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, p_no_shared is either 1 or the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, and p_shared is calculated based on the formula**
