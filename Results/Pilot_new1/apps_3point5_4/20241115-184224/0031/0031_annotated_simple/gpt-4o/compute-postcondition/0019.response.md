Output State: **numerator is the product of all (total_days - i) modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1, denominator is the product of all total_days modulo MOD where i ranges from 0 to k-1. If k is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and numerator remains 1, denominator remains 1. p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator.**
