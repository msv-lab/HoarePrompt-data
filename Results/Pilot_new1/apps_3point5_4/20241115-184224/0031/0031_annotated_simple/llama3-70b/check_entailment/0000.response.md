Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday among a group of k people in a year with 2^n days.
2. The loop iterates through k and calculates the numerator as the product of (total_days - i) for each i, and the denominator as total_days raised to the power of k.
3. The program then calculates the gcd of numerator and denominator, divides both by the gcd to ensure they are coprime, and returns the remainders of numerator and denominator modulo (10^6 + 3).
4. The program follows the problem description and handles the given input constraints, providing the probability in the required form.
