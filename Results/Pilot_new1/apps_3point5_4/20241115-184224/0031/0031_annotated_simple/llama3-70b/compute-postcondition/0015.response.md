Example Answer:
`numerator` is divided by `gcd`. The value of `numerator` is the product of (total_days - k) to (total_days - 1), and `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, and `k` and `n` are integers. After dividing `numerator` by `gcd`, the state of `numerator` changes. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of (total_days - k) to (total_days - 1) divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of (total_days - k) to (total_days - 1) divided by `gcd`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `k` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator**.
