Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the total number of days in Udayland based on the input values of n.
2. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday among k people.
3. The program uses the math.gcd function to find the greatest common divisor and ensures that A and B are coprime before taking their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3.
4. The program outputs A and B in a single line as required by the problem description.
5. The program handles large input values for n and k as specified in the problem description.
6. The program uses integer division to avoid floating-point arithmetic and ensures that the output is an irreducible fraction.
