According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, `numerator` is the result of the calculation, `denominator` is the updated value after multiplying by `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`, total_days is 1, `i` is 1, `numerator` is updated by multiplying with `(total_days - i)` and taking the modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is updated by multiplying with `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, if `k` is greater than 0, `numerator` is the result of the calculation, `denominator` is the updated value after multiplying by `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`, `total_days` is 1, `i` is 2, `numerator` is updated by multiplying with `(total_days - i)` and taking the modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is updated by multiplying with `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD**`
