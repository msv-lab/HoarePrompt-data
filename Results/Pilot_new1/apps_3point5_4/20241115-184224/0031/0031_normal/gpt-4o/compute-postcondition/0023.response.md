Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, which is equal to `denominator`. Therefore, after execution, `B` is equal to `denominator`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`p_total` is equal to `denominator`, `p_shared` is updated based on the calculation, `A` is equal to `p_shared`, `B` is equal to `denominator`**
