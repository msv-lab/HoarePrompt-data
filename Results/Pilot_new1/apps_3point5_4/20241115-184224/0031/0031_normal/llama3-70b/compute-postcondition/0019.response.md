Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the total days as 2 raised to the power of `n`, then iterates `k` times updating the `numerator` and `denominator` values accordingly. After the loop, it calculates the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, divides both by this value, and returns the remainders of the division of `numerator` and `denominator` by (10^6 + 3).**
