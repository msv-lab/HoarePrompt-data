The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of the division of `n` by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of the division of `k` by (10^6 + 3). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the remainders of their divisions by (10^6 + 3).
