Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It does this by calculating the numerator as the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1, and the denominator as the product of total_days for i from 0 to k-1. It then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form and takes the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3. The program handles large numbers efficiently by performing the calculations modulo 10^6 + 3. Since the logic aligns with the problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned where the program fails, we can conclude that the program is correct.
