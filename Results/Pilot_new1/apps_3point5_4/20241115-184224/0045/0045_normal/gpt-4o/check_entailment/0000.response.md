Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- If the calculated sum is greater than `n`, the function returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- If the sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates the value `d = n // min_sum` and the remainder `remainder = n - d * min_sum`.
- It then constructs a sequence list by multiplying each element by `d` and then adjusting the values based on the remainder to maximize the greatest common divisor.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides a valid output for each case.
