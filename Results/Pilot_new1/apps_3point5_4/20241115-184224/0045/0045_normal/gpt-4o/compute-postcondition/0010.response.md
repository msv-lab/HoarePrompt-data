Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is greater than 0, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[(d * 1), (d * 2), ..., (d * k)]`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`, and if `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The overall state of the program after the if statement executes covers all edge cases related to the values of `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`, `k`, and `i`.***
