Output State: **If `remainder` is 0 at the beginning, the loop does not execute and the `sequence` remains the same. If `remainder` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and decrement the `remainder` until it reaches 0. The `sequence` list will have some elements incremented by 1 based on the value of `remainder`.**
