According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1, so `min_sum` is greater than 0. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, so `k` should be adjusted to be greater than 0. Since the loop starts at `k - 1`, `i` should be set to `k - 1` at the beginning. 
State: **`min_sum` is greater than 0, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[(d * 1), (d * 2), ..., (d * k)]`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k - 1`**
