Example Answer:
The value of `min_sum` is calculated by multiplying `k` with the sum of the first `k` positive integers. Since `k` is a positive integer, the value of `min_sum` is determined accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1**
