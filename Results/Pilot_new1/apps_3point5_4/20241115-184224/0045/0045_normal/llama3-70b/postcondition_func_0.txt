The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b. The function calculates the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm by iteratively updating the values of a and b until b becomes 0. If a is less than b initially, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the initial value of a.
