The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b.**
