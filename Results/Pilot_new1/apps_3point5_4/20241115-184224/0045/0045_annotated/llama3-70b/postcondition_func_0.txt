The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. It then iteratively updates the values of `a` and `b` according to a specific formula until `b` becomes 0. If `b` is non-zero, the function updates `a` and `b` accordingly. If `b` is 0, the function returns the value of `a`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` is 0 explicitly, which might lead to unexpected behavior in those cases.
