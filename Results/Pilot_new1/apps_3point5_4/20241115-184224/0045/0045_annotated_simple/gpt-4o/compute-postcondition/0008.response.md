Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `n` is the input number, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)`, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is greater than 0, and `remainder` is equal to 0***
