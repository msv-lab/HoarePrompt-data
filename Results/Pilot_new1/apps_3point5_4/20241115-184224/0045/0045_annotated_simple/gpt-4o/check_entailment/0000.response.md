Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum that can be obtained by using the first `k` positive integers.
2. If the minimum sum is greater than `n`, the program returns -1, which is correct according to the problem description.
3. The program then calculates the value of `d` which is the number of times the minimum sum can be added to get `n`.
4. It then calculates the remainder after subtracting `d * min_sum` from `n`.
5. The program constructs a sequence of `k` positive numbers where each element is a multiple of `d` and strictly increasing.
6. It then adjusts the sequence by incrementing certain elements by 1 to account for the remainder.
7. The final sequence is returned as the output.
8. The program covers all possible cases as per the problem description and provides the correct output.
