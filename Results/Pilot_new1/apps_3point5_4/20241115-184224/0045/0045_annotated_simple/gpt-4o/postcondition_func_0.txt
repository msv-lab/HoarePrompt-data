The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers and compares it to `n`. If the sum is greater than `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it generates a sequence by distributing the remainder of `n` after dividing by the sum among the elements of the sequence. The function then returns this sequence.
