Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros. If `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`. The integer value of `a` is less than the integer value of `b`***
