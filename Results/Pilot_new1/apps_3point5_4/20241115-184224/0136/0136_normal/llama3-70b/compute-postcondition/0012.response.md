Functionality: **The function `func` takes no parameters and internally reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings with up to 10^6 digits. It then compares the values of `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The function successfully executes the comparison and output operation based on the relationship between `a` and `b**'.
