Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers as strings, trims leading zeros, compares their numerical values, and prints '<' if the first integer is less than the second, '>', if the first integer is greater than the second, and '=' if they are equal. The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles cases where one number has leading zeros, trims those zeros, and compares the numerical values of the integers. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear understanding of the expected behavior. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
