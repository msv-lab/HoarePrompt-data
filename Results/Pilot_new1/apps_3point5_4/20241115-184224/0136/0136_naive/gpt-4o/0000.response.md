Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two integers a and b from input and removes any leading zeroes.
2. It then compares the lengths of a and b. If the lengths are not equal, it directly prints the result based on length.
3. If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of a and b. If a is less than b, it prints "<", if a is greater than b, it prints ">", and if they are equal, it prints "=".
4. The program handles the case where both a and b are '0' by assigning them the value '0'.
5. The program correctly handles the comparison of a and b for all potential cases and outputs the correct result.
