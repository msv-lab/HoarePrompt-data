Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. The function handles cases where `a` or `b` are '0' or empty strings appropriately. The function does not return the sum of `a` and `b` as the annotations suggest, but instead performs a comparison between the two values.**
