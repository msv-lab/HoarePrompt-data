Example Answer:
The value of `b` is updated by removing any leading zeros from the second element of the `data` list. If `b` originally had leading zeros, they are now removed. The state of variable `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
