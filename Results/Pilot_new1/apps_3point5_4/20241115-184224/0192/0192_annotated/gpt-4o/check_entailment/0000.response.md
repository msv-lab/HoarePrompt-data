Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads two integers `x` and `y`, calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from the equilateral triangle of side length `x`, and prints the result. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` accurately determines the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to reach the desired triangle side length. The provided examples in the problem description align with the output of the code, confirming its correctness. Additionally, the annotations do not suggest any cases where the code might fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.
