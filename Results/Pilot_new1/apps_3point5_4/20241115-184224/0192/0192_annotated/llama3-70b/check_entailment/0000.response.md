Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers, which is not the correct logic to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. The code does not consider the specific operations required to transform the equilateral triangle from side length x to side length y.

An example where the code does not work correctly:
Input: 6 3
Expected Output: 4
Explanation: The correct sequence of operations should be: (6,6,6) -> (6,6,3) -> (6,4,3) -> (3,4,3) -> (3,3,3). However, the code provided does not perform these operations and simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
