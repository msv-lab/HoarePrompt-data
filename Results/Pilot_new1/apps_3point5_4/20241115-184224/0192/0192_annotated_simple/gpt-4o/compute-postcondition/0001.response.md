Example Answer:
The expression calculates the result of ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2). Given that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is always 1.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the result of the expression is always 1**
