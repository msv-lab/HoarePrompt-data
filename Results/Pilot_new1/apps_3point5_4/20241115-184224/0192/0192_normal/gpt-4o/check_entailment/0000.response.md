Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, calculates the difference between them, then returns half of the difference plus the remainder of the difference divided by 2. This logic aligns with the problem description of Memory modifying the length of a single side of the current triangle in a non-degenerate way to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. The examples provided in the problem description are covered by the code, and it seems to handle all potential cases correctly. The output hints also agree with the code's functionality.
