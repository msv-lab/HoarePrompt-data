Example Answer: 
`x` and `y` are assigned the values of integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `x` and `y` are constrained by the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
