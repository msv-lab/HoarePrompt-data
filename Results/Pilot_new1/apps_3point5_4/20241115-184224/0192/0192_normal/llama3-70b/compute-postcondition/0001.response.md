Example Answer: 
The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs()` function and then prints the result. Since the initial state specifies that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the absolute difference between any two such integers will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed**
