Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the remainder of n when divided by 10 and then rounds n to the nearest integer ending with 0. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from n to get the rounded number. If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to n to get the rounded number. The program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output.
