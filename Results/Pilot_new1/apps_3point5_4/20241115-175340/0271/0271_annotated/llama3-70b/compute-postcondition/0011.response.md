Functionality: **The function reads a non-negative integer input n, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and based on the value of n, it prints a modified version of n. If n is divisible by 10, it prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, it adjusts n to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the remainder of n divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it prints n minus the remainder; otherwise, it prints n plus the difference between 10 and the remainder.**
