Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is between 6 and 9. The value of `result` depends on the values of `n` and `remainder`. The output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 6 and 9, and result is the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 6 and 9, result is the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder**.
