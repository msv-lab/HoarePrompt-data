Example Answer:
If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` will be the difference between `n` and `remainder`. If `remainder` is between 6 and 9, `result` will be the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `n` and `remainder`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is between 0 and 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is between 0 and 9**
