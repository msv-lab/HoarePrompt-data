Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the possible values for `remainder` are between 0 and 9. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9**
