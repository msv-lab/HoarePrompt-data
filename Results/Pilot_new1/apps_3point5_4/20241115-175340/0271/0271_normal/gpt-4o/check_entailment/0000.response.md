Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer input `n` and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Based on the value of the remainder, it adjusts `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 and prints the result. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. For example, if `n = 5`, the nearest integers that end up with zero are 0 and 10. The code handles this case by rounding `n` to 0. Similarly, for other inputs like `113`, `1000000000`, and `5432359`, the code correctly rounds `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0.
