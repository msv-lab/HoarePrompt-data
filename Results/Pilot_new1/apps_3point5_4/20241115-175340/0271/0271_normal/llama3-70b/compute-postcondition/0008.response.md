Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10. If the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5, the code prints n minus the last digit of n. If the last digit of n is greater than 5, the code prints n plus the difference between 10 and the last digit of n.***
