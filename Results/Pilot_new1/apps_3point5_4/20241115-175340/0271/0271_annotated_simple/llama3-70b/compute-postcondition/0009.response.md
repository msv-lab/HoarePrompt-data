Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is divisible by 10, the program prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the program prints either `n - n % 10` if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, or `n + (10 - n % 10)` if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5. In all cases, the final output is a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`.***
