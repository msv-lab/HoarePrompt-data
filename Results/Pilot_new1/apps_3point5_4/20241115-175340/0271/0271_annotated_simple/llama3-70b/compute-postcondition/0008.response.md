Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is not divisible by 10. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints `n - n % 10`. If the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5, the program prints `n + (10 - n % 10)`, ensuring that the final result is a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`.***
