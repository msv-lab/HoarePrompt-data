Example Answer:
The code calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, where `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10, and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is larger than 5. The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` effectively rounds up `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is not divisible by 10. The result of the expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` is a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is not divisible by 10. The result is a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`**
