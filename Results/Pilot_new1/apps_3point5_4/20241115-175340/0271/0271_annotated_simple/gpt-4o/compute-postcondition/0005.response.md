Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is between 6 and 9, the value of `result` will be affected accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 6 and 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`)**
