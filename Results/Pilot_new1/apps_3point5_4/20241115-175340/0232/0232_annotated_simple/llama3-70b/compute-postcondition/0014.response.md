Example Answer: 
`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0 for the specified color. The previous state of `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts for the specified color. After execution, the count for the specified color is set to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list with at least 3 colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts for the specified color where the count for the specified color is set to 0.
Output State: **`colors` is a list with at least 3 colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts for the specified color where the count for the specified color is set to 0**
