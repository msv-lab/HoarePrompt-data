Postcondition: ***After executing the code, the `window_counts` dictionary will have an incremented value for the `color` key if all counts in the `window_counts` dictionary match the corresponding targets in the `counts` list. The variable `found` will be True in this case, and the program will break out of the loop or if statement. All other variables and states will remain unchanged. If the condition is not met, no changes will be made to the `window_counts` dictionary, and `found` will remain False.***
