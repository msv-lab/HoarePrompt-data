According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `colors` list. If the list has more colors, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the `colors` list has at least 1 color. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `colors` list must have at least 2 colors.
State: **`colors` list has at least 2 colors, `color_counts` is updated accordingly**
