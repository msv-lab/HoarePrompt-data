Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, a new key-value pair is added with the color and a value of 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` list has at least 1 color, `color_counts` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`colors` list has at least 1 color, `color_counts` is updated accordingly**
