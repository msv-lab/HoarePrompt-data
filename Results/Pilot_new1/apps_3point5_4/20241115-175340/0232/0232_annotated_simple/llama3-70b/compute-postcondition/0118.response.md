Postcondition: ***After the if block executes, if `found` is True, then `found` remains True, `i` remains 2, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary where all counts are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts`, `color` is in `window_counts` with an incremented count, `j` is at least `n`, `color` is updated to `colors[j]`, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting. If the loop does not execute, the initial state variables remain unchanged.***
