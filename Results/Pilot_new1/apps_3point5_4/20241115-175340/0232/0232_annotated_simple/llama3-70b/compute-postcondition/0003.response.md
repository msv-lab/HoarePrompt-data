Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `colors` is a list containing the integers obtained from the input split, `counts` is a list of integers, and `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`colors` is a list containing the integers obtained from the input split, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
