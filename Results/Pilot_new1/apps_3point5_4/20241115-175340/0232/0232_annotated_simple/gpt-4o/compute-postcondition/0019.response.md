Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The specific values of `current_counts` and `colors` are not provided, so the output state is: No specific changes in the variables are mentioned, `right` is less than `n`.
Output State: **No specific changes in the variables are mentioned, `right` is less than `n`**
