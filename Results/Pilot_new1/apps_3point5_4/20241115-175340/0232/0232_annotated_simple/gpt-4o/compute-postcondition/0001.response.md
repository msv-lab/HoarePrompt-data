Example Answer:
`current_counts` is assigned a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in list `k`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in list `k`; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0**
