Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values initialized to 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0 and there exists at least one color where the value in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the values in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program does not alter the state of the variables and no action is taken.***
