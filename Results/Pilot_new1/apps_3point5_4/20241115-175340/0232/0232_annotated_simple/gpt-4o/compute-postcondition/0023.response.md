The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. 

**Precondition**: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers such that $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n**.

After executing the function body, the function operates in two cases:

Case_1: The loop continues until all colors in `current_counts` have counts greater than or equal to the corresponding values in `desired_counts`. If this condition is met, the function returns 'YES'. The values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged after each iteration of the loop.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`, and return 'YES' if all colors in `current_counts` have counts greater than or equal to the corresponding values in `desired_counts`. If this condition is not met, the function returns 'NO'.
