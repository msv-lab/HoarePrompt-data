Postcondition: ***colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer. color is the color at index j in the list where j is equal to i+2. color_counts and window_counts are updated accordingly, and window_counts[color] is incremented by 1 or initialized to 1 if it was not present. If all counts in the sorted values of window_counts are equal to the corresponding counts in counts, then found is True and the loop breaks. This postcondition covers the scenario where the conditions are met for the if statement, ensuring that the program state is maintained with the specified variable relationships and values.***
