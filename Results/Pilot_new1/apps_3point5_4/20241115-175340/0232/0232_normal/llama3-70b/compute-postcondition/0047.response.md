Postcondition: ***colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer. color is the color at index i+2 in the list. color_counts has color assigned the value 1 if not present. window_counts is a dictionary where color is assigned the value 1 if not present, j is i+2. n is greater than i+1. found is True. If all counts in sorted window_counts values are equal to the corresponding counts in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state unchanged.***
