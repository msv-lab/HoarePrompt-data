Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`. If `found` is True, the loop breaks. In this case, `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, `n` remains the same, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key and its value is the count of that color, `j` is equal to the current value of `i` in each iteration, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]` in each iteration. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0 and then incremented by 1. The values in `window_counts` are sorted and compared to the `counts` list. If all the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, the condition is true. If the loop does not execute (if `i` is already greater than or equal to `n`), `found` remains False, `i` stops incrementing, `n` remains the same, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.***
