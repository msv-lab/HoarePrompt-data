Output State: **If the colors list is empty, the loop does not execute. If the colors list is not empty, the loop iterates through the colors list from index i to n-1. For each color, the window_counts dictionary is updated to keep track of the count of color occurrences. If all the counts of colors in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks. After the loop, colors list is not empty, found is either True or False, color_counts contains the count of each color in the colors list, window_counts is a dictionary with the count of color occurrences, i is less than or equal to n, color is assigned the value at index j in the colors list, and all values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts.**
