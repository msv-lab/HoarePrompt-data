Postcondition: ***The `colors` list is not empty, `found` is True, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color in the `colors` list, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the count of colors that were not previously in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. After the execution of the if statement, if the color assigned to `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, a key-value pair is added to `window_counts` where the key is the color and the value is 0. Additionally, all the values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If the color was not in `window_counts`, then the key-value pair is added with the color and value 0.***
