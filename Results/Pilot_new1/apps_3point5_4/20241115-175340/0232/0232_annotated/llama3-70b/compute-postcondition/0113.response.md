Postcondition: ***colors list is not empty. If all the counts of colors in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is set to 0. If color is already in window_counts, the count of that color in window_counts is incremented by 1. The values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts.***
