Output State: **If all values in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts` for every color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop continues decrementing `current_counts[colors[left]]` and incrementing `left`. The loop will terminate when there is at least one color where the value in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`. This ensures that the code handles the scenario where the counts for all colors match the desired counts as well as when there is a mismatch for at least one color.**
