Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to their respective values in list k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict object with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. If all values in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts` for every color in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program continues with the next part of the code.***
