Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. It generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring and checks if the remembered substring is present in the generated number. It then selects the smallest possible number from the valid candidates. The logic seems sound and covers all potential cases.
