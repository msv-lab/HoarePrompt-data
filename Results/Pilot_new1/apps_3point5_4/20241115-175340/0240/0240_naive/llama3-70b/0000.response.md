Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input string and the remembered substring. It then iterates through the input string, keeping only the characters that are in the remembered substring. After that, it appends the remembered substring to the filtered input string and converts the result to an integer. This logic satisfies the problem description and will result in the smallest possible initial integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate. The program works correctly for all potential cases and examples provided.
