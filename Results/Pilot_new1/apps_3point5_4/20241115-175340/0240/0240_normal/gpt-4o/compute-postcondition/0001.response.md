Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be a string representing the first permutation of `chars`. The value of `sub` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is not empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is not empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of `chars`**
