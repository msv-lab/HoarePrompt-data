Output State: 
- `chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate.
- `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`.
- `perm` is the current permutation of `chars` being processed in the loop.
- `candidate` is a string representing the current permutation of `chars` being evaluated.
- If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`.
- If `candidate` is not a valid number with respect to `sub`, no action is taken.
- If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no values are yielded.
