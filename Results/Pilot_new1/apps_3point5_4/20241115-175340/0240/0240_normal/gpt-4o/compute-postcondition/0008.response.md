Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number`, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
