Example Answer:
The function yields the value of `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`, which is already assigned to `perm`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is not empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of `chars`, and the `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number`, and the function yields `candidate`.
Output State: **`chars` is not empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the first permutation of `chars`, and the `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number`, and the function yields `candidate`**
