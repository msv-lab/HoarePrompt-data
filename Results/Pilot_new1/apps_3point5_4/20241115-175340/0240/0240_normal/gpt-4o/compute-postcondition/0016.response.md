Functionality: ** The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, and `sub`, a string representing a substring of `n`. The function iterates through all permutations of `chars` and checks if each permutation forms a valid number with respect to `sub`. If a valid number is found, it yields that number. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute. The function does not have a specified return value. **
