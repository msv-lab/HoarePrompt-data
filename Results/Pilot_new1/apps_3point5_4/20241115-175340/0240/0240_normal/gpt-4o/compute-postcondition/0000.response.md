According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `n`. If `chars` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `chars` being a string of digits received by Kate does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `chars` is not empty and `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is not empty, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`**
