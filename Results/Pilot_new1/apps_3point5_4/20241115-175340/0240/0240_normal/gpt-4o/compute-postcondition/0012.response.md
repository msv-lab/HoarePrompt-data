Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
