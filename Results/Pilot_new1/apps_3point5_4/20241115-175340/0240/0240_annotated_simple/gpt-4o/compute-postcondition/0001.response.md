Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The value of `perm` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string representing a number, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string that is the result of joining `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a number, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string that is the result of joining `perm`**
