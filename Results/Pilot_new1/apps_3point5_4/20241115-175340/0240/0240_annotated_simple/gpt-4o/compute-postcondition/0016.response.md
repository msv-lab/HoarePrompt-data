Functionality: ** The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a non-empty string representing a number, and `sub`, a substring of `chars`. It generates permutations of the characters in `chars`, forms a candidate by joining these permutations, and yields the candidate if it passes the validity check with respect to `sub` using the `is_valid_number` function. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a substring of `chars`, the function does not execute the loop. The function does not return a specific output.**
