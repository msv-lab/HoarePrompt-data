Correctness: **True**

The program consists of three functions:
1. `func_1`: This function calculates the smallest possible initial integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate based on the received string and the remembered substring. It generates all possible numbers from the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring and returns the smallest number.
2. `is_valid_number`: This function checks if a given number string is valid by verifying if the remembered substring is present in the number and the length of the number is correct.
3. `generate_possible_numbers`: This function generates all possible numbers by permuting the remaining characters after removing the remembered substring and checks if the generated number is valid using the `is_valid_number` function.

The program logic seems correct as it follows the problem description by finding the smallest possible initial integer `n` that Vasya could pass to Kate. The functions are appropriately defined and work together to achieve the desired result. The annotations also provide clarity on the purpose of each function and the state of the program at various points.

Since the program logic aligns with the problem description and there are no apparent issues, the correctness of the program is **True**.
