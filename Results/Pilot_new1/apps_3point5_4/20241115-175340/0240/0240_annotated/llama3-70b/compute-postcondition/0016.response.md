The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. Both `s` and `t` are strings representing very large integers, where `t` is a substring of `s`. Both `s` and `t` can contain leading zeroes. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the integer representation of the concatenated characters from `s` that are present in `t`, or 0 if `t` is not a substring of `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return the integer representation of the concatenated characters from `s` that are present in `t`, or 0 if `t` is not a substring of `s`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters s and t, returns the integer representation of the concatenated characters from s that are present in t, or 0 if t is not a substring of s.**
