According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. The loop will iterate through each character in `s`. Before the loop starts, the string `s` should not be empty to allow the loop to execute. Additionally, since `t` is a substring of `s`, it should be a valid substring within `s`. The set `t_set` containing unique characters from `t` should also be adjusted to contain the unique characters from the substring `t` within `s`. Lastly, since `n` is an empty string, it does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **s is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, t is a valid substring of s, t_set contains unique characters from t**
