Example Answer:
If t is a substring of s, the loop will iterate over each character in s, incrementing n by the value of the character if it is in t_set. Therefore, after the loop executes, n will contain the concatenation of characters from s that are present in t_set. The value of n will depend on the characters in s that are present in t_set. If t is not a substring of s, n will remain an empty string.
Output State: **If t is a substring of s, n will contain the concatenation of characters from s that are present in t_set. If t is not a substring of s, n will remain an empty string.**
