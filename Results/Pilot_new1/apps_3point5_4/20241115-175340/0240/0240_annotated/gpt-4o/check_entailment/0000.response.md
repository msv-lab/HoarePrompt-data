Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided consists of three functions: `func_1`, `is_valid_number`, and `generate_possible_numbers`. 

1. `func_1` takes a string `s` and a substring `sub`, updates the character count in `s`, generates all possible numbers from the remaining characters, and returns the smallest valid number. This aligns with the problem description as it finds the smallest possible initial integer `n`.

2. `is_valid_number` checks if a given number string contains the substring `sub` and has the correct length. This function is used within `generate_possible_numbers` to validate candidate numbers, ensuring they meet the criteria specified in the problem description.

3. `generate_possible_numbers` generates all permutations of the remaining characters after subtracting the `sub` characters, constructs candidate numbers from these permutations, and yields valid candidates. This function ensures that only valid numbers are considered, consistent with the problem requirements.

The annotations provide insights into the state of the program and the logic behind each function, helping to understand how the code processes the input data. Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and handles the scenario of finding the smallest possible integer `n` based on the shuffled string and remembered substring.
