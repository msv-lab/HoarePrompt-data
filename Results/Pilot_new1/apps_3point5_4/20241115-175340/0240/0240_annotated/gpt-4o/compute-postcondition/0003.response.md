Example Answer:
The function yields the value of `candidate`, which is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`. The `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` as a substring. The initial state does not change after the yield statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`, and the function yields the first valid candidate number.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the first permutation of the string represented by `chars`, and the function yields the first valid candidate number**
