Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `chars` has less than 2 characters or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the loop does not execute.**
