Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, containing only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is broken. This condition covers all possible cases and edge cases of the program fragment.***
