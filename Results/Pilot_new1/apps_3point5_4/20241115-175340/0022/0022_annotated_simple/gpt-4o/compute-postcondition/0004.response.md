Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in the string `s` are not equal, resulting in the function returning False.***
