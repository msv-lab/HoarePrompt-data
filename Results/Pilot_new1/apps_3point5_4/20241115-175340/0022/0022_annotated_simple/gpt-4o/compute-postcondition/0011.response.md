According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than half the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` + 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and the condition `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]` should not be met. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` + 2**
