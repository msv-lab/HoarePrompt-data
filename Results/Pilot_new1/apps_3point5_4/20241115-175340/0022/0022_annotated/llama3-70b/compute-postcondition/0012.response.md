According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `(n // 2) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `(n // 2) + 1`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `(n // 2) + 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to (n // 2) + 1**
