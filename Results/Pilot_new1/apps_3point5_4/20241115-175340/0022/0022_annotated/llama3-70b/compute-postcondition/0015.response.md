Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to (n // 2) + 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. This condition covers all possible edge cases where the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` do not match, ensuring the palindrome property is maintained.***
