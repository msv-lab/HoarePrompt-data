Example Answer: 
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. Since the value is directly assigned without any calculations or conditions, the value remains `True`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of string `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True**
