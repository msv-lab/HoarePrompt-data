According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **s is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is 2**
