Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the logic to determine if a given string is an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` compares symmetric positions in the string and returns False if they are not equal. If the length of the string is less than 2, it returns True by default. The code loops through the string and checks if the characters at symmetric positions are equal. This logic aligns with the problem description, and the code is handling all potential cases where a string could be considered an "s-palindrome". The output hints also confirm that the code is following the problem description accurately.
