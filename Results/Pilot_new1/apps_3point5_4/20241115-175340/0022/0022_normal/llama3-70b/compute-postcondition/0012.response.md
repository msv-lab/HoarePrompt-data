According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is between 0 and n // 2. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is between 0 and n // 2 + 1**
