Functionality: **The function reads a string `s` from input, calculates its length `n`, and checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string. If the characters do not match at any point, the function sets `is_spalindrome` to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not handle cases where the input is empty or has a length less than 2.**
