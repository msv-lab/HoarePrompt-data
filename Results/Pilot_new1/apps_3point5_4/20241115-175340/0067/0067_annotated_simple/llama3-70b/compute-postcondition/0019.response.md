Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integer inputs and based on their values, it prints different characters ('+', '-', '0', or '?'). If the first input is greater than the sum of the second and third inputs, it prints '+'. If the first input is less than the second input, it prints '-'. If the first input is equal to the second input and the third input is 0, it prints '0'. If the first input is equal to the second input and the third input is not 0, it prints '?'. If the first input is not equal to the second input, it always prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
