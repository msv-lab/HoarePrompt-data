Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained by mapping integers from the input split by spaces. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers**
