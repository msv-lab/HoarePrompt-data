The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the input. It then calculates `min_upvotes` as `x`, `max_upvotes` as the sum of `x` and `z`, `min_downvotes` as `y`, and `max_downvotes` as the sum of `y` and `z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, it prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
