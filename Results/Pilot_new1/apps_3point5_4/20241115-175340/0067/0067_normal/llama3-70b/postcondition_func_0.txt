The function `func` reads three integer inputs `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user. It then compares the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on certain conditions. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0' in that case, otherwise it prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, it prints '?'. The function does not explicitly return a value but prints the corresponding symbol based on the conditions.
