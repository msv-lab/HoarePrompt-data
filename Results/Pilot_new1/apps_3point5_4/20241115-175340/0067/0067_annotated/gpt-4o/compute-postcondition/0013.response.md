Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If the sum of `y` and `z` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '+'. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the program prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'. In all cases, the values of `min_downvotes`, `max_downvotes`, and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged.***
