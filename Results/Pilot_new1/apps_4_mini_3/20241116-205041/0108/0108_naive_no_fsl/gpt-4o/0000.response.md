Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the requirement that characters can be replaced with their next alphabetical character. The logic only checks if the string `s` contains the characters of the English alphabet in order but does not account for the possibility of transforming characters to reach the required subsequence.

For example, consider the input string `aabbccddeeffgg`. The program will output `-1` because it does not find the full alphabet as a subsequence. However, it is possible to transform the characters in `s` to produce the alphabet as a subsequence by replacing characters:

- Replace the first 'a' with 'a' (no change)
- Replace the first 'b' with 'b' (no change)
- Replace the first 'c' with 'c' (no change)
- Replace the first 'd' with 'd' (no change)
- Replace the first 'e' with 'e' (no change)
- Replace the first 'f' with 'f' (no change)
- Replace the first 'g' with 'g' (no change)
- Replace the second 'g' with 'h'
- Replace 'h' with 'i'
- Replace 'i' with 'j'
- Replace 'j' with 'k'
- Replace 'k' with 'l'
- Replace 'l' with 'm'
- Replace 'm' with 'n'
- Replace 'n' with 'o'
- Replace 'o' with 'p'
- Replace 'p' with 'q'
- Replace 'q' with 'r'
- Replace 'r' with 's'
- Replace 's' with 't'
- Replace 't' with 'u'
- Replace 'u' with 'v'
- Replace 'v' with 'w'
- Replace 'w' with 'x'
- Replace 'x' with 'y'
- Replace 'y' with 'z'

Thus, the program fails to account for the transformation possibilities and incorrectly determines that it is impossible to create the required subsequence in certain cases.
