The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown (only that it is less than 26). Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been increased by 1 without changing the other variables. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is increased by 1**
