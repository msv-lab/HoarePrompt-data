Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, and `j` is either 0 or 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented to 1; otherwise, `j` remains 0, indicating no match was found.***
