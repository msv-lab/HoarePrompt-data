Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If `s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is equal to 26, and the program attempts to print `target`, which may lead to an error if `target` is undefined. If `s` is empty, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, resulting in the output of -1. If `s` is shorter than needed to match 'a' to 'z', then `i` is the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26, leading to the output of -1 as well.***
