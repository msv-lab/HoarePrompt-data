The variables `i` and `j` are both assigned the value `0`. The previous values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
