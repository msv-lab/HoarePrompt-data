Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and if `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, `j` must be less than 26 to ensure it stays within the bounds of the `target` string.***
