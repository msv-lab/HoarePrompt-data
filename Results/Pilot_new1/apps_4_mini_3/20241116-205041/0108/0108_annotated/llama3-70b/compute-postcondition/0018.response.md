The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it, which means `res` now contains one additional occurrence of `char`. The states of the other variables (`s` and `char`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII and `char` is still in `s`.

Output State: **`res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII and `char` is still in `s**
