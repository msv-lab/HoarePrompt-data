According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `alphabet`, which consists of the lowercase English letters. The loop will execute regardless of the content of the string `s`, as it only depends on the `alphabet`. 

Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty string, and `char` will take on each character from `alphabet` sequentially. The initial conditions are sufficient for the loop to execute, as `alphabet` is defined and contains valid characters.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a' (the first character in alphabet)**
