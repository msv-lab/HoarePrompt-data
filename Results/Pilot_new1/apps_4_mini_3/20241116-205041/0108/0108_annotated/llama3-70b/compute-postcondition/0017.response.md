According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`, and `s` has been updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the modified string `s`. Since we do not have the exact content of `s` after the replacement, we need to ensure that `char` is still in `s` after this modification.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `char` remains in `s`. This means that the replacement should not remove all occurrences of `char` from `s`. 

State: **`res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII and `char` is still in `s`**
