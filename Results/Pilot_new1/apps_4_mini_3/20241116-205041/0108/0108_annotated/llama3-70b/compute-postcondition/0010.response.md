The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'aa', and the value of `char` is 'a'. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'a' and at least one 'b'; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'aaa'; `char` is 'a'**
