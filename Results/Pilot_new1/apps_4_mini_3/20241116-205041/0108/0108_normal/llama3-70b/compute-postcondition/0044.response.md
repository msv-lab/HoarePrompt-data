Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads a string input `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by replacing each occurrence of a character from 'a' to 'z' in `s` with the next character in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', etc.). If `res` contains all 26 letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` does not contain any letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` will be empty, and the function will print -1. If `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` will contain the shifted characters, and `s` will have all occurrences of these characters removed.**
