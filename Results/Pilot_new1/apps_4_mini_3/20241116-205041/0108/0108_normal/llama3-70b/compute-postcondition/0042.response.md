Postcondition: ***`res` is a string that contains the characters from 'b' to 'a' if all characters from 'a' to 'z' were present in `s`, and `s` has been modified to remove all occurrences of these characters. If `res` contains all 26 characters, the function prints `res`. Otherwise, if `res` is empty (indicating `s` contained no characters from 'a' to 'z'), `s` remains unchanged, and the function prints -1. Additionally, if `s` originally contained all characters from 'a' to 'z', `char` will be the character following 'z' in the alphabet.***
