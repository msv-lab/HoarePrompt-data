Output State: **`res` will be a string containing the characters from `s` in the order they appeared, with each character replaced by its subsequent character in the alphabet (e.g., 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', etc.). If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string while `s` remains unchanged. If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will execute for each character in `alphabet`, modifying `s` and appending to `res` until no occurrences of the current character are left in `s`. After the loop, `s` will have no occurrences of the last processed character, and `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last processed character. If `s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` will be the same string as `s` with each character shifted to the next character in the alphabet.**
