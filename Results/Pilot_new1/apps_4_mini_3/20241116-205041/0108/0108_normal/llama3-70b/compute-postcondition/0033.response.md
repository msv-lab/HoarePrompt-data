The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next ASCII character of `char`, which is calculated using `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The state of `res` is not directly affected by this operation, but `s` will change based on the replacement. The previous values of `s` and `char` are not specified, so we cannot provide their specific values.

Output State: **`s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next ASCII character of `char`, and `res` remains unchanged.**
