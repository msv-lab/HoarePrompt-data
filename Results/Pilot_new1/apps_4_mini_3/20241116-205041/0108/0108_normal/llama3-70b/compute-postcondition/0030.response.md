The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that is one position after `char` in the ASCII table. The value of `s` is modified, but the values of `res`, `next_char`, and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the modified `s` and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `next_char` and `char`; `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next ASCII character.**
