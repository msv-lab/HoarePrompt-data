Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. If there is no match, `j` remains unchanged. The value of `j` will thus be either incremented by 1 or retain its original value, ensuring it stays less than 26.***
