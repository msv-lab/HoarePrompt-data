The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 2, after execution, `i` becomes 3. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is less than 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` is less than 26**
