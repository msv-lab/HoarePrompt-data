Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is less than or equal to 26 after increment. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, which means `j` can take values from its original value up to 26. If there is no match, `j` remains unchanged, thus remaining less than or equal to 26.***
