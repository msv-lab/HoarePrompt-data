The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than or equal to 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than or equal to 26**
