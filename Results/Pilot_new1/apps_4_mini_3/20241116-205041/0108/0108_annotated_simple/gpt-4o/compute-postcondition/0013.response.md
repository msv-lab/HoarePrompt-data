The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The values of `i`, `len(s)`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than `j`, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than `j`, and `j` is increased by 1**
