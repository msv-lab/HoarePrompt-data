According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is unchanged, and `target_len` is 26. The length of `s` is unknown, but for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. 

Since `i` is currently 1, the length of `s` must be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the length of `s` is greater than 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and len(s) is greater than 1, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is unchanged**
