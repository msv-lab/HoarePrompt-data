The `target_len` variable is assigned the value of `len(target)`, where `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The length of this string is 26. The variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26**
