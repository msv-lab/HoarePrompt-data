The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. Since `res` initially contains 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s` plus `char`, after execution, `res` will now include one additional instance of `char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it still contains `char`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s` plus `char`, and `s` still contains `char`.

Output State: **`res` is 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s` plus `char`, and `s` still contains `char`**
