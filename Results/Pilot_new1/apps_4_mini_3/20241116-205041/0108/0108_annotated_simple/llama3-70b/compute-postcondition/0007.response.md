`res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'a', and the value of `char` is also 'a'. Therefore, `res` becomes 'a' + 'a', which is 'aa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the output state is: `s` must contain at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` must contain at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
