The code `res += char` appends the value of `char`, which is 'a', to the string `res`. Since `res` is initially an empty string, after execution, `res` will contain 'a'. The other variables `s` and `alphabet` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', and `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
