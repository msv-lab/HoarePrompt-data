To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. The sequence starts with `a` and has a common difference `c`.
2. We need to check if the number `b` appears in this sequence.
3. The sequence can be defined as:
   - If `c = 0`, the sequence is constant and equal to `a`. Thus, `b` can only appear if `a == b`.
   - If `c â‰  0`, the terms of the sequence can be expressed as:
     - \( s_i = a + (i - 1) * c \)
     - Rearranging gives us \( b = a + k * c \) for some non-negative integer `k`.
     - This leads to the conditions:
       - \( (b - a) \mod c = 0 \) (to ensure `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`)
       - \( (b - a) / c \geq 0 \) (to ensure we are not stepping backwards if `c` is positive)

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if (c == 0) :
        if (a == b) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
    else :
        if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) :
            print('YES')
        else :
            print('NO')
```

### Logical Flow
- **Case when `c == 0`:**
  - If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints "YES".
  - If `a` is not equal to `b`, it prints "NO".
  - This is correct as `b` can only be equal to `a` when `c` is zero.

- **Case when `c != 0`:**
  - It checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to ensure that `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`.
  - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., not stepping backwards when `c` is positive).
  - This logic is also correct as it captures all necessary conditions for `b` to appear in the sequence.

### Edge Cases
1. **When `c` is negative:** 
   - The program correctly checks if `b` can be reached in reverse, as `(b - a) / c` will be negative if `b` is less than `a` and `c` is negative.

2. **Large values of `a`, `b`, and `c`:** 
   - The program handles the full range of inputs as specified by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the logic and potential edge cases, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. There are no cases where it fails to produce the correct output based on the input values.

Correctness: **True**
