The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input after being converted to integers by the `map(int, input().split())` function. Since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers resulting from the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on input values**
