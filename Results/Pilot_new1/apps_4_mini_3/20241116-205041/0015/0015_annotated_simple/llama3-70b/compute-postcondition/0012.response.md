Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0, 'NO' is printed. This covers all cases, including when `(b - a)` is negative, zero, or positive, as well as when the division results in a negative value.***
