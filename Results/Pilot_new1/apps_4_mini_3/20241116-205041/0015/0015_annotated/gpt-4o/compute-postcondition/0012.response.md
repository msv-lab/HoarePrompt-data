Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative result from the division, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes all cases where `c` is positive or negative, and where `(b - a)` is positive, zero, or negative.***
