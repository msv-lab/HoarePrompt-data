The code prints 'YES', which does not change the state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The previous state of the variables remains unchanged, but the output indicates that the condition regarding the integers holds true. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`; and the result of the division of (b - a) by c is non-negative. Additionally, 'YES' is printed.
