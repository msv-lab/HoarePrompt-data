The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9; the value of `c` is equal to 0; `a` is not equal to `b`; and the output is 'NO'.**
