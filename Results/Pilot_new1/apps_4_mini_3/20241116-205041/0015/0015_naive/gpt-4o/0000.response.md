To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly identifies if the integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the difference `c`.

The sequence can be described as:
- The first element is `a` (s_1 = a).
- Each subsequent element is derived by adding `c` to the previous element: s_i = a + (i - 1) * c.

The program checks the following conditions:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints "YES".
2. If `c` is 0 and `b` is not equal to `a`, it prints "NO" (since all elements would be `a`).
3. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, it prints "YES".
4. If none of the above conditions are satisfied, it prints "NO".

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the program with specific test cases:

### Test Cases:
1. **Case where `c` is positive and `b` is in the sequence:**
   - Input: `1 7 3`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - The sequence is `1, 4, 7, ...` which includes `7`.
   - The program correctly identifies this.

2. **Case where `c` is zero and `b` is equal to `a`:**
   - Input: `10 10 0`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - The sequence is always `10`.
   - The program correctly identifies this.

3. **Case where `c` is positive and `b` is less than `a`:**
   - Input: `1 -4 5`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - The sequence is `1, 6, 11, ...` which does not include `-4`.
   - The program correctly identifies this.

4. **Case where `c` is positive and `b` is greater than all elements in the sequence:**
   - Input: `0 60 50`
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - The sequence is `0, 50, 100, ...` which does not include `60`.
   - The program correctly identifies this.

5. **Edge case where `c` is negative:**
   - Input: `10 5 -5`
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - The sequence is `10, 5, 0, -5, ...` which includes `5`.
   - The program should return `YES` since `(5 - 10) % (-5) == 0` and `(5 - 10) / (-5) < 0` (which is incorrect logic in the program).

### Analysis:
The program does not handle the case where `c` is negative correctly. Specifically, when `c` is negative, the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` will not hold true even if `b` is indeed part of the sequence. For example, in the test case where `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = -5`, the sequence includes `5`, but the program would incorrectly return "NO".

Thus, we can conclude that the program is not correct because it fails to account for sequences where `c` is negative.

Correctness: **False**.
