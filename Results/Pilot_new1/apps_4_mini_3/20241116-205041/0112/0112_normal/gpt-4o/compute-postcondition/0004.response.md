According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, as `n` is at least 1. The loop variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The state of `digit` is already set to the first element in `digits`, and `used_cubes` is initialized correctly with all elements set to False, which is appropriate for the loop's execution. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are minimal, as they already align with the requirements for the loop to execute. The loop can start with `i` being 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0**
