The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which is its initial state and does not change. The values of the other variables (`used_cubes` and `digits`) remain unchanged as well, and there are no changes to the program's state. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `used_cubes` is unchanged, and `digits` has at least two more elements.

Output State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` is unchanged, `digits` has at least two more elements**
