The value of `found` is assigned `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the state of `found` remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `digits`, `digit`, `used_cubes`, and `i`) are not affected. Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[i]` set to True, `found` is True, `i` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[i]` set to True, `found` is True, `i` is equal to `n`**
