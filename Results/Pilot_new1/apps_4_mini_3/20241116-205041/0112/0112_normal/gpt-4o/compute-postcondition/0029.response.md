According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least two more elements. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `digits` must have at least three elements, and the next `digit` should be the next element in the list.

Since we don't have the specific number of elements in `digits`, we can denote the state accordingly. If `digits` has at least two more elements, it implies that it has at least three elements in total.

State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` is unchanged, `digits` has at least three elements**
