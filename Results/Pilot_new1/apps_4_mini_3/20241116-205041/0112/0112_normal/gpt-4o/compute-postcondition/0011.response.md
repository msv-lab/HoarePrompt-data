The code assigns the value `True` to `used_cubes[i]`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which can be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the index `i` will be valid for the `used_cubes` list, and the element at that index will be set to `True`. The previous values of `used_cubes` are not specified, but the length of `used_cubes` is `n`, which is between 1 and 3. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[i]` set to True, `found` is True, `i` is equal to `n`.**
