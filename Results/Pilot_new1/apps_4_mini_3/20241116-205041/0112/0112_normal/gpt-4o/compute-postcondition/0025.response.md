According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` collection. If `digits` has at least one more element, the loop will execute one more time. Since the state indicates that `found` is True, it implies that the previous iteration did not return False, and the loop has not yet exhausted all elements in `digits`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the `digits` collection has at least one more digit remaining. The state of `found` remains True, and the state of `used_cubes` is unchanged.

State: **`found` is True, `used_cubes` is unchanged, `digits` has at least one more element**
