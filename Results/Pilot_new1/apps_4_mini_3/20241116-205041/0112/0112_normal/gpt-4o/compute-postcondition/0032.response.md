The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. The parameter `cube_faces` is a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9. 

After executing the function body, if `n` is 0 or `digits` is empty, the function does not execute the loop, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all False). If `n` > 0 and all elements in `used_cubes` are True, the loop does not execute and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all True). If all digits are matched successfully, `used_cubes` will have True values corresponding to the matched digits; otherwise, the function returns False. 

In Case 2, the program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can_form_number is to accept an integer `n` and a list of integers `cube_faces`, and determine if a number can be formed based on the conditions specified, returning True or False based on the matching of digits. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of 6 integers (each between 0 and 9), and returns True if the digits can be matched successfully; otherwise, it returns False.**
