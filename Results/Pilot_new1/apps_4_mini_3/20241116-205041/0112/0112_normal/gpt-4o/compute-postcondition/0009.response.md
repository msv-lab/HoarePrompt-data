Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where the element at index `i` is set to True if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]`, the values of `used_cubes` and `found` remain unchanged, and the loop continues. If `i` exceeds the bounds of `used_cubes`, the loop terminates without modifying `used_cubes` or `found`.***
