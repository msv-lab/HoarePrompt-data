The value of `i` is `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. Since `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, this assignment will affect the element at index `i` in `used_cubes`. The previous values of `used_cubes` are not specified, but we know its length is `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`; `used_cubes` has `used_cubes[i]` set to True; `found` is True; `i` is `n`**
