According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least one more element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `digits` to indicate that it has at least two more elements remaining. Additionally, since the loop iterates over `digits`, the current `digit` should be updated to the next element in the list, and the iteration count should reflect that.

State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` is unchanged, `digits` has at least two more elements, digit is the next element in the list**
