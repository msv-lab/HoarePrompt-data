The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it is already `True` based on the initial state. Therefore, the state of the variable does not change. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`; `used_cubes` has `used_cubes[i]` set to True; `found` is True; `i` is `n`**
