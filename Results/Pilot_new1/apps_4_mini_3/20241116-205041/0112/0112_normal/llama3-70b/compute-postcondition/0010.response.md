Output State: **`digits` is updated to contain string representations of all integers found in the lists of `cubes`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is between 1 and 3, the loop executes 1 to 3 times, updating `digits` accordingly with the unique string representations of the integers in each list of `cubes`.**
