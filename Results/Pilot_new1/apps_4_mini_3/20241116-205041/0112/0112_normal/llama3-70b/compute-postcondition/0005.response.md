According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each `cube` in `cubes`, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, there are currently `n` lists in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is such that it can be either 1, 2, or 3, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more list in `cubes` that has not yet been iterated over. If `n` is currently 1, then the loop has already executed for the only list present, and it cannot execute again. If `n` is 2, it has executed for the first list, and for it to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to 2, with `cube` being the second list in `cubes`. If `n` is 3, it has executed for the first list, and for it to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to 3, with `cube` being the second list in `cubes`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- If `n` is 1, it cannot execute again.
- If `n` is 2, `cube` should be the second list in `cubes`.
- If `n` is 3, `cube` should be the second list in `cubes`.

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `n` from the information provided, we can only state that for `n` to allow another iteration, it must be at least 2, and `cube` must be the second list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
