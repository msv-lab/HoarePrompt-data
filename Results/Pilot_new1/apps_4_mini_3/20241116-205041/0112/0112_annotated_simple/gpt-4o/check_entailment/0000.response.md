To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, cubes)`**:
   - It initializes a list `cube_faces` where each element is a set of the faces of the cubes.
   - It initializes `x` to 0 and enters a while loop that checks if it can form the number `x + 1` using the `can_form_number` function.

2. **Function `can_form_number(num)`**:
   - Converts the number `num` to its digits and initializes a `used_cubes` list to track which cubes are used.
   - For each digit in the number, it checks if there is an unused cube that contains that digit. If found, it marks that cube as used.
   - If all digits can be matched with the cubes, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues in the Code

- The program does not handle the case where leading zeros are present in the number being formed. The problem states that numbers cannot contain leading zeros, but the code does not check for this condition. For instance, if Masha has cubes with faces that can form the number "01", the program would incorrectly consider it valid, even though "01" is not a natural number.
  
- The program assumes that the cubes can be used in any order, but it does not account for the potential limitation of having insufficient cubes to represent a digit multiple times when needed (e.g., needing two '8's to form the number '88').

### Example of Failure Case

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
- The program should be able to form numbers from 1 to 98, but it would incorrectly consider it able to form 100 or 101 due to the presence of leading zeros (if it checks for 100, it would look for '1' and then '0', which could lead to incorrect conclusions).

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, particularly the handling of leading zeros and the potential limitations in using digits from the cubes, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
