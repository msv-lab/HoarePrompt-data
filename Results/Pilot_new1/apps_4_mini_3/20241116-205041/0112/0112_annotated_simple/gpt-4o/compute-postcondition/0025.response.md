To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `digits`, which means that for the loop to execute again, there must be another `digit` available in the `digits` collection.
2. The state mentions that `found` is True, indicating that at least one `used_cubes[i]` was initially False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` for some `i` in the range of `n`. This implies that the loop has successfully processed at least one `digit` from `digits`.
3. We need to ensure that the next `digit` is available for the loop to continue executing.

Given this understanding, we can conclude that:

- If `found` is True, we can assume that there was at least one `digit` processed, but we need to check if there are more `digits` left to process.
- The state of `used_cubes` and `cube_faces` does not need to be changed since they are already updated based on the last iteration.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is still at least one more `digit` to process in the `digits` list.

State: **`found` is True, there is at least one more digit in `digits` to process**
