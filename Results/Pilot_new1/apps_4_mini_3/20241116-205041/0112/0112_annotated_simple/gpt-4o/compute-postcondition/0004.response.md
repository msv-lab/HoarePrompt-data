According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The variable `digit` is already set to the first digit in the `digits` list, and `found` is False, which doesn't affect the execution of the loop. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the state needs to reflect that `i` starts at 0. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
