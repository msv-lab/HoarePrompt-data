According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, the `digits` list must contain at least one digit. The variables `n` and `used_cubes` do not directly affect the execution of the loop but provide context for the loop body.

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we know that it is at least 1, which means `used_cubes` is initialized correctly. However, we need to ensure that `digits` is not empty for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `digits` must contain at least 1 digit. The loop will start with `digit` being the first element in `digits`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list**
