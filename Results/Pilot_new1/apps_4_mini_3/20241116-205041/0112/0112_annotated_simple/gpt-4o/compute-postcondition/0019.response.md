Postcondition: ***`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, and `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[2]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` remains unchanged, `found` remains False, and the program continues without making any changes.***
