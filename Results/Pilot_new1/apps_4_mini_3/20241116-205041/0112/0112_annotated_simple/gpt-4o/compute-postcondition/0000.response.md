The variable `num` is not provided in the initial state, but it is expected to be an integer. The code converts `num` to a string, then creates a list of its digits by converting each character back to an integer. The output state will depend on the value of `num`, which is not specified. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `digits` is a list of the digits of `num`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num`**
