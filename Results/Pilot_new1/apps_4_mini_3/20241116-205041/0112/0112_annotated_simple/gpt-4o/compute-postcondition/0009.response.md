Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, and `used_cubes[i]` is set to True if `used_cubes[i]` was initially False and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`. If `used_cubes[i]` was already True or if `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. The loop or if statement is exited after this check.***
