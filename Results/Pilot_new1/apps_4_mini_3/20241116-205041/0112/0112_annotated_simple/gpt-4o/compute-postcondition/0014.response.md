Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, and `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` remains True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` retains its original value of True.***
