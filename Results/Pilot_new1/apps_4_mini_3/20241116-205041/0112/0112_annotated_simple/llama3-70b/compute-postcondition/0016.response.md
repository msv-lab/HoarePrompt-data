The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and it processes a cube that contains 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` where 0 ≤ `a_{i}_{j}` ≤ 9. 

The output of the function is not explicitly described in the provided information. Therefore, I will summarize the constraints and expected behavior based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates on an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a cube of 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) to produce a result based on these inputs. The specific output behavior is not detailed.**
