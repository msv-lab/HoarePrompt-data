Output State: **`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of each `digit` in `cube_faces`. If all `digits` are found in `cube_faces`, `used_cubes` will have some True values corresponding to the used cube faces. If any `digit` is not found in any of the cube faces and `found` remains False, the function returns False. If `n` is outside the specified bounds (less than 1 or greater than 3), this situation is not expected to occur based on the precondition, thus it is assumed that `found` would be appropriately set in valid cases. If `digits` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains a list of `n` False values.**
