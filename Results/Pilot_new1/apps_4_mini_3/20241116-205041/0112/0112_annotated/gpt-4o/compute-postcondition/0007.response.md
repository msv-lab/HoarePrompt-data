The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, and this change indicates that a condition has been met. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` has `i`th element as True, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.
