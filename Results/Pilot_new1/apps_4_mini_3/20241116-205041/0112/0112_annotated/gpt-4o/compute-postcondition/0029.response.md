According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more elements in `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element, and `digit` is set to the next element in `digits`. 

To prepare for the next iteration, `digit` will need to be updated to the next element in the `digits` list. Since `digits` has at least one more element, we can conclude that `digit` should now refer to that next element. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `digit` has moved to the next element in the `digits` list, while `found` remains False.

State: **`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`, `found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element, `digit` is the next element in `digits`**
