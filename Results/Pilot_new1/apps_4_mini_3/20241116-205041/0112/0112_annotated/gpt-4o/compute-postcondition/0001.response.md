The code initializes a list called `used_cubes` with `False` values. The length of this list is determined by the value of `n`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. Therefore, `used_cubes` will contain `n` elements, all set to `False`. The variable `digits` remains unaffected. 

If `n` is 1, `used_cubes` will be `[False]`.  
If `n` is 2, `used_cubes` will be `[False, False]`.  
If `n` is 3, `used_cubes` will be `[False, False, False]`.  

The output state reflects the current values of `n` and `used_cubes`, while `digits` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num` as strings; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` False values**
