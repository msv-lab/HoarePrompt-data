The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be formed using faces from a list of cubes, where each cube face contains digits from 0 to 9. It returns True if all digits can be matched to the cube faces without reusing any face; otherwise, it returns False. The function assumes that `num` is a valid integer, but it does not handle cases where `num` is outside the expected bounds or where `cube_faces` is not provided, which could lead to errors. If `num` is 0, it will be treated as a digit, but it is not explicitly handled in the annotations.
