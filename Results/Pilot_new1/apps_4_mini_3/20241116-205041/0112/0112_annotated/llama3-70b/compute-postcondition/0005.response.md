According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 2 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

To enable the loop to execute one more time, the state of `cubes` must reflect that it contains at least 2 lists. Additionally, since `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and assuming the loop processes each list in `cubes` sequentially, `cube` should be updated to reflect the second list in `cubes` for the next iteration. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `cubes` must have at least 2 lists, `cube` must be updated to the second list in `cubes`, and `n` can remain unchanged as it does not directly affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to include string representations of digits from `cube`**
