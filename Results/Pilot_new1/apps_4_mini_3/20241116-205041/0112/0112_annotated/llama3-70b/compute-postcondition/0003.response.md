According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we can infer that `cubes` should be a list with at least one element (since `n` is at least 1). Additionally, `cube` will represent the first list in `cubes` during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `cubes` must have at least 1 list, and `cube` should be the first list in `cubes`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
