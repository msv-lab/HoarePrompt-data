The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraint that \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 1000\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent quantities of lemons, apples, and pears within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000.**
