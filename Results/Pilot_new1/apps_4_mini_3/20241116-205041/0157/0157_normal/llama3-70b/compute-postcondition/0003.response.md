The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, `min_lemon` will be the smallest of these three calculated values. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
