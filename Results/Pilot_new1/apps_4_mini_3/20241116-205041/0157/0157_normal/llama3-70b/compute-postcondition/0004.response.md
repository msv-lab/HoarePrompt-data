To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state.

1. The initial state defines `a`, `b`, and `c` as input integers.
2. The variable `min_lemon` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This means it takes the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`.
3. The code then prints the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This expression can be simplified:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be factored as `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute a numerical result for `min_lemon`. However, we can express the output in terms of `min_lemon`.

Therefore, the output state will indicate the relationship and calculation performed:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and the printed result is min_lemon * 7**.
