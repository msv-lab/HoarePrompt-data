To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step.

1. The initial state includes:
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a new input integer.
   - `c` is a new input integer.
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
   - `total_fruits` is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`.

2. The code snippet `print(total_fruits)` outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

3. Since `max_lemons` is determined by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, `total_fruits` will also depend on these input values.

Thus, the output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`**.
