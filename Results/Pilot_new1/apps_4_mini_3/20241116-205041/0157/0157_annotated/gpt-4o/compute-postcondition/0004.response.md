To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is a new input integer
- `c` is a new input integer
- `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`

The code calculates `total_fruits` as follows:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

This can be simplified to:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
```

Thus, `total_fruits` will be `7 * max_lemons`.

Since `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, we can summarize the output state based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, and `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`.**
