To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description. 

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears. The recipe requires these fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4. This means:
- For every lemon, he needs 2 apples and 4 pears.
  
The task is to calculate the maximum total number of fruits (lemons + apples + pears) that can be used based on the available quantities.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func()` does the following:
1. It takes three integer inputs representing the quantities of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the available lemons, apples (divided by 2), or pears (divided by 4).
3. It calculates the total number of fruits used as:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

### Edge Cases and Examples:
Let's evaluate the provided examples against the code logic:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `2`, `5`, `7`
   - `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Total fruits: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4`, `7`, `13`
   - `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Total fruits: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2`, `3`, `2`
   - `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Total fruits: `0` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
The annotations mention that the function calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the constraints and computes the total fruits accordingly. All examples provided in the problem description align with the function's output, confirming that the logic is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases. The annotations accurately reflect the functionality of the code, and no discrepancies have been found.

Correctness: **True**
