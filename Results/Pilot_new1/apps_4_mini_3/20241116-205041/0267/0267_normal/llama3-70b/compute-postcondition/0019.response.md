The code updates `dp[n, k]` using the modulo operation with `MOD`. Since the initial state specifies that if `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9, and if `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on some formula, we can infer that `dp[n, k]` will be affected based on the value of `k`.

However, since the code only states `dp[n, k] %= MOD`, we need to consider the value of `dp[n, k]` before this operation. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9, and if `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` would have been updated to some value based on the unspecified formula.

Assuming `MOD` is greater than 9, the value of `dp[n, k]` would remain unchanged if `k` is 1. If `k` is between 2 and 10, we do not have the exact updated value, but we can state that `dp[n, k]` will be taken modulo `MOD`.

Thus, the output state will depend on the value of `k`:

1. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9.
2. If `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` will be `dp[n, k]` mod `MOD`.

Since we do not have the specific value of `MOD` or the updated `dp[n, k]` for `k` between 2 and 10, we will represent the output state accordingly.

Output State: **If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9; if `k` is between 2 and 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on `dp[n, k] % MOD`.**
