The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The value of `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of `num` and `MOD` are not specified, but we know that `total_sum` will be updated based on their values. The value of `total_sum` after the execution will depend on the values of `num` and `MOD`, but since `total_sum` starts at 0, the output state will reflect that it has been updated.

Output State: **`l` is `r + 1`, `r` is unchanged, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to (0 + num) % MOD**
