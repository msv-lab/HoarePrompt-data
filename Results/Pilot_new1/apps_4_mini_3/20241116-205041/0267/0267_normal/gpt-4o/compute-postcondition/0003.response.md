The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, and the result of func_1(l, k) is true.**
