The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its previous value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, but the value of `num` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `total_sum`. The other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_sum` based on the unknown value of `num`.

Output State: **`l` is `r`, `r` is unchanged, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is (0 + num) % MOD**
