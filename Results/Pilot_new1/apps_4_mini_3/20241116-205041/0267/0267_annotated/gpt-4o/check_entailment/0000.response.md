Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. While the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a number has at most `k` different digits, the function `func_2` has a significant flaw due to its approach to iterating through the range from `l` to `r`.

The major issue is that the code iterates through every integer in the range from `l` to `r`, which can be extremely inefficient and impractical for large values of `r` (up to \(10^{18}\)). This approach does not scale and would not produce results in a reasonable time frame for large ranges. The problem description implies the need for an efficient algorithm to compute the sum based on the digit constraints rather than a simple iteration.

Furthermore, the annotations mention that if `k` is outside the range of 1 to 10, the loop will still execute with `total_sum` unchanged if no valid `num` meets the criteria. This is misleading because `k` should always be between 1 and 10 based on the problem description, and the logic for handling invalid `k` values is not present.

In summary, the code does not meet the performance requirements necessary for the input constraints, and thus it fails to satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
