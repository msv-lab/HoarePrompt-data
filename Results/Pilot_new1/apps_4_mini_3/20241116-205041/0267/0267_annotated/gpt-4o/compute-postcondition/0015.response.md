Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` that define a range and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of all integers `num` in the inclusive range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. If the range is empty (i.e., if `l` is greater than `r`), the function returns 0. Additionally, if no integers in the range satisfy the condition, it also returns 0. The behavior of the function may not be as expected if `k` is outside the range of valid values for `func_1`, but this does not affect the execution of the loop.**
