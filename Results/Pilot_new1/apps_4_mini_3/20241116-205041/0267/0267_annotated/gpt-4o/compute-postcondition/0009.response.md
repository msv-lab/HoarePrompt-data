The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to its previous value and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the specific previous values of `total_sum` and `num` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the effect of the operation without exact values.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is greater than the previous value of `r`, `k` is unchanged, and `total_sum` is updated to (previous total_sum + num) % MOD**
