According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which is already ensured by the state given (1 <= l <= r < 10^18). 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of `l`, which is the first value in the specified range. Since `total_sum` is initialized to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we can conclude that `num` should be equal to `l` at the start of the loop.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
