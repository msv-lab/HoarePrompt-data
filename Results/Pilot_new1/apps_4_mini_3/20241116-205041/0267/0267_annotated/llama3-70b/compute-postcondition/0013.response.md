The code updates the value of `dp[n, k]` based on the current values of `n`, `k`, and `i`. The expression involves multiplying `9` by `10` raised to the power of `i - 1`, and then multiplying that by the difference of `10` raised to the power of `k - i` and `10` raised to the power of `i - 1`. 

Since `k` is between 3 and 10, and `n` is at least 10, the specific values of `l`, `r`, and `dp[n, k]` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact numerical output of `dp[n, k]`. However, we know that `dp[n, k]` will be incremented by a calculated value based on the formula.

Thus, the output state reflects the update to `dp[n, k]`, but without specific values for `dp[n, k]`, the output remains general.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to include an increment based on the formula involving `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`**
