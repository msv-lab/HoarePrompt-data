According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to `r + 1`, which is outside the current range, and thus the loop will not execute again unless `r` is adjusted.

Given that `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `total_sum` is 0 initially, the only way for the loop to execute again is if `r` is increased.

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, we need to adjust `r` to be at least `r + 1`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, and `r` is increased to `r + 1`**
