Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to the value of `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.***
