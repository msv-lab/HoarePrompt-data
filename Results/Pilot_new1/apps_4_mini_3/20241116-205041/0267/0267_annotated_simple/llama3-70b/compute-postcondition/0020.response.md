Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `n` is an integer less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, `dp[n, k]` is updated to 9, and further calculations are performed based on the value of `k` and the digits of `n`, with the final result being taken modulo `MOD`. This includes handling cases where `n` is exactly equal to `10 ** k` and edge cases for the maximum values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.***
