According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value (which is `k-1`), since the `range(1, k)` function generates values starting from 1 up to (but not including) `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k`, which means `k` must be greater than `1`. 

Thus, the conditions need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now `k-1`, and `k` should be greater than `1` for the loop to have executed previously. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * (10`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
