According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer and its value is between 1 and 100, the loop will execute exactly `n` times. The loop variable is not used within the loop body, so it does not affect the execution state. However, since `buses` is an empty list, it does not impact the execution of the loop either. 

To clarify the initial state before the loop starts:
- `n` is a positive integer (which is already given).
- The loop variable `_` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the state can remain as is, and we can indicate that the loop variable `_` will start from 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
