Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum calculated time from all buses where `time` is less than the previous `min_time`, and `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that produced this minimum time; if `buses` is empty, `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1; the function prints `ans`.**
