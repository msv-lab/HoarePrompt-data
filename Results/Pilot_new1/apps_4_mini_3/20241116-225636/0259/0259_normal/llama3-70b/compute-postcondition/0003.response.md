The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values based on the input split into two integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `s` and `d`, as they will be determined by user input. The variables `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and acknowledges that `s` and `d` are now assigned input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are input integers**
