According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if `_` (the loop counter) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)], `_` is 1**
