According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` (the loop variable) is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, the condition for the loop will still hold.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is updated to include the tuple (s, d), `_` is 2, `s` and `d` are input integers**
