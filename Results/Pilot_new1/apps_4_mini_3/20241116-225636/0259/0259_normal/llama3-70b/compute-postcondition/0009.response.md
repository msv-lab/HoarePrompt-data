The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input from the user and mapping it to integers. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown as they are being set from user input. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unaffected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the input integers assigned to `s` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is updated to include the tuple (s, d), `_` is 2, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
