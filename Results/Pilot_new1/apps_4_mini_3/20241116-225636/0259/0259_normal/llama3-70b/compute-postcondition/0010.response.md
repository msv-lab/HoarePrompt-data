The code `buses.append((s, d))` adds a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers. The variable `buses` is updated to include this new tuple, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is updated to include the tuple (s, d), `_` is 2, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
