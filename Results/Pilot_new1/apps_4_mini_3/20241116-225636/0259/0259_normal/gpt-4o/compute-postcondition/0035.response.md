`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The values of `min_wait_time` and `i` remain unchanged, while `chosen_route` is updated based on the current value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated `chosen_route`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`; `i` is unchanged**
