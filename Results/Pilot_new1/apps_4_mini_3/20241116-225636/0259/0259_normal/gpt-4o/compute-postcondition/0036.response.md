Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, and `wait_time` has been updated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[n]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. All edge cases regarding the comparison of `s_i` and `t` are handled, including when `s_i` equals `t`, `s_i` is less than `t` and divisible by `d_i`, or when `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`.***
