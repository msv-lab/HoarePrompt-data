The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the second tuple in the `bus_routes` list, as `i` is 1. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will depend on the contents of `bus_routes`. The previous values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not specified, but they will be updated to the values from `bus_routes[1]`. 

Since `bus_routes` contains positive integers, the output state will reflect that `s_i` and `d_i` are now equal to the first and second elements of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1]**
