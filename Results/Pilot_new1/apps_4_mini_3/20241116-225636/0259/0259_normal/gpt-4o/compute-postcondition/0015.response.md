The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The current value of `i` is 0, so `chosen_route` becomes 0 + 1 = 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.**
