The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference (t - s_i) is divisible by d_i; `wait_time` is 0**
