The code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The previous value of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and the value of `wait_time` depends on the conditions related to `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. Since the exact value of `wait_time` is not provided, we cannot determine its specific value. Thus, the output state reflects that `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, but we cannot specify the exact value of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, which is determined by the conditions of `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`**.
