The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the `bus_routes` list at index `i`. Since `i` is 1, this means `s_i` and `d_i` will take the values of the second tuple in the `bus_routes` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the values of `s_i` and `d_i` based on the contents of `bus_routes`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[1]`**
