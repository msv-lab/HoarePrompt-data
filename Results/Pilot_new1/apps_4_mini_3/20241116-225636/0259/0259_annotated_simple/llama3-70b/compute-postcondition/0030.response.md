Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, and `(s, d)` is the third tuple in the buses list. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is set to 3. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
