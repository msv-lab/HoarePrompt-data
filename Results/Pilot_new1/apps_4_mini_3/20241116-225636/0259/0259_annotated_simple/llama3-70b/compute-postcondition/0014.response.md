The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `-1`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the program. The previous state of `buses` and `min_time` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of input integers (s, d); `min_time` is set to positive infinity; `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of input integers (s, d); `min_time` is set to positive infinity; `ans` is -1**
