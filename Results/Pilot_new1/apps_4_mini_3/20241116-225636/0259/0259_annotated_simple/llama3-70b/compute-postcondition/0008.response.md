According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as the loop counter (represented by `_` in this case) is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), meaning that it can be any value in that range. Since the loop is executed `n` times, after the last iteration, the loop counter would have reached `n`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase the value of `n` by at least 1 (making it greater than the previous value) since it must be greater than the current count of iterations. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `t` and `buses` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 100, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains the original tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
