The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The current state of `buses` will now include this new tuple, while the values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `buses` now contains the original tuples along with the newly added tuple `(s, d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains the original tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
