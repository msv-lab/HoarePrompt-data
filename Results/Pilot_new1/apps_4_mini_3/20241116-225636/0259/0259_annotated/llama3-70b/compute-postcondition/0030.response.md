Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing at least `i + 3` tuples, `i` is `i + 1`, and `time` is assigned the value of `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
