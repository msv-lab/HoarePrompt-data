The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers. After executing the code, `buses` will contain one element, which is the tuple of the input integers. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), and `s`, `d` are input integers**
