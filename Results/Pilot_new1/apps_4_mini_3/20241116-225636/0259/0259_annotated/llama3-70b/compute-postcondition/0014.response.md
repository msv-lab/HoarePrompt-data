The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `-1`. The values of `buses` and `min_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1**
