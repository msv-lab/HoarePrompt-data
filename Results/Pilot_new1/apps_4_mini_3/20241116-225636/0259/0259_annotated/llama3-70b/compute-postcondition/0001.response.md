The code initializes `buses` as an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100000, and `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100000, and `buses` is an empty list**
