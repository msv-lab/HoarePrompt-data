Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is determined based on the following conditions: if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`; if `t - s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged throughout all cases.***
