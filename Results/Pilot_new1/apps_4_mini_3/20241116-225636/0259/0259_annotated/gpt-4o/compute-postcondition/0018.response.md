The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` will take the values from the second element of the `bus_routes` list (assuming `bus_routes` is a list-like structure). The variables `n`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s_i` and `d_i`, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged**
