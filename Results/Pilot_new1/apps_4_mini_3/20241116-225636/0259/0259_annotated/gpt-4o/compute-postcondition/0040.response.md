The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100).
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time at which the user wants to catch a bus (1 <= t <= 100000).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers: `s_i` (the first bus arrival time) and `d_i` (the bus interval), both of which are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000).

After executing the function body, it returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, referred to as `chosen_route`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time to catch a bus), and bus_routes (list of bus route details), and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.**
