The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the calculation results in `chosen_route` being 3. The states of the other variables (`n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `min_wait_time`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 3**
