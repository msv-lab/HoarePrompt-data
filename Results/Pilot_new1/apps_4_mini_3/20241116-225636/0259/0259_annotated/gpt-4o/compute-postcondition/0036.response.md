Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 3. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` always holds the minimum wait time encountered so far, and `chosen_route` reflects the route associated with that minimum wait time.***
