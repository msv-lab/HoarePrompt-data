The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist2` will be calculated based on these values. The other variables `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `dist1` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to max_pos; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
