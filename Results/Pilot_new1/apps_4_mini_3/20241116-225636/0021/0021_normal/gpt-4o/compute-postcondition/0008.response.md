Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos); max_distance is equal to max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`**
