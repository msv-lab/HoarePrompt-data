The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the element `1` in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and since `n` is between 2 and 100, we can assume that the number `1` is present in the list `a`. The exact position of `1` in the list will determine the value of `pos1`.

Since the specific values of `a` are not provided, we can only conclude that `pos1` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of the element 1 in the list a.**
