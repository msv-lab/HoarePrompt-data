The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is an integer within the range specified (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). The state of the list `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n.**
