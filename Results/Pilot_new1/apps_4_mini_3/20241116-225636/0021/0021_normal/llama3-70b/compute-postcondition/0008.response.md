Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, adjusted by the number of elements in the list. It prints the largest value between the calculated maximum distance and the maximum possible distance from the first or last position in the list to the nearest of these two integers. The function does not handle cases where the input list does not contain the integers 1 or `n`, which could result in a ValueError. **
