To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nicholas has a permutation of integers from 1 to n. He wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap of any two elements in the array.

### Annotated Program Review:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_pos = a.index(1)
    max_pos = a.index(n)
    dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)      # Distance from min (1) to max (n) if min is at index 0
    dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)  # Distance from min (1) to max (n) if min is at index n-1
    dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)      # Distance from max (n) to min (1) if max is at index 0
    dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)  # Distance from max (n) to min (1) if max is at index n-1
    max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
    print(max_distance)
```

### Code Logic Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates four distances:
   - Distance if the minimum is at the start (index 0) and maximum is at its current position.
   - Distance if the minimum is at the end (index n-1) and maximum is at its current position.
   - Distance if the maximum is at the start (index 0) and minimum is at its current position.
   - Distance if the maximum is at the end (index n-1) and minimum is at its current position.
4. It then finds the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Testing for Correctness:
To ensure the program is correct, we need to check if it handles all edge cases properly.

1. **Example Case**: 
   - Input: `5`, `4 5 1 3 2`
   - Expected Output: `3` (Swap `1` with `2` to get `4 2 5 3 1`)
   - The program calculates the distances correctly and outputs `3`.

2. **Example Case**: 
   - Input: `7`, `1 6 5 3 4 7 2`
   - Expected Output: `6` (Swap `7` with `2` to get `1 2 5 3 4 6 7`)
   - The program calculates the distances correctly and outputs `6`.

3. **Example Case**: 
   - Input: `6`, `6 5 4 3 2 1`
   - Expected Output: `5` (Any swap will keep them at max distance)
   - The program calculates the distances correctly and outputs `5`.

### Edge Case Testing:
Now, let's consider an edge case:
- Input: `2`, `2 1`
  - Expected Output: `1` (Swap `1` and `2`)
  - The program calculates the distances correctly and outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap for all tested cases, including edge cases.

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and calculates the maximum possible distance after one swap, adhering to the problem description.
