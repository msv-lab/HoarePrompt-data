To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

1. `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`.
2. The code calculates `dist1` as the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`, which means `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos` since the absolute value of a non-negative number is the number itself.

Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and `max_pos` is defined, the value of `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`, while `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`**.
