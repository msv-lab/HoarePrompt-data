To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step by step based on the problem description.

### Problem Understanding
Nicholas wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

### Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos1 = a.index(1)  # Position of the minimum element (1)
    posn = a.index(n)  # Position of the maximum element (n)
    max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
    min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
    print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

### Breakdown of the Code
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers.
2. **Position Calculation**: It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - `max_dist` is calculated as the maximum of the absolute distance between the two positions minus one and `n - 2`.
   - `min_dist` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute distance between the two positions minus one and `n - 2`.
4. **Final Output**: The program prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Issues with the Code
1. The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not correctly reflect the need to maximize the distance after one swap. It appears to misinterpret the requirement.
2. The logic for computing the maximum possible distance after a swap is flawed. The correct approach should consider the farthest possible positions for 1 and n after one swap, which would be the ends of the array (indices 0 and n-1).

### Counterexample
To illustrate the flaw, consider the input:
```
5
4 5 1 3 2
```
- The positions of 1 and 5 are 2 and 1 respectively (0-based index).
- The current distance is `|2 - 1| = 1`.
- The expected output after one swap should be `3` (by swapping 1 with 2 to place 1 at index 0 and 5 at index 1).

However, the logic in the code does not correctly compute the maximum possible distance for all cases, particularly when the current distance is not at the extremes of the list.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not correctly compute the maximum distance after a swap for all potential cases, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
