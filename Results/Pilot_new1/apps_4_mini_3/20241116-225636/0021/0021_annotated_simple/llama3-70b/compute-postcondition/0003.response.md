The code attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. However, `n` is an integer that represents the size of the list and is not guaranteed to be an element within the list `a`. Therefore, if `n` is not in `a`, this will raise a `ValueError`. 

Since we don't have the specific contents of `a`, we cannot determine if `n` is present in `a`. Thus, the output state must reflect that a potential error can occur.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input; an attempt is made to find the index of `n` in `a`, which may raise a ValueError if `n` is not present in `a`.**
