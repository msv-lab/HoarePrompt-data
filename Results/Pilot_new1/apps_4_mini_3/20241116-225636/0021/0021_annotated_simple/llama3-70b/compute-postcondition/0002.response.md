The code assigns the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in the list `a` to the variable `pos1`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers provided by user input, and `n` is between 2 and 100, the value of `pos1` will depend on the contents of the list `a`. If `1` is present in the list, `pos1` will be an integer representing the index of the first `1`. If `1` is not present, this will raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the value of `pos1` based on the input list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a` (if 1 is present)**.
