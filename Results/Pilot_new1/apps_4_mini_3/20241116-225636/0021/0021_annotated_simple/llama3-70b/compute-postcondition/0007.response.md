The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers within the specified range, but it does not specify what the function returns or performs with these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
