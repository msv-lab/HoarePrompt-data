The code initializes `a` as a list of integers obtained by splitting an input string and mapping each split element to an integer. The value of `n` indicates that the input will contain `n` integers. Since `n` is an input integer, the specific values of the integers in `a` depend on the user input.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers from user input**
