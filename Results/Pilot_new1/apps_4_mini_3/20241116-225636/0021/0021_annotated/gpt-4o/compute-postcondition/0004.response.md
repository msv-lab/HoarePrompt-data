The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` is not specified in the initial state, but it represents the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute value of `-max_pos`, which is simply `max_pos`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_pos`) are not affected by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the current values of all relevant variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos**.
