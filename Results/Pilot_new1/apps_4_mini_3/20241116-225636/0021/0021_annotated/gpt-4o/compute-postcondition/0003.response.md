The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the first occurrence of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 100, and since `a` contains distinct integers including 1, the index returned will be based on the position of `n` in the list `a`. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `min_pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
