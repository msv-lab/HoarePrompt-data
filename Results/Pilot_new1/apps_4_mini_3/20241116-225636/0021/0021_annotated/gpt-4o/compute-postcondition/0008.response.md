Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is min_pos; `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos; `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
