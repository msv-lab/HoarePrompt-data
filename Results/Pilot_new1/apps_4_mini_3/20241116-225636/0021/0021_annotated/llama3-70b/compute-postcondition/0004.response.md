The code calculates `max_dist` as the maximum of two values: the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n - 2`. The value of `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a` or raises a ValueError if `n` is not present in `a`. 

1. The first value calculated is `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.
2. The second value calculated is `n - 2`.
3. The maximum of these two values is assigned to `max_dist`.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` and `posn` will have valid indices as long as `n` is present in `a`.

Output State: **`max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`**.
