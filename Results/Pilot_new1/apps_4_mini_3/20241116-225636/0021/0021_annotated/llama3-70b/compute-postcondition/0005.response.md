To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

Initial State: `max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`

The code snippet:
```
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
```

1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. The previous value of `max_dist` is not directly affected by this assignment, but it is important to note that `max_dist` is defined in terms of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.

Since we do not have specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, or `n`, we cannot calculate exact numerical values for `min_dist` or `max_dist`. However, we can express `min_dist` in relation to the existing variables.

Output State: **`max_dist` is the maximum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`; `min_dist` is the minimum of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2**.
