The code constructs a string representation of the integer `s` in words. It uses the lists `tens` and `ones` to convert the number into its word form. The value of `s` is greater than or equal to 20, meaning it will fall into the range that `tens` can handle. 

- `s // 10` gives the index for the `tens` list, which corresponds to the tens place of `s`.
- `s % 10` gives the index for the `ones` list, which corresponds to the ones place of `s`.
- If `s % 10` is 0, it means there are no additional ones to add, so it concatenates an empty string.
- If `s % 10` is not 0, it concatenates a hyphen and the corresponding word from the `ones` list.

Since `s` is guaranteed to be at least 20, the output will always be a valid string representation in words.

Output State: **`s` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 20, and the output will be the string representation of `s` in words.**
