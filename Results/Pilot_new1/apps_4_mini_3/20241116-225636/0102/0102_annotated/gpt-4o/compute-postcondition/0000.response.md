The code initializes a list called `ones` which contains the string representations of the integers from 0 to 9. The initial state of the variable `s` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `s` and the new list `ones`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `ones` is ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']**
