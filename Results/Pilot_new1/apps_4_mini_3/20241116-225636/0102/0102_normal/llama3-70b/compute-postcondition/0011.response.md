Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output corresponds to the teen number in words from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is the word representation of `s`, which will be a combination of the appropriate word from the `tens` list followed by either an empty string or a hyphen and the corresponding value from the `ones` list, depending on whether `s` is a multiple of 10.***
