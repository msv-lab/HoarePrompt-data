Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation for numbers in the range of 0 to 99. Specifically, it returns 'zero' to 'nine' for values 0 to 9, 'eleven' to 'nineteen' for values 11 to 19, the corresponding 'tens' string for multiples of ten between 10 and 90, and a hyphenated string for other numbers in the range of 10 to 99. However, the function does not handle the case when `n` is 10 or when `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, which are potential edge cases not covered by the current implementation.**
