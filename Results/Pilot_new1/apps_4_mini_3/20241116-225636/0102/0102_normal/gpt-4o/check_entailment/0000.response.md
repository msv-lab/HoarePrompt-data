The provided program aims to convert an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program defines three lists: `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`, which contain the English words for single digits, teen numbers, and multiples of ten, respectively.
2. The function `func_1(n)` checks the input number `n` against various ranges:
   - If `0 <= n <= 9`, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - If `11 <= n <= 19`, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
   - If `10 <= n <= 99`, it handles multiples of ten and combines tens and ones for numbers that aren't multiples of ten.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not handle the case when `n` is exactly 10, which should return "ten".
- It also does not account for negative numbers or numbers greater than 99, but the problem states that the input will always be in the range of 0 to 99.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation for numbers in the range of 0 to 99. They also highlight that the function does not handle the case when `n` is 10, which is a valid edge case. 

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the case when `n` is 10, as it will not return the expected output of "ten". Since this is a clear case where the program does not meet the problem description's requirements, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
