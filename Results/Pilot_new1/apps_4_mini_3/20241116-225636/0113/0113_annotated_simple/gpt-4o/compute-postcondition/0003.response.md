The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as \(x = n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the calculated value of `x` based on the given formula. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, and returns the value of x calculated as n multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and multiplier).**
