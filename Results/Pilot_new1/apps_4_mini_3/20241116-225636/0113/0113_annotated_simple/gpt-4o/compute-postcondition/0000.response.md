The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer between `0` and `8`, so the value of `multiplier` will be `1` (when `k` is `0`), `10` (when `k` is `1`), `100` (when `k` is `2`), `1000` (when `k` is `3`), `10000` (when `k` is `4`), `100000` (when `k` is `5`), `1000000` (when `k` is `6`), `10000000` (when `k` is `7`), or `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 based on the value of `k`.**
