The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` within the specified ranges. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ 8) as parameters.**
