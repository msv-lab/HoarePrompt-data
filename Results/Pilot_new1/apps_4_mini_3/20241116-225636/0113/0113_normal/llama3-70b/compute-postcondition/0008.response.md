Output State: **`if n is not divisible by x, then n` is incremented until it becomes the next integer that is divisible by `x`. After the loop, `n` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `x`. If `n` is already divisible by `x`, the loop does not execute and `n` remains unchanged. `k` is unchanged, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
