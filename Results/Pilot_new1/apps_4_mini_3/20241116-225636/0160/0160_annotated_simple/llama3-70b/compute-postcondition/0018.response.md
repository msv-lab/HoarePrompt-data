Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers from input. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
