Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that may contain `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` will include both `i` and `x // i`, ensuring that all divisors of `x` are captured when `i` is a divisor. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged.***
