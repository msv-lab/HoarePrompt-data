According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Since `i` starts from 1, if `i` is currently `k`, then for the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` is now `k + 1`.

Additionally, since `x` is not explicitly mentioned to change in the context of the loop, it remains the same.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that may contain `i` and `x // i`, `i` is the next integer (current `i + 1`)**
