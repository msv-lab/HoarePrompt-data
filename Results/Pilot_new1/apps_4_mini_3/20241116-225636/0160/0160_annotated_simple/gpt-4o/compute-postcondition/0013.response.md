Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, and if `x` is divisible by `i` (where `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1), then both `i` and `x // i` are added to the set `divisors`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made to the set `divisors`.***
