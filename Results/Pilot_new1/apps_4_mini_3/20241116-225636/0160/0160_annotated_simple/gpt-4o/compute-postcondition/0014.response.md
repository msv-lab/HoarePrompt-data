According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value, which is `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

Since `x` is not mentioned to change, we can keep it as is. The key adjustment is that `i` moves from `int(math.sqrt(x))` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which means the loop will not execute again because `i` will exceed the upper limit of the range.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `i` is now `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
