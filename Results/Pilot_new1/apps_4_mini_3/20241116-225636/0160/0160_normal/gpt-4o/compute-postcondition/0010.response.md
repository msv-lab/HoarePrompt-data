According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is adjusted to `k + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

Since `i` is now `k + 1`, we need to ensure that `k + 1` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. This means that `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as `N`, `K`, and `A` do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= int(math.sqrt(x)) - 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6, and `divisors` is a set that contains `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`.**
