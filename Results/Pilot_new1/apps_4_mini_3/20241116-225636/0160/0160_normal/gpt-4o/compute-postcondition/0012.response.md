Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= int(math.sqrt(x)) - 1; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6; `divisors` is a set that now includes `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x // i` is added to `divisors`.**
