Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged. Additionally, `x` is at least 1 and `i` is at least 1.***
