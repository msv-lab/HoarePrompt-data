The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the new value of `max_divisor` will be either `gcd` or `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The specific outcome depends on the relationship between `gcd` and `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
