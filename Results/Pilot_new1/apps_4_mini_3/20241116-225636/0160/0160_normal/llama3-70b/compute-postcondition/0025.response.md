The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is already defined as `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `i` will be a positive integer. The output state reflects that the value of `max_divisor` may change depending on its previous value and the value of `i`. 

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to int(math.sqrt(gcd)), and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
