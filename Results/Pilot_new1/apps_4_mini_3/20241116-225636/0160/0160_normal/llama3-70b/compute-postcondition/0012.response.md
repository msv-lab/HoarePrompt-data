According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 1 up to the integer square root of `gcd`. For the loop to execute, `gcd` must be at least 1 because the range would be invalid if `gcd` is less than 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to the last value in the range, which is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `gcd` is at least 1 to allow the loop to execute. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
