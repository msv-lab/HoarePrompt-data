The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, its specific value will determine what is added to the set. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this operation, and the state of `divisors` is updated to include the new value of `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the inclusion of `i` in `divisors`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is updated to include `i`, `x` is at least 1, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
