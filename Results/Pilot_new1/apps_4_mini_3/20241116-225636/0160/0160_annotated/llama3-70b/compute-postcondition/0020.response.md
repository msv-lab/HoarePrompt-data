The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is `gcd`, greater than 0) and `i` (which is 2). Since `gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` will take the greater value between `gcd` and 2. Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is either `gcd` (if `gcd` > 2) or 2 (if `gcd` ≤ 2), and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is either `gcd` (if `gcd` > 2) or 2 (if `gcd` ≤ 2); `i` is 2**
