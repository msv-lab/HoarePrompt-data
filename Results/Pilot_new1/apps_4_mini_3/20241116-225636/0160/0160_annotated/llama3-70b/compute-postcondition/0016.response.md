To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state. 

The line of code is:
```
max_divisor = max(max_divisor, gcd // i)
```

- `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`.
- `gcd` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. Therefore, `gcd // i` simplifies to `gcd // 1`, which is equal to `gcd`.
- Since `max_divisor` is the maximum of its previous value and `gcd`, the new value of `max_divisor` will either stay the same or be updated to `gcd`.

The other variables (`gcd`, `i`) are not affected by this assignment. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the possible values of `max_divisor` in relation to `gcd`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is the maximum of its previous value and `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
