To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that:
1. Their sum equals `n`.
2. Their greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximal.
3. If no such sequence exists, we should return `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
The code first checks if `n < k`. If this condition is true, it prints `-1` since it's impossible to create a sequence of `k` strictly positive numbers that sum to `n`. 

Next, it attempts to build a sequence `seq` by iterating from `1` to `k`, adding the current index `i` to the sequence and subtracting `i` from `n`. If at any point `n` becomes less than `i`, the loop breaks, and it checks if the length of `seq` is equal to `k`. If it is not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `n` is equal to `k`, the only possible sequence is `1, 2, ..., k`, which sums to `k` and is valid.
2. If `n` is less than `k`, it correctly outputs `-1`.
3. If `n` is greater than `k`, it may not necessarily produce a sequence with maximal GCD. For example, for `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the code will produce `1, 2, 3` which has a GCD of `1`. However, a better sequence would be `2, 3, 5` which also sums to `10` and has a GCD of `1`. There are cases where the GCD could be higher, but the current logic does not account for that.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe a function that calculates the GCD, but they do not provide any insight into the actual sequence generation logic. The hints do not address whether the generated sequences meet the GCD maximization requirement.

### Conclusion:
The code fails to ensure that the generated sequence has the maximal GCD, especially when `n` is greater than `k`. It does not explore potential sequences that could yield a higher GCD. For example, with `n = 10` and `k = 3`, while `1, 2, 3` is valid, a sequence such as `2, 3, 5` would also be valid but isn't generated by the code. 

Thus, there are valid cases where the code does not meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
