Output State: **If `b` is greater than 0, the loop will execute until `b` becomes 0. At the end of the loop, `a` will hold the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `n` and `k`, and `b` will be 0. If `b` is initially 0, the loop does not execute, and `a` retains its initial value (which is `n` or `k`).**
