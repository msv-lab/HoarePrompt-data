According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (or truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is equal to `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. 

Since `b` is the result of `a % b`, it will be zero if `a` is a multiple of `b`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `a` must not be a multiple of `b`, which means `a` must be adjusted such that `a % b` is non-zero. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `a` is not equal to `k * b` for any integer `k`. 

State: **`a` is `b` and `b` is not equal to 0**
