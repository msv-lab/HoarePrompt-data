Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1. If `remainder` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that no further processing will occur.***
