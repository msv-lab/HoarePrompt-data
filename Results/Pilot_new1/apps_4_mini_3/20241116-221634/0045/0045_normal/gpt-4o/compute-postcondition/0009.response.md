The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, and the remainder is equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
