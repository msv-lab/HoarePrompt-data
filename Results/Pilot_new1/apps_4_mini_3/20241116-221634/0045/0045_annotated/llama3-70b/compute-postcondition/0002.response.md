The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` swaps the values of `a` and `b`, with `b` receiving the value of `a % b`. Given that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the modulo operation will yield a non-negative result. 

1. The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, which is the remainder of the division of `a` by `b`.
2. The variable `a` is then assigned the previous value of `b`.

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, after the operation:
- `b` will be updated to a new value that is less than `b` (unless `b` is 0, which it cannot be since both are positive).
- `a` will take on the value of the original `b`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` after the operation.

Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is `a % b` which is a positive integer less than `b`**
