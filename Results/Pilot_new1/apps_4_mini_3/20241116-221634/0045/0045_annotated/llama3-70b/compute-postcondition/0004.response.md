The values of `a` and `b` are being swapped. The new value of `a` will be the original value of `b`, and the new value of `b` will be the result of `a % b`, which is a positive integer less than the original value of `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is `a % b`, where `a % b` is a positive integer less than the original value of `b`**
