To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code logic step by step:

### Problem Description:
1. Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence must be maximized.
3. If no such sequence can be formed, output -1.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n, k)` performs the following steps:
1. It calculates `min_sum`, which is the minimum sum required to form a sequence of the first `k` positive integers: \( \text{min_sum} = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \).
2. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to create such a sequence.
3. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, it calculates a base sequence where each element is scaled by \( d = \frac{n}{\text{min_sum}} \).
4. It then tries to distribute any remaining value (the difference between `n` and the sum of the initial sequence) across the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Key Points from Annotations:
- The annotations state that if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function correctly returns -1.
- The code constructs a sequence that is strictly increasing since it starts from 1 up to `k` and scales it by `d`.
- The loop adjusts the last elements of the sequence to account for any remainder.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case where `n` is less than `min_sum`:**
   - The program correctly returns -1.

2. **Case where `n` equals `min_sum`:**
   - The program will return the sequence [1, 2, ..., k], which is correct.

3. **Case where `n` is greater than `min_sum`:**
   - The program scales the sequence by `d` and adjusts for the remainder. However, the adjustment might not guarantee that the GCD is maximized.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not ensure that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximized. For example:
- Consider `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The minimum sum is 6 (1 + 2 + 3). The program would return the sequence [2, 4, 6] (if `d = 2`), which has a GCD of 2. However, the maximum GCD could be 3 (yielding the sequence [3, 6, 3] which is invalid as it is not strictly increasing). The program does not account for the possibility of distributing the values in a way that maximizes GCD effectively.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically in maximizing the GCD of the sequence. Thus, it does not fully align with the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
