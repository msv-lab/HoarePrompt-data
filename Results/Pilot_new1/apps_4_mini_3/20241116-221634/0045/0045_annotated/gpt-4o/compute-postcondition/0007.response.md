According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range for `i` is defined from `k - 1` down to `0`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is also a positive integer, we can conclude that `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will begin at `k - 1`. Therefore, the state must reflect that `i` is initialized to `k - 1`. Since `sequence` is defined based on `d`, which is derived from `n` and `min_sum`, it can be assumed that `sequence` is a list of at least `k` elements, provided `k` is positive.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted to indicate that `k` is at least 1 and `i` is initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of size `k`, `i` is `k - 1`**
