The code creates a list called `sequence` using a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over a range of `k` and generates values based on the previously calculated value of `d`. Each element in `sequence` is calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. 

The variable `d` is previously calculated as `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The output of the list comprehension will be a sequence of `k` elements, starting from `d * 1` up to `d * k`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing `d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`**
