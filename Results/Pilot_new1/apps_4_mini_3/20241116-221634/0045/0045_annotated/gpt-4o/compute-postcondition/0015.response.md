Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`. If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the current conditions for the loop have been satisfied. If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the program continues executing without breaking.***
