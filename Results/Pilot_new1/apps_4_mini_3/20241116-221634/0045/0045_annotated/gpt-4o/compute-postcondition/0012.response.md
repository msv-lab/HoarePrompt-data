The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and since `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are defined, the new value of `remainder` will be `n - d * min_sum - 1`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
