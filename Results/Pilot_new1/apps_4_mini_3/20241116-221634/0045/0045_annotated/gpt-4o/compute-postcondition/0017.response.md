The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, so after execution, `remainder` will be `n - d * min_sum - 2`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
