Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, and `i` is -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the conditions for the loop have been satisfied. If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the program continues executing the subsequent code without breaking.***
