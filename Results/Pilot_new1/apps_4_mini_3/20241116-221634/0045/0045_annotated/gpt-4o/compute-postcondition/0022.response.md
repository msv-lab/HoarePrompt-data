The code decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, which will now be `n - d * min_sum - 3` after the operation. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 3`, `i` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 3`, `i` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**.
