According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `m`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and it must still be less than `m`. 

There are no changes needed for `r`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b` since they remain unchanged based on the provided conditions.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 3**
