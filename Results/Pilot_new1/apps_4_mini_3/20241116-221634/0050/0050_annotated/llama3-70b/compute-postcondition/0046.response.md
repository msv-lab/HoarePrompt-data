Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with two lists `s` and `b`. It calculates the total number of shares that can be bought with the initial amount `r` based on the buying prices in list `s`. If shares are acquired, it then updates the amount `r` by adding the value obtained from selling those shares at prices in list `b`. Finally, it prints the remaining amount `r`. If no shares can be bought, `r` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
