Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 greater than `i`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list, `b` is a sorted list in reverse order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`, `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks, and no changes are made to `shares`, `r`, or `i`. Additionally, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `shares` would have been increased by `r // s[0]` and `r` updated to `r % s[0]` before breaking, but this only applies in the case where the loop was not entered.***
