To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code snippet `shares += r // s[i]` given the initial state.

1. The variable `i` is `i + 1`, which means it has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
2. The variable `s` is a sorted list, and since `i` is now `i + 1`, `s[i]` will access the element in the list at the index `i + 1`.
3. The variable `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
4. The operation `r // s[i]` performs integer division of `r` by the value of `s[i]`.
5. The result of `r // s[i]` will be added to `shares`.

Since the exact values of `r`, `s`, and `shares` are not provided, we can't compute specific numerical results, but we can describe the effect.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 greater than `i + 1`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list, `b` is a sorted list in reverse order, `i` is `i + 1`, and `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`.**
