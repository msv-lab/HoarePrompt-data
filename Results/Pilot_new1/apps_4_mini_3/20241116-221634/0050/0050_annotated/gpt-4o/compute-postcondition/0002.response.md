The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means that `b` will contain integers derived from a space-separated string input. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `b` being a list of integers, while the other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input**
