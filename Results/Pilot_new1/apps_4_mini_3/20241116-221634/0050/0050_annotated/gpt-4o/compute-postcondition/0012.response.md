Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which is then printed. This ensures that all potential cases, including when the lists `s` and `b` are empty or contain the same values, are appropriately handled.***
