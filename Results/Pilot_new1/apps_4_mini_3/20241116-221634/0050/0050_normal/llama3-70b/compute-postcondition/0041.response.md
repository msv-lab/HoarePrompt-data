Postcondition: ***`shares` is the total number of shares bought, `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[2]` if `shares` is greater than 0. If `shares` is 0 or less, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `r`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the update to `r` when `shares` is positive. Additionally, `m` is greater than 2, and `i` is 2.***
