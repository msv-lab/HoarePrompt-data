Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[1]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` unchanged. Additionally, edge cases where `r` equals `s[1]` or `r` is less than `s[1]` are also considered in the outcomes.***
