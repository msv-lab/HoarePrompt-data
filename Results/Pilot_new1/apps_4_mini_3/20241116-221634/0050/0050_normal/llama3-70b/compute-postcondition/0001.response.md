The variable `s` is assigned a list of integers created by mapping the `int` function over the input values provided by the user. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged, while `s` now holds a list of integers based on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`, along with the new value of `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` remains unchanged**.
