The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of steps needed to reach a certain condition based on the difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we can derive the values.

- `x - y` is always a positive integer since `y` is less than `x`.
- The expression `//` (integer division) gives the quotient, while `%` gives the remainder when dividing by 2.

Since `x` and `y` are updated based on input values, we will denote `d = x - y`. The output will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`, but we can express the output state in terms of `d`.

The output state will be as follows:

Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated based on input values, with `d = x - y`, and the output is `(d // 2) + (d % 2)`**.
