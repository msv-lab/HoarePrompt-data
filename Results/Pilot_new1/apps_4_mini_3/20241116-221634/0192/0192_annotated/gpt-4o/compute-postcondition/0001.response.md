To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet step by step. The code calculates a value based on the integers `x` and `y`, which are constrained such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\).

The expression `print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)` computes the following:
1. Calculate the difference \(x - y\).
2. Perform integer division of this difference by 2, which gives the number of complete pairs of the difference.
3. Calculate the remainder of the difference when divided by 2, which will be either 0 or 1.
4. Add the results of the integer division and the modulus operation.

Since `x` and `y` are integers within the specified range, this computation will yield a specific integer result based on the values of `x` and `y`.

As the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, the output state will include the relationship between `x` and `y`, and the result of the computation will be represented as a function of the difference \(x - y\).

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output of the print statement is (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
