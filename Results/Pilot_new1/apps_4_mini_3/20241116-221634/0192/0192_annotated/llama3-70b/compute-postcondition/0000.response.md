The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided through `map(int, input().split())`. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), the exact values of `x` and `y` will depend on the input given. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are assigned input integers satisfying the condition \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\).

Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned input integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
