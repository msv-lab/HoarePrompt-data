The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input` accepts two integers separated by a space. The conditions specify that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. The values of `x` and `y` will be updated according to the input, but the specific values are not known. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now defined by the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers defined by the input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
