To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function and its logic.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of seconds needed to transform an equilateral triangle of side length \( x \) into another equilateral triangle of side length \( y \). The operations allowed involve decreasing the side lengths while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., the lengths must be positive integers).

### Given Code
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Code Explanation
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers \( x \) and \( y \) from the input.
2. **Computation**: The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` computes the number of seconds required to reduce the triangle from side length \( x \) to side length \( y \).
   - The term `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many complete pairs of side length reductions can be performed.
   - The term `(x - y) % 2` accounts for an additional second if there is an odd difference between \( x \) and \( y \).

### Correctness Check
Now, let's evaluate whether this logic correctly implements the requirements of the problem:

1. **Understanding the Transformation**: 
   - The goal is to reduce the side lengths from \( x \) to \( y \). Each operation can reduce one side length, so the total number of operations should account for how many units we need to decrease.
   - The maximum side length can only be reduced to \( y \) while ensuring that at least two sides remain at least \( y \) during the process.

2. **Example Cases**:
   - For \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \):
     - The difference is \( 6 - 3 = 3 \). The program calculates \( (3 // 2) + (3 \% 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is incorrect since it takes 4 seconds to reach (3, 3, 3).
   - For \( x = 8 \) and \( y = 5 \):
     - The difference is \( 8 - 5 = 3 \). The program calculates \( (3 // 2) + (3 \% 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is incorrect since it takes 3 seconds to reach (5, 5, 5).
   - For \( x = 22 \) and \( y = 4 \):
     - The difference is \( 22 - 4 = 18 \). The program calculates \( (18 // 2) + (18 \% 2) = 9 + 0 = 9 \), which is incorrect since it takes 6 seconds to reach (4, 4, 4).

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds required for all cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the need to ensure two sides remain at least \( y \) during the transformation process. 

Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
