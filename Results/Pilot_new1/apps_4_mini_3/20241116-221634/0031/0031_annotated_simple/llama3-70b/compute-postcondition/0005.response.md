The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The initial value of `total_days` is \(2^n\) and the initial value of `denominator` is 1. Therefore, after executing the code, `denominator` will be \(1 \times 2^n = 2^n\). The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 0**
