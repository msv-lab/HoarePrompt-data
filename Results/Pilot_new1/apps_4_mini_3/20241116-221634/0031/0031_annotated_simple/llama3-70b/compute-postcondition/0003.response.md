According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer within the range 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, as `k` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, `i` needs to be initialized to 0, as that is the starting index for the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
