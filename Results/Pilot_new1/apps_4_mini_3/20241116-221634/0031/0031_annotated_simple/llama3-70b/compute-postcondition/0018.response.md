The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function body, it returns the result of the expression `(numerator % (10))`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the result of the modulo operation on the numerator with respect to 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and returns the result of (numerator % 10).**
