Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. Otherwise, there are no actions taken in the else part, and the function does not print or return any value.***
