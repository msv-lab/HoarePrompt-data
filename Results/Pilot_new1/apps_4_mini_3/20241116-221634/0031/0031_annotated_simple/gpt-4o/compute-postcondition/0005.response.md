The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to \(2^n\). Since the initial state does not provide the specific values of `n` and `k`, we cannot determine if `k` is greater than \(2^n\) or not. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `total_days` without any other actions taken. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and `total_days` is \(2^n\)**
