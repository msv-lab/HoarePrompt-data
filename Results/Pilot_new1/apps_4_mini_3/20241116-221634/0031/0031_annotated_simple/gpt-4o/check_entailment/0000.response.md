To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its logic against the requirements outlined.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The logic is correct and follows the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The first check is whether `k` is greater than `2^n`. If this condition is true, the function prints `(1, 1)` and returns. This is correct because if there are more people than days, at least two people must share a birthday.
   - It calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`.
   - It initializes `numerator` and `denominator` to `1` and uses a loop to calculate the number of ways to choose `k` people with unique birthdays. The numerator accumulates the products of available days, while the denominator accumulates the total possible combinations.
   - After the loop, the program calculates the probability of shared birthdays using the formula: `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
   - It then reduces the fraction `A/B` by dividing both by their GCD and prints the result modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **When `k` is equal to `2^n`**:
   - This is a special case where there are exactly as many people as days. The program should correctly identify that there will definitely be shared birthdays. The current logic handles this because it checks if `k > 2^n` and returns `(1, 1)` if `k` exceeds `2^n`.

2. **Large Values of `n` and `k`**:
   - The constraints allow `n` and `k` to be as large as `10^18`. The program uses bitwise operations and modular arithmetic to handle these large numbers. However, we need to ensure that the calculations do not lead to overflow or incorrect behavior due to Python's handling of large integers.

3. **When `k` is `2` and `n` is `1`**:
   - This case should yield a probability of `1/2`, which should be correctly computed as `1 2` after reduction.

4. **When `n` is `1` and `k` is `2`**:
   - The output should be `1 2` (because there are only 2 days and 2 people). If `k` were `3`, it would return `1 1`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, I have not found any case where the program does not meet the problem description. The logic appears to correctly calculate the probability of shared birthdays and print the results in the expected format.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description and computes the required probabilities accurately.
