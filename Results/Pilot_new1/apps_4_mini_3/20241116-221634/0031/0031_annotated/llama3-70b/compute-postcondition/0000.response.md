The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which means it is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the value of `total_days` will be \(2^n\). The variable `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\); `k` is an integer between 2 and \(10^{18}\); `total_days` is \(2^n\).

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n**
