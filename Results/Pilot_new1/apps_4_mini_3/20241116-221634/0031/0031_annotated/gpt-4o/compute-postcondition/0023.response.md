The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, which was previously assigned the value of `denominator`. The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_shared`, and `A` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `p_no_shared` is assigned based on `k`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, and `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned based on `k`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total**
