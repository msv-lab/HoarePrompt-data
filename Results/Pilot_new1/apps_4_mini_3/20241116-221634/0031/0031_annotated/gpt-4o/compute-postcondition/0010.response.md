The variable `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is equal to `2^n`. Thus, the new value of `denominator` becomes `(1 * total_days) % MOD`, which simplifies to `total_days % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is equal to `total_days % MOD`, `denominator` is equal to `total_days % MOD`, `i` is 0**
