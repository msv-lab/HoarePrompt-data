According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least twice. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `k-1` during the iterations. 

Given the initial state, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, which does not affect the execution of the loop. The relevant states for the loop to execute are the values of `k` and `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2 and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
