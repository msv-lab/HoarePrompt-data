The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The value of `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, but since we do not have specific values for `p_total`, `p_no_shared`, or `MOD`, we cannot determine the exact value of `A`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment without specific values. 

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned based on `k`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; A is assigned the value of `p_shared`.**
