The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints (1, 1) and terminates without returning a value. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the function does not print anything and simply exits. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the comparison of `k` with `2^n`, it either prints a specific output or exits without any output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than `2^n`, it prints (1, 1) and terminates. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it exits without printing anything.**
