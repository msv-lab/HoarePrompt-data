According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times, provided that `k` is at least 1. Given that `k` is in the range of 2 to 10^18, it is guaranteed that `k` is greater than or equal to 2. 

At the beginning of the loop, the variable `i` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `k - 1`. Since `k` is guaranteed to be at least 2, the loop will execute at least once, and `i` will take on the values from 0 up to `k - 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to reflect the initial value of `i` before the loop starts. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
