Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If it is, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates certain values (`numerator`, `denominator`, `p_shared`, and `p_total`) based on the product of `total_days` and prints the reduced fraction of `p_shared` over `p_total`, modulo `10^6 + 3`. The function does not return any value explicitly, and its main output is through printed results.**
