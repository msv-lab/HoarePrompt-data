The variable `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Since `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), the new value of `denominator` will be \(1 \times 2^n\), which simplifies to \(2^n\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \(2^n\), `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \(2^n\), `i` is 0**
