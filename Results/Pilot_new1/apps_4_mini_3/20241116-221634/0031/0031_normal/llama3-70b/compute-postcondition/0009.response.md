According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 2, and `k` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n \times (2^n - 1)\), `denominator` is \(2^{2n}\), `i` is 2**
