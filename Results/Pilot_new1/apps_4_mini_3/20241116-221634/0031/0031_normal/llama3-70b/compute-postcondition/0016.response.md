The value of `denominator` is modified by dividing it by `gcd`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, the new value of `denominator` will be `denominator` divided by `gcd`. The value of `numerator` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is reduced by the factor of `gcd`; `denominator` is \(2^{nk} / gcd\); `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
