The function accepts two non-negative integers as input, represented as strings, removes any leading zeroes from both, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first is less than the second, and '>' if the first is greater than the second. Note that the function does not return any values; it only prints the comparison result.
