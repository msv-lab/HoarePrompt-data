Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', and `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the output is '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. Additionally, if `b` was initially empty, it is treated as '0' in the comparisons, ensuring that all cases are accounted for based on the relative values of `a` and `b`.***
