Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros, and their lengths are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. Additionally, if `b` was initially empty, it is treated as '0' in the comparisons, ensuring that all cases are accounted for based on the relative values of `a` and `b`.***
