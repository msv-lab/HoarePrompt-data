Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where both input numbers are zero correctly. If the input is:

```
0
0
```

The expected output should be `=` since both numbers are equal. However, the program will strip the leading zeros and treat both `a` and `b` as empty strings, which will then be set to '0'. The subsequent comparisons will yield `=` correctly, but the logic for checking equality is not explicitly tested against the case of both being zero after stripping. 

Additionally, if the input contains only leading zeros, such as:

```
000000
000000
```

The program will also correctly output `=`. However, the handling of leading zeros could lead to confusion since it relies on the stripping logic without an explicit condition for equality before and after stripping.

Thus, while the program may work for most cases, it does not clearly demonstrate correctness for the edge case of both numbers being zero or all zeros. Therefore, it is incorrect.
