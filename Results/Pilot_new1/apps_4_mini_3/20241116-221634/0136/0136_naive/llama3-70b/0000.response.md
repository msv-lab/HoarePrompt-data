Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the comparison of very long integers that may have leading zeroes. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the lengths of the stripped strings (after removing leading zeroes) can be directly compared to determine the order of the original integers. 

For example, consider the input:
```
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

After stripping leading zeroes, the program will compare:
```
a = '1'
b = '0'
```
This will correctly output `>` which is expected. However, if the inputs were:
```
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

After stripping leading zeroes, the comparison would yield:
```
a = '0'
b = '1'
```
This will output `<`, which is also expected. 

However, the issue arises when both numbers are equal after stripping leading zeroes, but one of them had leading zeroes. For instance:
```
Input:
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```
Both strings would become `a = '0'` and `b = '0'`, and the output would be `=` which is correct. 

However, consider the case:
```
Input:
000123
123
```
After stripping leading zeroes:
```
a = '123'
b = '123'
```
The output would be `=` which is correct.

The fundamental flaw is that the program does not handle the cases where the lengths of the original strings are different after stripping leading zeroes. If one number has leading zeroes that make it shorter than the other number, it should be considered smaller. 

Thus, the program fails to account for cases where leading zeroes could mislead the comparison without proper length checks. 

In conclusion, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
