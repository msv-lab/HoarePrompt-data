Postcondition: ***`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, which can be '0' if it was originally an empty string; `b` is '0' if it was empty or retains its original value without leading zeroes. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the program compares `a` and `b`: the output is '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. All comparisons correctly handle cases where either `a` or `b` could be '0' or empty strings, ensuring proper handling of leading zeroes and equality.***
