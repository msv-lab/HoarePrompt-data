The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can contain up to 10^6 digits. The function processes these inputs and returns the sum of the two numbers as a string, ensuring that the result is also in string format without leading zeroes (unless the result is zero). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns their sum as a string.**
