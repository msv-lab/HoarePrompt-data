The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes in the input string will be removed. The initial state indicates that `a` is an input string with leading zeroes removed, but `b` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer string. Therefore, after this operation, `b` will now hold the new input value with leading zeroes stripped. The value of `a` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the new input string with leading zeroes removed**
