Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed; if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; `b` is a non-empty string; `a` is lexicographically less than `b`; and the output is '<'.**
