Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'. `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed; if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. Therefore, after execution, `b` will always be a non-empty string, either the original value of `b` or '0' if it was empty.***
