Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and `b` is a non-empty string. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is determined by lexicographical comparison: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if they are equal, the output is '='. All cases are handled, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the relationship between `a` and `b`.***
