To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is `n % 10`, and `remainder` is less than or equal to 5.

1. The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, which gives the last digit of `n`.
2. Since `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, it can take values from 0 to 5.
3. The code snippet assigns the value of `result` as `n - remainder`.

Now, since `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`, we can express `result` as follows:

- If `remainder` is 0, then `result = n - 0 = n`.
- If `remainder` is 1, then `result = n - 1`.
- If `remainder` is 2, then `result = n - 2`.
- If `remainder` is 3, then `result = n - 3`.
- If `remainder` is 4, then `result = n - 4`.
- If `remainder` is 5, then `result = n - 5`.

Thus, the value of `result` will depend on the specific value of `n` and its last digit (the value of `remainder`).

Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship between `n` and `result` based on the calculated `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is `n - remainder`.**
