To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The specifics are:
1. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it should remain unchanged.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it should round down to the nearest multiple of 10 if the last digit is 0 through 5, or round up to the nearest multiple of 10 if the last digit is 6 through 9.

### Examples:
- Input: `5` → Output can be `0` or `10` (both are correct).
- Input: `113` → Output should be `110`.
- Input: `1000000000` → Output should be `1000000000`.
- Input: `5432359` → Output should be `5432360`.

### Annotations in the Code:
The annotations describe the behavior of the function:
- If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n`.
- If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.

### Code Analysis:
Let's analyze the code step by step:
1. The function reads an integer `n`.
2. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 10:
   - If true, it prints `n`.
3. If `n` is not a multiple of 10:
   - It checks if the last digit (remainder of `n` when divided by 10) is less than or equal to 5:
     - If true, it prints `n - n % 10` (rounding down).
   - If false (last digit is greater than 5), it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)` (rounding up).

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **For n = 5**: The output can be either `0` or `10`. The program rounds down to `0` which is acceptable as per the problem description.
2. **For n = 6**: The program would round up to `10`, which is correct.
3. **For n = 15**: The program would round down to `10`, which is correct.
4. **For n = 14**: The program would round up to `20`, which is correct.
5. **For n = 0**: The program will output `0`, which is correct.
6. **For n = 1000000000**: The program will output `1000000000`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the rounding logic as specified in the problem description. The annotations align with the expected behavior of the function, and all edge cases considered do not reveal any discrepancies. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
