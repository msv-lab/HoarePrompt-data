The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, but the exact value is unknown as it is determined by user input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is now an input integer**
