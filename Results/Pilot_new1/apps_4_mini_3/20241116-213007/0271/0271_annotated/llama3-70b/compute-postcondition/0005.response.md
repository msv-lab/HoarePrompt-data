The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively rounds down `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, not a multiple of 10, and the remainder when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the result of `n - n % 10` will be the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. 

Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n % 10` will be a value between 1 and 5 (inclusive). Therefore, `n - n % 10` will yield a value that is `n` minus a number between 1 and 5, resulting in a multiple of 10.

The output state will indicate the value of `n` and the calculated result, which is `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the result of `n - n % 10` is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.**
