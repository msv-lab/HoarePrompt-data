To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided.

1. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9.
2. The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`.
3. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is assigned the value `n - remainder`, rounding `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10.
4. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is assigned the value `n + (10 - remainder)`, rounding `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10.
5. Finally, the code prints the value of `result`.

Since the value of `n` is not explicitly provided, we cannot calculate a specific value for `result`. Instead, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is either `n - (n % 10)` if `n % 10` ≤ 5 or `n + (10 - (n % 10))` if `n % 10` > 5.**
