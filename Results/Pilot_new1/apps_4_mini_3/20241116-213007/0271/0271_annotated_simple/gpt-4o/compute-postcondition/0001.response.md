The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^9. Therefore, the possible values for `remainder` will be between 0 and 9, inclusive. The state of other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` (which is between 0 and 9)**
