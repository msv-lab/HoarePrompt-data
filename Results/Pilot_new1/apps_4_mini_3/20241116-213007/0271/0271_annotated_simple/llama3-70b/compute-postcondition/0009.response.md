Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is divisible by 10, then `n` is printed. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n` (i.e., `n - n % 10`) is printed. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` (i.e., `n + (10 - n % 10)`) is printed. This covers all possible values of `n` within the specified range, including edge cases where `n` is 0 and where `n` is 10^9.***
