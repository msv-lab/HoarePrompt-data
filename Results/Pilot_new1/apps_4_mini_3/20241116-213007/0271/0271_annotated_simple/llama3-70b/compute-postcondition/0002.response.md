The code prints the value of `n`. The value of `n` is an integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and is divisible by 10. Since the print statement does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `n` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10; `n` has been printed.**
