The value of `n` is printed as `n - n % 10`. Given the constraints, `n` is an input integer not a multiple of 10, and the remainder when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. This means that `n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 5. Therefore, `n - n % 10` will effectively round `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10.

For example, if `n` were 7, then `n % 10` would be 7, and `n - n % 10` would be 0. If `n` were 23, then `n % 10` would be 3, and `n - n % 10` would be 20. 

Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, the output will be the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the output is `n - n % 10` which is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.**
