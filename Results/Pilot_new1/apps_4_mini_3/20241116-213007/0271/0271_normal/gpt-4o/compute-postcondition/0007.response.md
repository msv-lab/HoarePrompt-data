To determine the output state, we need to analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. The variable `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`. Depending on the value of `remainder`, we calculate the variable `result` as follows:
- If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is equal to `n - remainder`.
- If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is equal to `n + (10 - remainder)`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(result)
```

Since the code prints `result`, we need to include the value of `result` based on the value of `n`. However, without a specific value for `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the conditions and calculations based on the initial state of `n`, but we cannot specify a concrete value for `result`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is calculated based on the value of `remainder`, which is `n % 10`**.
