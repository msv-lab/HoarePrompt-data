To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
Vasya has a non-negative integer `n`, and he wants to round it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded. The rounding rules imply that if the last digit (`n % 10`) is 5 or less, we round down; if it's greater than 5, we round up.

### Program:
```python
n = int(input())
remainder = n % 10
if remainder <= 5:
    result = n - remainder
else:
    result = n + (10 - remainder)
print(result)
```

### Output Hints:
The output hints explain that the function rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the last digit. If the last digit is 5 or less, it rounds down; if it's greater than 5, it rounds up.

### Analysis:
1. **Rounding Down**: When `remainder <= 5`, the program correctly computes `result` as `n - remainder`, which rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10.
2. **Rounding Up**: When `remainder > 5`, the program computes `result` as `n + (10 - remainder)`, which rounds up to the next multiple of 10.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, the output should be 0, which the program correctly handles.
   - If `n` is exactly a multiple of 10 (e.g., 10, 20, 100), the program will also return `n`, which is correct.
   - If `n` is 5, the program will round down to 0, which is one of the valid outputs as stated in the problem description.

### Validation Against Output Hints:
The output hints agree with the logic of the code:
- The program correctly identifies the last digit and applies the rounding rules.
- It accounts for all potential cases as described in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The code adheres to the problem description for every potential case, handling all specified edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
