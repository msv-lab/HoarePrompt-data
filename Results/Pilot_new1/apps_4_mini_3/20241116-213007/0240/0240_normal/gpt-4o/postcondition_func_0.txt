The function accepts a string `s` composed of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the occurrences of characters in `sub`. Then, it generates possible numbers from these remaining characters and returns the smallest number among them. If `sub` contains characters not present in `s`, the function may not handle this case explicitly, potentially leading to unexpected results. Additionally, if there are no remaining characters after subtraction, the function could raise an error when trying to find the minimum.
