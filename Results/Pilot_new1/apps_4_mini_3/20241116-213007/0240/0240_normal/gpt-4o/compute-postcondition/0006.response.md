The variable `candidate` is assigned the value created by joining the elements of `perm`. The value of `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, which means `candidate` will be a string formed from this permutation. The other variables (`chars` and `sub`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string created by joining `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string created by joining `perm`**.
