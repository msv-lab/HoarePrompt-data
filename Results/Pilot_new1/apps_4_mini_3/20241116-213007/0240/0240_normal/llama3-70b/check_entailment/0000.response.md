Let's analyze the provided problem description and the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a string `s` that has been shuffled, and a substring `t` that is part of `n`. The integer `n` is formed by characters in `s` that are also in `t` followed by `t`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
s = input()
t = input()
print(func_1(s, t))

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)
```

1. **Input Handling**: The code takes two inputs: `s` (the shuffled string) and `t` (the remembered substring).
2. **Set Creation**: `t_set` is created to contain unique characters from `t`.
3. **Character Selection**: The code iterates over `s`, appending characters to `n` if they exist in `t_set`.
4. **Appending `t`**: After constructing `n` from characters in `s`, it appends `t` to `n`.
5. **Return Value**: Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Edge Cases:
- If `s` contains no characters that are in `t`, the resulting `n` would only consist of `t`. This is valid as per the description.
- If `s` consists entirely of characters not in `t`, the output would be just the integer value of `t`. This is also valid.
- The code does not account for leading zeros in `s` when forming `n`. If `s` has leading zeros and `t` is not empty, the integer conversion will remove those leading zeros, which could affect the smallest possible integer `n`.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that the function constructs `n` by including characters from `s` that are also in `t`, and then appends `t` to `n`. It also mentions that if `s` is empty or contains no characters found in `t`, the function will return the integer value of `t`. This aligns with the code logic.

### Conclusion:
The code does not handle the situation where leading zeros could affect the smallest integer output. For example, if `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", the function would construct `n` as "30021", which is correct. However, if `s` were "000" and `t` were "1", the function would return `1`, which is valid but does not reflect the smallest integer that could be constructed from `s` and `t`.

However, the main issue arises when the code does not ensure that the digits selected from `s` are arranged in a way that forms the smallest possible integer. The characters from `s` should be sorted before appending `t` to ensure the smallest possible value.

### Final Assessment:
Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically regarding the formation of the smallest integer), the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The code fails to ensure that the digits from `s` are arranged to form the smallest integer `n`. An example case where it fails is if `s = "3210"` and `t = "10"`, leading to a non-minimal integer output.
