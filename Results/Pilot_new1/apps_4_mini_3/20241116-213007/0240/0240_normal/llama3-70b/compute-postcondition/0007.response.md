The value of `n` is assigned the value of `n` concatenated with `c`. Since `n` is initially an empty string and `c` is the second character of `s`, after execution, `n` will be equal to `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 2 characters, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, `n` is `c`, and `c` is the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 2 characters, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, `n` is `c`, and `c` is the second character of `s**
