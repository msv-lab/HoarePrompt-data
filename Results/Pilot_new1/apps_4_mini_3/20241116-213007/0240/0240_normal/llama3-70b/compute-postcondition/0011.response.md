Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 3 characters, `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`, and `c` is the third character of `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, a TypeError occurs due to incompatible types in the operation `n += c`, as `c` is a string and cannot be directly added to `n`. There is no else part in the code.***
