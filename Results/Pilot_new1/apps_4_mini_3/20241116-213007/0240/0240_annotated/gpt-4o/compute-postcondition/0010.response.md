The value of `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in `perm` into a single string. The initial state indicates that `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, so `candidate` will now hold that specific permutation as a string. The state of `chars` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
