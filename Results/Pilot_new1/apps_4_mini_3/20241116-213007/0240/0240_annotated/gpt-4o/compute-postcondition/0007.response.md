The code uses the `yield` statement, which is used in generator functions to produce a value and pause the function's execution, allowing it to be resumed later. The variable `candidate` is yielded, which means its value is returned to the caller of the generator. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables and the fact that `candidate` has been yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
