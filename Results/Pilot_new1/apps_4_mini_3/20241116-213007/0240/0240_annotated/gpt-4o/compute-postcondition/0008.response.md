Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, no value is yielded, but the state of `candidate` remains unchanged.***
