The function accepts a string `chars` of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits, and it generates all possible permutations of `chars`. It yields each permutation as a valid candidate if it passes the validation check defined by the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, no candidates are yielded, and if `chars` contains only one character, it yields that single character if it is valid; otherwise, it yields nothing. The function does not actually insert `sub` into `chars`, contrary to what the annotations suggest.
