The value of `c` is the third character of the string `s`. Since `c` is a character, we need to convert it to an integer before adding it to `n`. The impact of the code is that `n` is incremented by the integer value of `c`. The state of `s` remains unchanged, and `c` is used to adjust `n`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing at least 3 digits, `c` is the integer value of the third character of `s`, `n` is adjusted accordingly**
