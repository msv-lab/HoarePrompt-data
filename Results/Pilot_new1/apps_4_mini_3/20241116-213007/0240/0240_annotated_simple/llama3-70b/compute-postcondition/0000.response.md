The variable `t_set` is assigned a set containing the unique characters from the string `t`. Since `t` is a non-empty string, `t_set` will contain at least one character, and it may include leading zeroes if they are present in `t`. The state of other variables, including `s`, remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a string containing digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`.**
