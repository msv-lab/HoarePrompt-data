Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` by concatenating characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, and then appends `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string. If `s` contains no characters from `t`, the function will still append `t` to `n`, which may lead to returning an integer representation of `t`. If `s` is empty, the function will return the integer value of `t`.**
