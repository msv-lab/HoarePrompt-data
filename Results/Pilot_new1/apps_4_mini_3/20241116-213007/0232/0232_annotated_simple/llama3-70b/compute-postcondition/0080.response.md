Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, which indicates that the current window contains the desired counts. If this condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking out of the loop. Additionally, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1 (or initialized to 1 if `color` was not previously a key), ensuring the current color count is updated.***
