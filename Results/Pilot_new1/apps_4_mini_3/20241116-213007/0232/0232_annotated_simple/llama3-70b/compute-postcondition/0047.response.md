Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the sorted values of `color_counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged.***
