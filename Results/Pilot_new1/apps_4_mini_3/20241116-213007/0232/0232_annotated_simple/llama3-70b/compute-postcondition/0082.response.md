Output State: **`found` is True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, indicating that the desired counts have been achieved; otherwise, `found` remains False. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop executes, incrementing `j` from `i` to `n-1`, and `window_counts[color]` is updated based on the colors encountered. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, `found` remains False, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` remains empty.**
