Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop if the counts of elements in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. This occurs under the precondition that `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or has been incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, the program continues without modifying `found`.***
