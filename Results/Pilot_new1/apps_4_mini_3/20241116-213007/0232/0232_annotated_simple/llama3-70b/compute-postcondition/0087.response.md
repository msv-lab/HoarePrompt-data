The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of `found` and `n` are not affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `found` and `n`, along with the new state of `window_counts`.

Output State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
