Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and `color` is the first element of `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added as a key with a value of 0, leaving the rest of the variables unchanged.***
