Output State: **`found` is True if a match is found between the sorted values of `window_counts` and `counts` during any iteration; `window_counts` contains counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `j`, where `j` is the current index in the loop; `i` remains unchanged; `j` is incremented from `i` to `n-1` with each iteration; if `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, and `i` is unchanged.**
