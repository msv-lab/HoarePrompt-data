Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from the `colors` list and values are their respective counts. If `colors` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each integer in `colors`, incrementing the count for each color. If `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`.**
