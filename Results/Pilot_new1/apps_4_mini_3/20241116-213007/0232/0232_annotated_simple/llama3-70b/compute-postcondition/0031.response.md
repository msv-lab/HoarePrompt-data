Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding sorted values in `counts`, indicating a successful match of color counts; `i` is 0; `j` is 0; `color` is the first element of `colors`; and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the program continues executing beyond this point.***
