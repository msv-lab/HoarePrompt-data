Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts of the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the counts do not match, the loop continues without modifying `found`.***
