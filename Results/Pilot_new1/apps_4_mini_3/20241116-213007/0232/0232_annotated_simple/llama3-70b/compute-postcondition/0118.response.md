Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `n` remains greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is between `i` and `n-1`. If `found` is False, the program does not execute the block, leaving `found` as False and `window_counts` as an empty dictionary, indicating that no matching count of colors was found.***
