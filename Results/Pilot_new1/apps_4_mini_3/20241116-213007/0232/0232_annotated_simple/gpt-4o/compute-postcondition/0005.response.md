Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑(k[i]) ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the values in `k`, `current_counts` is updated with `current_counts[colors[right]]` incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and for every color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` equals `desired_counts[color]`***
