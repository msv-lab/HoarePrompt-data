Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑(k[i]) ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the values in `k`, and at least one `current_counts[color]` is now greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]` for some color in `desired_counts`. If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If not all counts match, the function does not return any value.***
