The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, so now `found` changes to `True`. The other variables (`window_counts`, `i`, `j`, `color`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `found` is True; `i` is n; `j` is n; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. 

Output State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `found` is True; `i` is n; `j` is n; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]**
