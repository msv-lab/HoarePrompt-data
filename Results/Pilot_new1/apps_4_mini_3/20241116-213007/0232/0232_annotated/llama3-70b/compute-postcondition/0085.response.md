Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the counts of each unique `color`. If `found` is True, the loop is exited, and `i` is `n - 1`, while `j` is equal to `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is undefined. If `n` is greater than 0 and the loop executes, the state of `found` will determine whether the loop is exited or continues.***
