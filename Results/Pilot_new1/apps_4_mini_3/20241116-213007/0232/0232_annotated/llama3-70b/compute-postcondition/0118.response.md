Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts` when sorted. If `n` is 1, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from index 0 to 0 in the `colors` list, and `i` and `j` are defined. If `n` is 0 or less, `window_counts` is empty, `found` is False, and `i` and `j` remain undefined.***
