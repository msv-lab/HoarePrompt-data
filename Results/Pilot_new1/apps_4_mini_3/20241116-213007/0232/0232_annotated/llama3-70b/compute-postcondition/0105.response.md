Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1. If the counts of the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If they do not match, `found` remains False, while `i` and `j` remain unchanged at n.***
