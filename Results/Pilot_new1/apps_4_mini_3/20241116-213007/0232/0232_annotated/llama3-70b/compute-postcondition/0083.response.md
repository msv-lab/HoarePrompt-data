Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the counts of each unique `color` encountered from index `i` to `n-1` in the `colors` list. The values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted. `found` is True. `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is defined as the starting index of the loop, which is equal to `i`.***
