Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
