Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1, `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `n` is greater than 0. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition does not hold, `found` remains unchanged, and no changes are made to `window_counts`, `i`, `j`, or `n`.***
