The code initializes `color_counts` as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the previous values of `n`, `m`, or `counts`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new state of `color_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
