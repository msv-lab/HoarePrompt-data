The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`found`, `i`, `j`, `n`). The previous state of `window_counts` is now replaced with an empty dictionary. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `window_counts` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is n - 1, `j` is undefined, `n` is greater than 0**
