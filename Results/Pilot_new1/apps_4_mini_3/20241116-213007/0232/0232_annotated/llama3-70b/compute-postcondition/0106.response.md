According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and both `i` and `j` remain unchanged at `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`, and the condition must allow `j` to be less than `n`.

State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1, `found` is False, `i` is n, `j` is n**
