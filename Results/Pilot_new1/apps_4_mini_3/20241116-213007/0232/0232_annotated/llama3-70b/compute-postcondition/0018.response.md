Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary that maps each unique color in `colors` to the number of times it appears, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and if `colors` is an empty list, then `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `colors` contains at least one color, the loop executes for each color in the list, updating `color_counts` accordingly.**
