The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1, so after execution, `window_counts[color]` becomes 2. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j`. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j`.

Output State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j**
