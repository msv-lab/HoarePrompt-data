The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. Since `color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`, and it was initialized to 0 if it was not already present in `window_counts`, the new value of `window_counts[color]` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`found`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1; `found` remains False; `i` is n; `j` is n.

Output State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1; `found` remains False; `i` is n; `j` is n**
