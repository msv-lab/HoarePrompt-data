Output State: **If the loop executes, `current_counts` will reflect the counts of colors processed up to `right`, and `left` will be the number of iterations executed to adjust counts when the conditions are met. If the loop does not execute (when `current_counts` does not meet the condition for the loop to start), `left` remains 0 and `current_counts` remains unchanged. If at any point all counts in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function will return 'YES'.**
