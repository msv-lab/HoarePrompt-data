Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in the `colors` list, and `color_counts` is a dictionary where `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if `color` was already in `color_counts`, or initialized to 0 if it was not present before the execution of the program fragment.***
