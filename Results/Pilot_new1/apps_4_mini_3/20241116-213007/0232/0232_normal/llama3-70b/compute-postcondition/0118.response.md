Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the count of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `n-1` to `n-1`. If `found` is True, the most internal loop is exited, and `color_counts` remains unchanged, with both `i` and `j` set to `n-1`. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being empty, `found` remaining False, `color_counts` unchanged, and both `i` and `j` still equal to `n-1`.***
