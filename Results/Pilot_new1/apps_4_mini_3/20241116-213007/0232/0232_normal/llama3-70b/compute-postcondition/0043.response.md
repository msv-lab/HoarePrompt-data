Postcondition: ***`colors` is non-empty, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0; otherwise, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
