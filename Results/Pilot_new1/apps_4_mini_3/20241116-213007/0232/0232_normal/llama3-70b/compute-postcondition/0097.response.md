Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has the key `color` with a value of either `1` or incremented by `1`. If the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. Otherwise, `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, and `j` is `n-1`.***
