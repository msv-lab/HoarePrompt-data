Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, then `colors` is non-empty, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors` starting at index `i` up to `n`, and these counts match the target counts. If `colors` is empty or `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty, `found` being False, and `color_counts`, `i`, and `n` remaining unchanged.***
