Postcondition: ***`colors` is non-empty, `color` is the next element of `colors`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `j` is incremented by 1, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to `found`, `color_counts`, `i`, or `n`.***
