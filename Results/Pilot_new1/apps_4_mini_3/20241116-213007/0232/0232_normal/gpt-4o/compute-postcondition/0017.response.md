The code updates the `current_counts` array by incrementing the count of the color corresponding to the index `right`. The value of `right` is `n-1`, and `colors[right]` retrieves the color at that index. The previous values of `left` and `right` do not affect this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `left` is at its current value, `right` is `n-1`, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`left` is at its current value, `right` is n-1, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
