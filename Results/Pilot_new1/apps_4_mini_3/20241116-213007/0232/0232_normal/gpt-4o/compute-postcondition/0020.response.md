According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right`. The loop runs for `right` in the range of `n`, which means it will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `right` variable needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`, which is outside the range of the loop.

No other states need to be adjusted as `left` and `current_counts[colors[right]]` do not affect the continuation of the loop.

State: **`left` is at its current value, `right` is n + 1, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
