Output State: **If all values in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts` for all colors, the function returns 'YES' and `left` is incremented accordingly until it reaches the point where the loop condition fails. If `current_counts` does not match `desired_counts`, the loop continues until `left` reaches the point where no further increments can be made. If the initial state of `current_counts` is such that it does not satisfy the loop condition from the start, the loop does not execute, and `left` remains 0, with no return value.**
