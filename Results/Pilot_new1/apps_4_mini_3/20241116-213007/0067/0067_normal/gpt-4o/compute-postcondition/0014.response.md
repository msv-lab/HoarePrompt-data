The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates on internal logic based on the constraints provided, which state that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since no parameters are passed to the function, we cannot determine specific return values based on the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined without additional context on how `x`, `y`, and `z` are utilized or set within the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is undetermined without further context on the usage of x, y, and z.**
