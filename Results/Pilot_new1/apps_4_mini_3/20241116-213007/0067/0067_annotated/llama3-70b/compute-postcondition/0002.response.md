The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '+'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '+'.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '+'**
