The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of `y` and `z` are based on user input, but they are integers. Therefore, the value of `max_downvotes` will be the sum of the integers `y` and `z`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on user input, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`**
