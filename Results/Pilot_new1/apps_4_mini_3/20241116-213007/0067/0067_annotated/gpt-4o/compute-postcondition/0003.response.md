The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, which is an integer based on user input. The previous values of the affected variables are: `x` is an integer based on user input, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment.

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on user input, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
