The code snippet `print('?')` will print the character `?` to the output. None of the variables (`x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, `max_downvotes`) are modified or affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on user input, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the printed output is '?'**
