The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are based on user input. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be the sum of the user-provided values for `x` and `z`. The state of `min_upvotes` remains unchanged at the value of `x`. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on user input, `y` is an integer based on user input, `z` is an integer based on user input, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**
