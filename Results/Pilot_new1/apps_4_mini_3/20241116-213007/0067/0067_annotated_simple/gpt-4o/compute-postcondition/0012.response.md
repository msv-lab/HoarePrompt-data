Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'; otherwise, the output is '?'. Given that `max_upvotes` is at least equal to `min_downvotes`, the logic ensures that all scenarios where `max_downvotes` is compared to `min_upvotes` are covered, including edge cases where `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes`.***
