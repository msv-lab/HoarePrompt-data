Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the output is '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'; otherwise, the output is '?'. This covers all scenarios, including edge cases where `max_upvotes` equals `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes`.***
