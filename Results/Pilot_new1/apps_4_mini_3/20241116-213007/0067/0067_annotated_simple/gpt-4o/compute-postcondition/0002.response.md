The value of `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are based on input, but since we don't have the specific values, we can only state that `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`. The previous values of `min_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer based on input value; `y` is an integer based on input value; `z` is an integer based on input value; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer based on input value; `y` is an integer based on input value; `z` is an integer based on input value; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`; `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`**
