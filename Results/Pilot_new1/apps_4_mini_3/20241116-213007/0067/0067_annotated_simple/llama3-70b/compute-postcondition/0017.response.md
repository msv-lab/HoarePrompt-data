Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the output is '0' if `z` is 0; otherwise, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, the output is '?'. Throughout the execution, the condition that `x` is less than or equal to `y + z` remains satisfied.***
