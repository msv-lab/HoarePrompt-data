Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string moving towards the center. It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, `False` if it is not a palindrome, and does not explicitly handle the case of a single character string, which is considered a palindrome by definition. Thus, for a single character string, the function implicitly returns `True`. **
