Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop checks pairs of characters from the start and end of the string `s` moving towards the center. If any characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal, the function returns False. If the loop completes without returning, the characters at all checked indices are equal. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns None, indicating that `s` is trivially a palindrome.**
