The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
