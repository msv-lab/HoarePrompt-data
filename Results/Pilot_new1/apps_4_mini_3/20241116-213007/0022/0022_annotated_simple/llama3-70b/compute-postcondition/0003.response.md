According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is at least 1, which means that `n` must be at least 2. Given that `s` is a string with a length between 1 and 1000, the minimum length for the loop to execute is 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will take values starting from 0 up to `n // 2 - 1`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
