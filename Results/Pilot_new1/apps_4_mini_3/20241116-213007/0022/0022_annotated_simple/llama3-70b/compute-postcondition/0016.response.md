According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 5. Therefore, `n // 2` will be at least 2 (since 5 // 2 = 2). 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3 in the next iteration. Since `n` is at least 5, `n // 2` will still be at least 2, allowing the loop to continue.

No other states need to be adjusted, so the only necessary adjustment is for `i`.

State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 5, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 3**
