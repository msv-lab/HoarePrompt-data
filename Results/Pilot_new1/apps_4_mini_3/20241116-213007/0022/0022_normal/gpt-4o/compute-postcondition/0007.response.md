Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function does not return anything, indicating that this specific condition has been satisfied.***
