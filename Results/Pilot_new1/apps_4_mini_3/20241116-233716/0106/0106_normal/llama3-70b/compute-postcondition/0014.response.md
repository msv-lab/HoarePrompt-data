Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters directly but reads integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from input. It computes the minimum time required to move between two positions `a` and `b` in a grid defined by `n`, `m`, and `k`. It calculates the block and floor positions for both `a` and `b`, then computes the time to move between blocks and floors. However, if `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the function attempts to calculate `min_floor_time`, which may lead to an undefined state if `b_floor` is not properly defined. The function ultimately prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`, but there is a risk of an error due to potential undefined values. **
