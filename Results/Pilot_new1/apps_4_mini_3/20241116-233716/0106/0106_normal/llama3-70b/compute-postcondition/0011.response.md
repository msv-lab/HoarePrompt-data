Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is undefined; if `b_floor` is undefined, then `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10, but since `b_floor` is undefined, this scenario cannot occur. Otherwise, if `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` remains undefined due to `b_floor` being undefined. Thus, in all cases, `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated.***
