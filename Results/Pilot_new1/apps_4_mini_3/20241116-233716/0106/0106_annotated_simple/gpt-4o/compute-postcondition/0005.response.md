Functionality: ** The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the block and floor number based on the given formulas, where `m` and `k` are assumed to be predefined integers that determine the structure of the apartment layout. It returns a tuple containing the calculated values of `block` and `floor`. However, the code does not handle potential cases where `m` or `k` could be zero, which would result in a division by zero error. Therefore, the function's behavior is undefined if `m` or `k` are not set to valid positive integers. **
