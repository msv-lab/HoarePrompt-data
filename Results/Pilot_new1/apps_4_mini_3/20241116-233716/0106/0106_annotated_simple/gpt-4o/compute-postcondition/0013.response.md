The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, it returns the total time calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return a calculated total time based on the provided inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, and returns the total time calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5.**
