Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of apartment `a`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of apartment `b` which is not defined; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`**
