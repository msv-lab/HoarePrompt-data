The variable `total_time` is assigned the value of the expression `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`. However, `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` cannot be calculated because `min_walk_time` cannot be determined due to the undefined value of `block_b`, and `time_to_target_floor` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `floor_b`. Therefore, the values of `total_time` and other related variables remain undefined.

Output State: **`total_time` is undefined due to the undefined values of `min_walk_time` and `time_to_target_floor`.**
