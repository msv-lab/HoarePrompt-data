The code calculates `min_walk_time` as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. However, since `block_b` is not defined, `reverse_walk_time` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the value of `min_walk_time` cannot be determined as it relies on an undefined variable. The output state remains unchanged for the defined variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` is defined; `block_b` is not defined; `reverse_walk_time` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `block_b; min_walk_time` cannot be determined.**
