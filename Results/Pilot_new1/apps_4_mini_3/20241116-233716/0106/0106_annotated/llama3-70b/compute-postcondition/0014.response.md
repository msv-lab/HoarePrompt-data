Functionality: ** The function accepts input values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are positive integers representing constraints, and two other integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to move from floor `a` to floor `b` considering both block transitions and floor transitions, and prints the total time. The function does not handle any input validation, so it assumes the inputs are correctly formatted and within specified ranges.**
