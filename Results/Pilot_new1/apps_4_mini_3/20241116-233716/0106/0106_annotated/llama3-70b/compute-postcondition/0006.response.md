The value of `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, and `n` minus that absolute difference, multiplied by 15. The values of `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n` are known, while `b` is unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `min_block_time` based on the known values and the relationship with `b_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers from input; `a` is an input integer; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`**
