The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated using the formula `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The values of `b_floor` and `a_floor` are known from the initial state, but `a_floor` is not explicitly provided. However, it is stated that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`. 

Since `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, we can infer that `b_floor` is a positive integer. The formula for `min_floor_time` involves multiplying the difference between `b_floor` and `a_floor` by 5 and then adding 10.

Given that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, this means that the difference `(b_floor - a_floor)` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `min_floor_time` will be a positive integer or 10 at the minimum (if `a_floor` equals `b_floor`).

The output state will reflect the calculation of `min_floor_time` based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10**
