The variable `a_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers from input, and `a` is also an input integer. The previous values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are not specified, but since they are positive integers, we can calculate `a_block` based on this formula. The state of `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers from input; `a` is an input integer; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
