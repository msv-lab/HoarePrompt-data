To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic it implements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Apartment Layout**: The apartments are organized into `n` entrances, each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments. 
2. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered sequentially from 1 to `n * m * k`.
3. **Movement Time**:
   - Going up or down one floor takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving from one entrance to the next takes 15 seconds.
   - Using the elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor.

### Code Analysis
The function `func_1` calculates the minimum time for Edward to get from apartment `a` to apartment `b` based on the following steps:
1. **Get Locations**: The function `get_location` determines the entrance (block) and floor for a given apartment number.
2. **Time to Exit**: If Edward is not on the first floor, it calculates the time to take the elevator down to the first floor.
3. **Walking Time**: It calculates the time to walk directly or in reverse to the target entrance.
4. **Time to Target Floor**: Finally, it calculates the time to walk up to the target floor.

### Potential Issues
1. **Elevator Usage**: The code does not consider the scenario where Edward is already on the first floor but still needs to use the elevator to reach a higher floor, which should not incur the elevator waiting time if he is already on the first floor.
2. **Floor Calculation**: The calculation of `time_to_target_floor` does not account for the scenario when Edward needs to go down to reach Natasha's floor after walking to her entrance.

### Example Case
Letâ€™s consider a specific case:
- For `n = 1`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`, `a = 2`, `b = 1`:
  - Edward is in entrance 1, floor 2.
  - Natasha is in entrance 1, floor 1.
  
In this case, Edward can simply walk down one floor, which should take 5 seconds. However, the current implementation would calculate a time of 10 seconds (waiting for the elevator) plus 1 second (going down) which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
Since there exists at least one case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
