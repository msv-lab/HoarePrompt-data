Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balances based on the string `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is equal to 0.***
