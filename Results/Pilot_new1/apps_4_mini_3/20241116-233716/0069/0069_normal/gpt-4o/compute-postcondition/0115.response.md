Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` is already accounted for. If `balance` is 0 and `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, and 0 is appended to `results`, indicating that `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this value of `count` is appended to `results`. In all scenarios, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` remain unchanged.***
