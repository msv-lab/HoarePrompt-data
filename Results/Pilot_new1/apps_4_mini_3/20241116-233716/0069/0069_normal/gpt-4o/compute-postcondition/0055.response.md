According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 (since `prefix_balances[3]` was updated based on `prefix_balances[2]`), and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the character `s[2]`, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4**
