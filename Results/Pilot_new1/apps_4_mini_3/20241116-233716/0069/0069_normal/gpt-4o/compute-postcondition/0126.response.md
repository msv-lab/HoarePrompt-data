The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, constrained such that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
- `n` is a positive integer that represents the length of the binary string `s`, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `x` is an integer that can take values in the range of \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The function processes these inputs and returns outputs based on the specified conditions and relationships. However, the exact output behavior is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (number of test cases), n (length of binary string), x (an integer), and s (a binary string), and processes these inputs according to defined constraints.**
