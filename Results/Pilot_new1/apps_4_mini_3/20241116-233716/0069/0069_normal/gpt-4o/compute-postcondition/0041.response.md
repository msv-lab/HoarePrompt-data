Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to `n`, and if `balance` is 0, then if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`, otherwise 0 is appended. If `balance` is not 0, the count of valid indices in `prefix_balances` where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is calculated and appended to `results`. In the case where `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, and the same logic for appending values to `results` applies.***
