The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. Since the previous values of `results` are not provided, we can only state that `-1` is added to it. Other variables such as `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `T`, `x`, `s`, and `index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer that exists in `prefix_balances`, `s` is a string, `index` has been increased by 3, and `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
