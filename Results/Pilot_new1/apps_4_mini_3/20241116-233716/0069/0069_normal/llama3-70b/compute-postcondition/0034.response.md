Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is assigned the value `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is an integer. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the output will be -1 since this leads to a division by zero when checking `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the output will be -1. Otherwise, the output will be the integer result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, reflecting the adjusted value based on the balance of counts while avoiding any division by zero errors.***
