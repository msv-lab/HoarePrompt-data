Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and the balance is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the division is only performed when `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero, and the conditions regarding the relationship between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` are maintained throughout.***
