Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s', `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s', `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `T` is greater than 1. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is valid as long as `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero. Note that the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` should be handled separately to prevent undefined behavior.***
