Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `T` is greater than the number of completed iterations. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is a positive integer, assuming `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero.***
