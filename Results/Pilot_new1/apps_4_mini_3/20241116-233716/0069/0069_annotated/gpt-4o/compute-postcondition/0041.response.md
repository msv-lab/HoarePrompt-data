Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` indicates the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1; if `x` is not present, `results` is updated to include 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` holds true, and `results` is updated to include this `count`. The integrity of `prefix_balances` and the value of `balance` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
