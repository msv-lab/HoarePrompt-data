According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, it must also be adjusted to ensure it is greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be 2.
- `n` should be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
