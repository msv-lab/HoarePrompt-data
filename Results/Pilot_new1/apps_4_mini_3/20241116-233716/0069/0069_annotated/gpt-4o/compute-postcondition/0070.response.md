The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is incremented regardless. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are also equal to 0; `balance` is not equal to 0; `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are also equal to 0; `balance` is not equal to 0; `count` is incremented by 1.**
