Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element initialized with zeros, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, and (x - b) is divisible by `balance` with a non-negative quotient.**
