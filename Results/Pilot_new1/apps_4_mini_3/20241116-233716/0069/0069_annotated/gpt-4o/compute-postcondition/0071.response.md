Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are also equal to 0; `balance` is not equal to 0. If the difference between `x` (which is the value being compared) and `b` (which is 0) is divisible by `balance` and the quotient is non-negative, then `count` is incremented by 1. If the difference is not divisible by `balance` or the quotient is negative, `count` remains unchanged.***
