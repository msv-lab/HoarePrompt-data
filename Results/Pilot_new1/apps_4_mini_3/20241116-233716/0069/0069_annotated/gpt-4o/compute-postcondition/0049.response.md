According to the code, the loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, the variable `n` must be at least 1, which means `prefix_balances` must have a length of at least 2 (since it has `n + 1` elements). At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` will be `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` starts at 1, and `prefix_balances[1]` is initialized to 0.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
