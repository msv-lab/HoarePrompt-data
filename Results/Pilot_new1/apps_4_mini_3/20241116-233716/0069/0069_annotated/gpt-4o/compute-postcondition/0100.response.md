Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative count up to index `i`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains as initialized with all zeros.***
