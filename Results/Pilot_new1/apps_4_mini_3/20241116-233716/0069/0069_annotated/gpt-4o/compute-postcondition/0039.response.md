Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true; `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`. If `balance` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `count` remains 0. If `prefix_balances` is empty or if `n` is less than 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0.**
