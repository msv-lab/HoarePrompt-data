The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 2, we are looking at `s[1]`. The value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` (which is `prefix_balances[1]`) is used in the calculation. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` evaluates to either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[1]` is '0' or not.

1. If `s[1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `prefix_balances[1] + 1`.
2. If `s[1]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `prefix_balances[1] - 1`.

The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `s` are not explicitly provided, but we know that `prefix_balances[i]` will be updated based on the value of `s[1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the dependency on `s[1]` and the update to `prefix_balances[i]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `s[1]`; `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
