Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements initialized with zeros, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3. If `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` with a non-negative quotient, then `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
