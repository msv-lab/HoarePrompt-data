Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are also equal to 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `b` is 0, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
