Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' up to the i-th position in the string `s`; `balance` is 0; the loop has executed `n` times if `n` is at least 1; `results` now contains an additional element `0`.**
