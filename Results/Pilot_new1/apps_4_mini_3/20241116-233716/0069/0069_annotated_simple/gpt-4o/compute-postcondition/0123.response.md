The code executes a print statement that outputs the value of `result`. The value of `result` is the third output in the list `results`, which is not specified but is assumed to exist based on the initial state. The values of `T` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `results` contains at least 3 outputs, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, and the function prints the value of `result`.

Output State: **`results` contains at least 3 outputs, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, and the function prints the value of `result`**.
