The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is determined by the list `data` and the value of `index`, which is 1. Hence, `x` will take the integer value of the element at position `index + 1` in the `data` list. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is now the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of input strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
