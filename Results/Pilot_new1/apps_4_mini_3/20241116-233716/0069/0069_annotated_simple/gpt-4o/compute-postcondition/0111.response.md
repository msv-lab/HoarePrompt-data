Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2`, `count` remains unchanged unless `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, in which case `count` is increased by 1. This means that if the difference between `x` and the first element of `prefix_balances` (denoted as `b`) is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains the same.***
