According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list contains more outputs, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 1 output, indicating that there was at least one item processed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least 2 outputs, and `result` should be the next output in the list. Since `results` contains at least 1 output, we can adjust the state to reflect that it now contains at least 2 outputs. The specific value of `result` should also be adjusted to the next output in the list.

State: **`results` contains at least 2 outputs, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, `result` is the second output in the results**
