Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, containing cumulative balances based on the number of '0's and '1's in the first `i` characters of string `s`. The variable `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's is balanced up to the current index. The value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `1`.***
