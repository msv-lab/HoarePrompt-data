Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `balance` is 0, indicating that the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are equal. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` has an element appended with -1. Otherwise, `results` has an additional element `0`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `1` filled with zeros.***
