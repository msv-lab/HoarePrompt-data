The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`, and `count` is increased by 1**
