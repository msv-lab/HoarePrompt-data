Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` has `-1` appended to it. Otherwise, `results` has `0` appended to it. This accounts for the case where `prefix_balances` is empty or `x` does not exist within it.***
