The value of `count` is initialized to 0. The variable `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, and since there are no operations affecting other variables, the output state reflects the current state of `count` and the condition of `prefix_balances`. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with the final value reflecting the imbalance, and `count` is 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[n]` reflects the imbalance; `count` is 0**
