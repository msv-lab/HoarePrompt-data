Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which the difference `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. If `prefix_balances` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `balance` is 0, the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` will lead to a division by zero error, which should be handled separately.**
