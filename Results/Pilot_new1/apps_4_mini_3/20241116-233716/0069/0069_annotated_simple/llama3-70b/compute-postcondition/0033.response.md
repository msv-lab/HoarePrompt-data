Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string with counts `cnt0` of '0' and `cnt1` of '1', and `balance` is defined as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special handling may be needed as division by zero would occur, which should be considered in the context of the problem.***
