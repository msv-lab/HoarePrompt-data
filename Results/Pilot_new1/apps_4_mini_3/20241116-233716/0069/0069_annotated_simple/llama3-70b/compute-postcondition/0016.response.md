The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, where `input()` accepts two integers separated by a space and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, and `T` is a separate variable that is greater than 1, but its value is not directly affected or modified by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `x` from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer from input, `T` is greater than 1**
