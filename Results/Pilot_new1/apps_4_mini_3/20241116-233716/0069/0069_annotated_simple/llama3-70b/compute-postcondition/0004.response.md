The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The state of the other variables (`n` and `x`) is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`**
