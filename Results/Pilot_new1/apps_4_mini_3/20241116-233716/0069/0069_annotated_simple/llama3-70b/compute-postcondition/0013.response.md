Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1, accounting for the cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, which would lead to a division by zero if not handled properly, as well as ensuring that `balance` does not equal `x`.***
