Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`; and the program prints -1.**
