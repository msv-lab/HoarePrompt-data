Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer from input, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program handles the division appropriately, and if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the value `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed, ensuring all cases are covered, including the potential division by zero scenario.***
