The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, changing its previous value from `False`. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, `x`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is `True`, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the first element in `assigned`, with the difference between `a[i]` and `x` being an element in `assigned`.
