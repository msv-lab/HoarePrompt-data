The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, and this assignment changes its state. Other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`**
