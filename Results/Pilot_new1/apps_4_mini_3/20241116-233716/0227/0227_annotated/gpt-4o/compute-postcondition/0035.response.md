Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, and `assigned` contains at least one more element. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the program continues without changing `can_form`, `m`, or the contents of `assigned`.***
