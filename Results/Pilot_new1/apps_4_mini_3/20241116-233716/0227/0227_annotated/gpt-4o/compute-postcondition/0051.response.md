The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `a[2]`, and the difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and `x` is in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
