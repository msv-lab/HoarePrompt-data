Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, indicating that either there does not exist an element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, or `assigned` contains fewer than 2 elements. If `n` is at least 2, `assigned` contains distinct positive integers, and the loop will not execute.***
