The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23. The specific values of `a` are not provided, but the sorting operation will arrange the integers in increasing order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the state of `a` is updated to reflect the sorted order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers**
