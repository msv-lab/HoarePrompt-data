The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input integer that satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The list `a` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers**
