According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which means the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase to 2. Since `m` is incremented to 2 if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, and remains 1 otherwise, we need to ensure that `i` is now 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` needs to be updated to 2 for the next iteration.
- `m` remains unchanged as it does not directly affect whether the loop can run again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 2**
