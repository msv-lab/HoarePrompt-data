The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer in the list satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the output is determined based on the values of `n` and `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers and perform operations or return results based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list a of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9).**
