Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, and no changes are made to the other variables.***
