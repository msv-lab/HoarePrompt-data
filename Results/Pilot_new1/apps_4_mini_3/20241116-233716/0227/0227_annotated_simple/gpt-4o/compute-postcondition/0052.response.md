Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. The values of `m` and `i` remain unchanged at 3, and `n` remains greater than 3. The variable `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and `assigned` contains the element `a[i]`.***
