Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, and `x` is the third element in `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, `can_form` remains True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, there is no change to `can_form`, and the execution continues without breaking.***
