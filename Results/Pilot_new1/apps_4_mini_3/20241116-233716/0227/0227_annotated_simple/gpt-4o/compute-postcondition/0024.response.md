Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, if `can_form` is False, the integer `m` is increased to 2. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is 2. If `assigned` contains only one element, `can_form` is determined based on the condition, and if it is False, `m` is increased to 2. The values of `i` remain at 1, `n` is at least 2, and `assigned` now includes the element `a[i]`.**
