The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is now `True`, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `assigned` contains the element `a[i]`, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`.
