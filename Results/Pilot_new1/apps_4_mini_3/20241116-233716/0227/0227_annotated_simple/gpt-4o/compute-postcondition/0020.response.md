Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains only one element, the loop executes once, and `can_form` is determined based on the condition. `assigned` is a list containing the elements processed so far, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.**
