Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased to 3, while `i` remains 2 and `n` is at least 2. This situation occurs when `assigned` is either an empty list or contains only one element, which prevents the loop from executing. If `can_form` is True, the value of `m`, `i`, and `n` remains unchanged.***
