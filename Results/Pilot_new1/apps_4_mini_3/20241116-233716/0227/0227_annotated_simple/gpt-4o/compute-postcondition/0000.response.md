The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers. Since the values in `a` are distinct and fall within the specified range, sorting will rearrange them without any changes to their distinctness or range. The output state reflects the sorted order of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[k]` ≤ 10^9.**
