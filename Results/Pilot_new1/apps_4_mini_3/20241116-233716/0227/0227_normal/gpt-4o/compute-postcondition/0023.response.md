Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, indicating that either `assigned` is empty or every element in `assigned` fails to satisfy the condition that for every `x` in `assigned`, there exists no `a[i]` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `can_form` is True, then `m` remains unchanged.***
