Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `assigned` includes at least 2 elements, `m` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 3, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`. If the expression `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the value of `can_form` remains unchanged.***
