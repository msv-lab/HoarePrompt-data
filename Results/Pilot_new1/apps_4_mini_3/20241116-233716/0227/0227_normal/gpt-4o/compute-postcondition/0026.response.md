The value of `can_form` is assigned to `False`, changing its previous state (which was either `True` or `False`). The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, and `n`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2**
