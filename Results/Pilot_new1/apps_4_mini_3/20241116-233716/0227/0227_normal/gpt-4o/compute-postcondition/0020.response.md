Output State: **`can_form` will be True if there exists at least one `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` is found after iterating through all elements in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. Therefore, if `assigned` contains only `a[0]`, `can_form` will also remain False since `a[i] - a[0]` cannot exist in `assigned`.**
