The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `assigned` includes at least 2 elements, `m` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
