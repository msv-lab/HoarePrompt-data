The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` can either be 2 or 3, after the operation, `m` will either be 3 or 4. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 2**
