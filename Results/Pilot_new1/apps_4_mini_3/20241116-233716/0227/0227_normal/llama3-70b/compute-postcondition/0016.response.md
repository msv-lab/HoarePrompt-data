The code checks the value of `m` and prints `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. Given the initial state, we know that `m` can be between 1 and `n`, where `n` is at least 1. 

- If `n` is 1, `m` is 1, which is less than or equal to 23, so it prints `m`.
- If `n` is at least 2, `m` can range from 1 to `n`, and since `m` can be at most `n`, it can still be less than or equal to 23, depending on the specific value of `n`.

Since we do not know the exact value of `n`, we can conclude that `m` is at least 1 and can be up to `n`, which is at least 1. Therefore, `m` will be printed since it will not exceed 23 in the given conditions.

Output State: **`m` is at least 1 and can be printed, depending on its value; if `m` is greater than 23, -1 will be printed.**
