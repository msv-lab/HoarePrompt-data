The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list are not equal to twice the previous element, starting with a count of 1. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), nor does it check for invalid input types, which could lead to runtime errors.
