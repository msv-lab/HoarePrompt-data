The code appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. Therefore, after this operation, `r_queue` will contain the value of `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is equal to `n`; `r_queue` now contains the value of `n`; `v` is undefined**
