The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, which is within the range of 0 to 199,999 since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The state of the other variables (`votes` and `v`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n - 1`; `v` is `votes[n - 1]`, and `r_queue` now includes the value `i` (which is `n - 1`).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n - 1`; `v` is `votes[n - 1]`, and `r_queue` now includes `i` (which is `n - 1`)**
