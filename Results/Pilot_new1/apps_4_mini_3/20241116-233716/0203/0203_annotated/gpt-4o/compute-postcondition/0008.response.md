The code appends the current value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, and `r_queue` is an empty list. After executing the code, `r_queue` will now contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is [0]; `i` is 0; `v` is the first character of `votes`, and `v` is not equal to 'D'.**
