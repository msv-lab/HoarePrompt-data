Output State: **If `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty and the loop does not execute. If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are both non-empty, the loop will execute until at least one of the queues is empty. After `n` iterations, if `d_queue` is not empty, it will contain indices that are the original indices of 'D' characters plus multiples of `n`, while `r_queue` will contain indices that are the original indices of 'R' characters plus multiples of `n`. If `d_queue` becomes empty during execution, the loop stops, and if `r_queue` becomes empty, the loop also stops. If both queues are initially empty, then neither will change.**
