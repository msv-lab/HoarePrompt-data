Postcondition: ***`votes` is an empty string, `d_queue` is non-empty containing indices of 'D' characters plus multiples of `n`, and `r_queue` is either empty or non-empty containing indices of 'R' characters plus multiples of `n`. The loop has executed at least once, and `d_queue` remains non-empty.***
