The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes by maintaining two queues for the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters. The function continues to compare and manipulate these indices until one of the queues is empty. Ultimately, it prints 'D' if there are remaining 'D' votes, or 'R' if there are no 'D' votes left. If the input string `votes` is empty, 'R' will be printed since both queues will be empty. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
