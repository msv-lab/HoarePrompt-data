Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and `fractions` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the output is 'D'. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the output is 'R'. Note that if `n` is 0 or `fractions` is empty, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` would be 0, but this scenario is not possible based on the initial state.***
