According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. The loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the second character in `fractions`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `fraction` is updated to the next character in the string, which would be the third character.

Since the `fractions` string is of length at least 2, we can conclude that there is at least one more character to iterate over. Therefore, we need to adjust the `fraction` to be the third character in `fractions`, and the loop will continue until all characters are processed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length at least 3, and `fraction` is the third character in `fractions`.**
