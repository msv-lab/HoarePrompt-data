The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of employees, constrained to the range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent the affiliations of the employees. 

The function processes these inputs and returns the result based on the votes. However, the specific output behavior is not detailed in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n`, which contains characters 'D' and 'R' representing employee affiliations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string votes of length n consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters.**
