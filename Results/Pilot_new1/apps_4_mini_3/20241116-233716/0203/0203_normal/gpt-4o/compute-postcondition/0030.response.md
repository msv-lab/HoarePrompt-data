The `d_queue` has one less element, and the value of the removed element from `d_queue` is stored in `d_index`. The code appends a new value to `d_queue`, which is the result of `d_index + n`. The values of `r_queue` and `r_index` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (the value `d_index + n` added), `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.**
