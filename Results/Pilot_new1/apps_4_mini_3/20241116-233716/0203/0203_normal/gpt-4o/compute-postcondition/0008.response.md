The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so `r_queue` will now contain the value `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is now [0], and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is now [0], and `i` is 0**.
