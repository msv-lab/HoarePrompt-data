Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty, and after the loop execution, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be empty. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` will have one more element which is `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` will have one less element. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` will have one more element which is `r_index + n`, and `d_queue` will have one less element.***
