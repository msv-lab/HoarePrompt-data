According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`, since `enumerate(votes)` will iterate over indices from 0 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the next value of `i` will be 3. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and is at least 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. The character `v` will then be the fourth character of `votes`, which is at index 3.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to 3.
- `v` should be updated to the fourth character of `votes`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 3, and `v` is the fourth character of `votes`.**
