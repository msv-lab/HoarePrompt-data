The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `d_queue` will have the value 1 appended to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains the value 1.**
