The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 2, which is a constant in this context. The initial state does not provide the value of `d_queue`, but we can infer that it is a list that will now include the value of `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of `votes`, and `d_queue` now includes the value 2**.
