Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed and after the loop, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be empty. If `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged and empty after the loop. In either case, if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and both queues remain empty.***
