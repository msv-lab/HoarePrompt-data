The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The variable `votes` also remains unchanged, as it is not impacted by the initialization of `d_queue`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length n, and `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length n, and `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list**
