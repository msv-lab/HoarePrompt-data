Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 2 characters remaining, and `fraction` is the second character in the string. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased to 2 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is 'R', then `depublicans` remains 1 and `remocrats` is increased to 1.***
