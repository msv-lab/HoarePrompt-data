The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. The `r_queue` is non-empty before this operation, so after executing the code, `r_queue` will have one fewer element, and `r_index` will hold the value of the removed first element. The values of `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed, `d_index` is the removed first element, `r_queue` is non-empty with one fewer element, and `r_index` is the value of the removed first element.**
