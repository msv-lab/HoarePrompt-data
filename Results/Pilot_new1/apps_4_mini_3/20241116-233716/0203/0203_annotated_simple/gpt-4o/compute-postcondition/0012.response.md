The `r_queue` is updated by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the code, `r_queue` will contain the value [1].

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character `v` of `votes` is 'D', `r_queue` is [1], `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`**
