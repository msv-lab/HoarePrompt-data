Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, and `i` is 1. If the second character `v` of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the indices [0, 1], and `r_queue` remains empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is 'D', while `r_queue` contains [1].***
