Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character `v` of `votes` is 'D', and `r_queue` is empty. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the index 0 and `d_queue` is empty. In both cases, `i` remains 0.***
