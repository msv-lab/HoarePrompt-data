The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200000\). The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent the fractions of the employees. 

After executing the function body, the output will be determined based on the composition of the `votes` string. However, the specific return values based on the input parameters are not provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string votes of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
