The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The previous value of `i` is 2, and the state of the other variables (`n`, `votes`, `v`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the character at index 2 of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the character at index 2 of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains the value 2**.
