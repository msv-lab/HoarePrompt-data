The `r_queue` list is modified by appending the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is [0], `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`, and `v` is not equal to 'D'**.
