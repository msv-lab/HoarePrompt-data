The value of `r_index` is assigned from the removed element of `r_queue`, and `n` is a positive integer. When we execute `r_queue.append(r_index + n)`, we are adding a new element to `r_queue`, which is the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The state of `d_queue` and `votes` are not directly affected by this operation, but we note that `r_queue` will now have one more element. 

After the execution, `r_queue` will have its first element as `r_index`, followed by the newly appended value of `r_index + n`. The output state will reflect the updated state of `r_queue`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` is decreased by one element, `r_queue` has the new element `r_index + n` appended, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed element from `r_queue`, and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
