The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is known as the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and `n` is an unknown value. Therefore, the new element added to `r_queue` will be the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The states of `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `d_index` is the removed first element; `r_queue` is non-empty with one element removed; `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and a new element `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`.**
