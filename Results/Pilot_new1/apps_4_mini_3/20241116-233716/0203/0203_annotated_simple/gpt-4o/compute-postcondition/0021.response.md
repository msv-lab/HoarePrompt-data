The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The `d_queue` is not affected by this operation, and `n` and `votes` also remain unchanged. The state of `r_queue` will change as it will lose its first element. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is decreased by one element, `r_queue` has its first element removed, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.**
