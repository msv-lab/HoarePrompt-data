The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, and since its initial value is 0, the new value of `depublicans` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and the first character of `fractions` is 'D'.
