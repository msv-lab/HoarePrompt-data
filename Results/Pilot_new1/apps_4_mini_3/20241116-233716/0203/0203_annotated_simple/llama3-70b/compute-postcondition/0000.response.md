The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `fractions` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), and `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), and `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**.
