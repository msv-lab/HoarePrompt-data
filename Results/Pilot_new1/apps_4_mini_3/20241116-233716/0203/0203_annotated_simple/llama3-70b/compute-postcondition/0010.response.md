According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the string `fractions`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and we have processed the first character.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that we are ready to process the next character in the string. Since we have already processed the first character, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now at the second character of the string.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- The index of the character being processed needs to be incremented to 1 (indicating we are now at the second character).
- The remaining length of the string to process is now `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and we are at the second character of `fractions`**
