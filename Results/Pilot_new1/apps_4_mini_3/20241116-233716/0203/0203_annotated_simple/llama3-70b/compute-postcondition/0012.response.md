The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The state of the other variables, `n` and `fractions`, is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1**
