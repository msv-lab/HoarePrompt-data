To verify the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, let's analyze the code and the logic implemented.

The function `func_1(n, k)` is designed to check if the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The logic is as follows:

1. If `k >= n`, it immediately returns 'No' because the remainders for `n % k` will repeat (specifically, `n % n = 0` and `n % 1 = 0`).
2. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders that have been encountered.
3. It then iterates through each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, calculates the remainder `n % i`, and checks if this remainder has already been seen.
4. If a remainder is found to be already in the set, it returns 'No'.
5. If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

Now, let's consider edge cases and potential issues:

- When `k < n`, the function correctly checks all integers from `1` to `k`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders are `5 % 1 = 0`, `5 % 2 = 1`, and `5 % 3 = 2`, which are distinct.
- However, the function does not handle the case where `k` is very large compared to `n`. For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 10^18`, the remainders would be:
  - `1 % 1 = 0`
  - `1 % 2 = 1`
  - `1 % 3 = 1` (and so on for all `i > 1`, which will also yield `1`)
  
  This will lead to repeated remainders, but the program will not return 'No' because it only checks up to `k`, which is larger than `n`.

To summarize, the program fails to account for cases where `k` is significantly larger than `n`, leading to incorrect results when the remainders are not distinct.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where `k` is much larger than `n`, leading to potential non-distinct remainders that are not checked properly.
