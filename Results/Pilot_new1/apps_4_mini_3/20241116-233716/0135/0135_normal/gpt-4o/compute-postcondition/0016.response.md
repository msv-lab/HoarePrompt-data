The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case 2, if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the function executes a loop that runs at most `k` times, checking for unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the set of seen remainders remains empty.
- In Case 3, if none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder from the division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` is found in the set of seen remainders. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder from the division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` is found in the set of seen remainders. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.**
