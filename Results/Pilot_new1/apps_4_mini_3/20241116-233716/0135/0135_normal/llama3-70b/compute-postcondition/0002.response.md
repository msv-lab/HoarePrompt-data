According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k`. The variable `i` will take on values starting from 1 up to `k`. Since `seen` is an empty set, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
