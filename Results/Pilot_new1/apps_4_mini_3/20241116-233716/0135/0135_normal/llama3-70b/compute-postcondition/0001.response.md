The statement initializes a new variable `seen` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are input integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `seen` and the unchanged values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set**
