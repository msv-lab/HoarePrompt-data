The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function does not return any specific output as the output is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k` within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, both of which are integers within the range 1 to 10^18.**
