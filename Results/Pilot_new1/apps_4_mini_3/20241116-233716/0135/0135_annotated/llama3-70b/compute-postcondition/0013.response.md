Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is updated to `n % 2`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, the program continues executing without any output.***
