Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, from user input. It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during these calculations, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, and in such cases, it will directly print 'Yes' since the loop will not execute. **
