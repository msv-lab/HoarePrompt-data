According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. The variable `k` is greater than or equal to 1, so it must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. 

Since `k` is not specified beyond being greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be updated to 3.
- `k` should be adjusted to ensure it is at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
