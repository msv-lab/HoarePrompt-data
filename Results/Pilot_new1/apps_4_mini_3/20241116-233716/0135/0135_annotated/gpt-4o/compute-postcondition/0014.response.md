Output State: **`seen_remainders` contains unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If there exists a duplicate remainder during the loop execution, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after executing `k` times, `seen_remainders` will contain `k` unique remainders.**
