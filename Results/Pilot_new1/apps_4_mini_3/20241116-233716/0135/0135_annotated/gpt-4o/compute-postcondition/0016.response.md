The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If there exists a duplicate remainder during the loop execution, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after executing `k` times, `seen_remainders` will contain `k` unique remainders.
- In Case 3, if none of the previous cases are fulfilled, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on their values, it returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returns 'No' if there are duplicate remainders when calculating `n` modulo integers from 1 to `k`, and returns 'Yes' if none of these conditions are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returns 'No' if there are duplicate remainders when calculating `n` modulo integers from 1 to `k`, and returns 'Yes' if none of these conditions are met.**
