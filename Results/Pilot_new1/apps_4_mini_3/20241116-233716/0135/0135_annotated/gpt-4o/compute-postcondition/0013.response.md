According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to 4, and `k` remains unchanged since it is still greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 3; `i` is 4; `seen_remainders` is an empty set; `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
