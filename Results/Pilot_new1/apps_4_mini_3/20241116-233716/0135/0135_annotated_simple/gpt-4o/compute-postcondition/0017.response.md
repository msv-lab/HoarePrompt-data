Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it calculates the distinct remainders of `n % i` for `i` from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this calculation, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior since the loop would not execute. **
