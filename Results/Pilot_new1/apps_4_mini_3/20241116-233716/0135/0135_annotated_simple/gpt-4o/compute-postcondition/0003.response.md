The variable `seen_remainders` is assigned an empty set. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain as integers within the specified range. Since there is no return value from the function at this point, the output state reflects the state of the variables.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
