The loop is designed to compute the remainders of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k`, checking for duplicates in the remainders. 

1. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once, and `seen_remainders` will contain the remainders calculated during the iterations.
2. If `k` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `seen_remainders` will remain empty.

Considering the potential values of `remainder`:
- The `remainder` will be in the range of 0 to `n` (inclusive) for each `i`.
- If the same `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function will return 'No'.

Output State: **If k is at least 1, seen_remainders contains the distinct remainders of n % i for i from 1 to k. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute and seen_remainders is empty.**
