The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the output is 'No'.**
