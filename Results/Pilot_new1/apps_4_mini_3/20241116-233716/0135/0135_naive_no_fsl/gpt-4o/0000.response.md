To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The function checks if the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The key points from the problem description are:
1. We need to check if all remainders `n % i` for `i` in the range `1` to `k` are distinct.
2. If any two remainders are the same, we should return "No"; otherwise, return "Yes".

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. **Immediate Check**: If `k >= n`, the function returns "No". This is incorrect because:
   - When `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders for `i = n` will always be `0`, and for `i = 1`, the remainder will also be `0`. Thus, there will be duplicate remainders.
   - However, the function does not account for cases where `k` is less than `n`, and we should check the remainders for all values of `i` from `1` to `k`.

3. **Remainder Calculation**: The loop runs from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i` and checking if the remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns "No". Otherwise, it adds the remainder to a set.

### Missing Cases:
The program fails to consider the scenario when `k < n`:
- For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be:
  - `10 % 1 = 0`
  - `10 % 2 = 0`
  - `10 % 3 = 1`
  - `10 % 4 = 2`
  - `10 % 5 = 0`
  
In this case, the remainders are not distinct (0 appears multiple times), but the function would incorrectly return "Yes" since it only checks until `k`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly when `k < n`, it will return incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
