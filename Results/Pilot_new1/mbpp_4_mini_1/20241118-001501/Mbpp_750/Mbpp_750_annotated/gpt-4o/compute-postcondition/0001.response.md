The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. The parameter `lst` is a list, and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of the tuple `tpl` converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that combines the elements of both. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, and returns a list that is the concatenation of lst and the elements of tpl converted to a list.**
