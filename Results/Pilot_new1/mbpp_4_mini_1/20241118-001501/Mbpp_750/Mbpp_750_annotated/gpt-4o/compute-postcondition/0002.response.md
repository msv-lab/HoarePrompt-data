Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. It does not handle cases where `tpl` might be empty or where `lst` might be of a different type, but it will still return a valid list in those scenarios. **
