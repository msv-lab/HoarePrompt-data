Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirement to add a given tuple to a given list. The issue arises from the fact that the function returns a new list that is the result of concatenating the input list and the converted tuple, but it does not modify the original list in place as one might expect from the phrasing "add the given tuple to the given list."

Hereâ€™s a potential case where the program does not work as expected:

- If we have the list `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and the tuple `tup = (4, 5)`, the expected behavior might be to modify `lst` to become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. However, the function returns a new list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` without modifying `lst`.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of adding the tuple to the list in a way that reflects the intent of modifying the list itself. Therefore, it is deemed incorrect.
