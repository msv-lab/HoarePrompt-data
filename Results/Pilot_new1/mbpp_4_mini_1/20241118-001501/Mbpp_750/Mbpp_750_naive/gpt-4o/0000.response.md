Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the provided list. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates it with the original list using the `+` operator. 

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works as expected for the tested cases:
1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` correctly returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` correctly returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` correctly returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases, such as empty lists or tuples, correctly. For example:
- If `lst` is `[]` and `tpl` is `()`, it returns `[]`.
- If `lst` is `[1, 2]` and `tpl` is `()`, it returns `[1, 2]`.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and matches the problem description, the correctness is confirmed as true.
