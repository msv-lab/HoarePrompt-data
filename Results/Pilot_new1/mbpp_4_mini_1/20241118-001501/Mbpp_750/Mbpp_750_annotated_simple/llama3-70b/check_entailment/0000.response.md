Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(lst, tup)` correctly implements the requirement to add the elements of the given tuple `tup` to the end of the list `lst`. 

The logic of the function is as follows:
- It takes two parameters: a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`.
- It converts the tuple `tup` into a list using `list(tup)`.
- It then concatenates this list with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator.
- Finally, it returns the resulting list.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases:
1. If `lst` is an empty list and `tup` is a non-empty tuple, it will return a list containing the elements of `tup`.
2. If `lst` is a non-empty list and `tup` is an empty tuple, it will return the original list `lst`.
3. If both `lst` and `tup` are empty, it will return an empty list.
4. The function also handles mixed types within the tuple and list, as Python lists can contain elements of different data types.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases outlined in the problem description, the correctness is confirmed.
