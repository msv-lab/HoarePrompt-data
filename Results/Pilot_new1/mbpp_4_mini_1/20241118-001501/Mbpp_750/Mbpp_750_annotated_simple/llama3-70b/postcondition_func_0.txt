The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tup` converted to a list. It handles any valid list and tuple inputs, including empty lists and tuples, resulting in a list that contains only the elements from the non-empty input.
