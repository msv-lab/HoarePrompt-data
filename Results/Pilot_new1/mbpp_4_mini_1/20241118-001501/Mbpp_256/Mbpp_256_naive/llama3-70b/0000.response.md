Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a function that counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. The helper function `is_prime` accurately determines if a number is prime by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. The main loop iterates through all numbers starting from 2 up to (but not including) `n`, counting how many of these numbers are prime. 

Here are the key points confirming the correctness:
1. The function handles edge cases, such as when `n` is 0 or 1, where it correctly returns 0 since there are no prime numbers less than these values.
2. The prime-checking logic is sound and efficient, using the square root method for checking factors.
3. The counting mechanism correctly increments the count for each prime found.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
