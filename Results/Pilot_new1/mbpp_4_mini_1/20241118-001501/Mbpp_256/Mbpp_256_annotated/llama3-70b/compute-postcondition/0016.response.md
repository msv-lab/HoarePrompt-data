The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. Specifically, if `num` is 0 or 1, the function also returns `False`. For any non-negative integer 2 or greater, the function does not return a value initially, implying that further checks are performed to determine if `num` is prime. 

If `num` is at least 2, the function checks divisibility of `num` by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, the function does not return a value, implying that `num` may be prime.

In a separate scenario, if `num` is confirmed to be prime after all checks, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number, returning `False` for numbers less than 2 or for non-prime numbers, and returning `True` for prime numbers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or not a prime number; otherwise, it returns `True` if `num` is a prime number.**
