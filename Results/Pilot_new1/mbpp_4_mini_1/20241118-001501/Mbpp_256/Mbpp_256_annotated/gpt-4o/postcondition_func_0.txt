The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, it calculates and returns the count of prime numbers from 0 to `n`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior since the prime counting logic assumes a valid non-negative input.
