The statement `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the `is_prime` list. In the initial state, `j` is 8, and `is_prime[6]` is already set to `False`, but this does not affect the assignment to `is_prime[8]`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to `is_prime[8]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, `is_prime[6]` is False, and `is_prime[8]` is set to False**
