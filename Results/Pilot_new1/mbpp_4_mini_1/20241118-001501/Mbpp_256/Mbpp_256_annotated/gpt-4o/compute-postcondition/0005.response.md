According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and goes up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, the starting value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

- If `n` is 0 or 1, then `int(n ** 0.5)` will be 0, which means the loop will not execute since `i` starts at 2. 
- If `n` is 2 or greater, `int(n ** 0.5)` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to execute.

Since the current state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all i from 2 to n-1 if n > 1, `i` is 2**
