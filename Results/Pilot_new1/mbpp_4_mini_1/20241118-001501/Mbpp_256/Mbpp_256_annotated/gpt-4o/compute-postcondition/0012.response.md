The code sets `is_prime[j]` to False. The previous state indicates that `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, and `is_prime[j]` is currently False. This line of code does not change the state of `is_prime[j]` since it is already False, and it impacts the state of the `is_prime` list at index `j`. The values of `n`, `is_prime`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is now `i * i + 2 * i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.**
