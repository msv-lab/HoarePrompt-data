The code initializes a list `is_prime` with `n` elements, all set to `True`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function would return 0, but since the code provided does not include a return statement, we only consider the initialization of `is_prime`. 

If `n` is 0 or 1, `is_prime` will be an empty list. If `n` is 2, `is_prime` will contain one element set to `True`. If `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` will contain `n` elements, all set to `True`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `is_prime` based on the value of `n`:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is an array of size `n` initialized to `True`**
