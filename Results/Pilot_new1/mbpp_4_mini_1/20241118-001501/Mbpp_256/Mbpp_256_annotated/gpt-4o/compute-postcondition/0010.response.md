The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is defined as `i * i + i`. The previous state indicates that `is_prime[j]` was `True` prior to this assignment. Therefore, after executing this line, `is_prime[j]` is now `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is now `i * i + i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.**
