The code assigns `False` to the first two elements of the `is_prime` array. Since `is_prime` is an array of size `n` initialized to `True`, it means that the values of `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` change from `True` to `False`. The other elements of the array, if any, remain `True`. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[i]` is True for all i from 2 to n-1 if n > 1**
