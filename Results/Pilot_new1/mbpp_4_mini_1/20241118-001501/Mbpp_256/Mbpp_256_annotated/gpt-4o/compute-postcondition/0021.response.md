According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 6, `n` is greater than 6, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to calculate the new value of `j`, which is determined by the expression `j = j + i`. Since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be 8 (i.e., `j = 6 + 2`). 

Now we need to ensure that this new value of `j` is still less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 6, we can state that `n` must also be greater than 8 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states as follows:
- `j` should be updated to 8.
- `n` should be updated to be greater than 8.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 8, `i` is 2, `j` is 8, and `is_prime[6]` is set to `False`**
