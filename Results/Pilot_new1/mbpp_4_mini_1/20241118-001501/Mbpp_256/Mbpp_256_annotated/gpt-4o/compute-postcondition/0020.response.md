The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`. Since `j` is 6, this means `is_prime[6]` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[6]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[6]` is set to `False**
