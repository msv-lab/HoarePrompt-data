The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The variable `j` is defined as `i * i`, and since `i` is less than the square root of `n`, `j` will be a number that is at least 4 (if `i` is 2) and less than `n`. The previous state indicates that `is_prime[i]` is `True` for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, which means that `is_prime[j]` was `True` before this assignment. After executing the code, `is_prime[j]` is now `False`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is `i * i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is `i * i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.**
