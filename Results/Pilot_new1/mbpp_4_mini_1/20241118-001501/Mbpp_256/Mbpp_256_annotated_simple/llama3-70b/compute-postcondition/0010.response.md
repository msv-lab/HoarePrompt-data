According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 2 and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. 

Since `num` is 9 or greater, we also need to ensure that `num` is still greater than or equal to `i` squared (to ensure that the loop condition still holds). Specifically, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. 

At `i = 3`, we calculate `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. If `num` is 9, `int(num ** 0.5)` is 3, so `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is 4, allowing for one more iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be at least 9 (which it is), and `i` should be updated to 4.

State: **`num` is 9 or greater, `i` is 4**
