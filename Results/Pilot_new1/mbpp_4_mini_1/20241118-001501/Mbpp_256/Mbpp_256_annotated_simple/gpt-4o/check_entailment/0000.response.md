To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a non-negative number `n` and return the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n <= 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return a value (implicitly returns None).
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If n is 0 or 1, then is_prime is empty. If n is 2 or more, is_prime has the first two elements set to False. If n is at least 2, the loop will execute starting with i = 2. If is_prime[i] is True and n is at least i * i, then all multiples of i from i * i to n will be set to False in is_prime. If is_prime[i] is False or if n is less than i * i, is_prime remains unchanged. The loop will execute for values of i up to âˆšn (inclusive), and if n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, leaving is_prime unchanged.
    return sum(is_prime)
    #The program returns the sum of the boolean values in the list 'is_prime', which indicates the count of prime numbers up to n.
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - The code correctly returns `0` for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, since there are no prime numbers less than these values.
   - For `n = 2`, it also returns `0`, which is correct.

2. **Prime Number Calculation**:
   - The list `is_prime` is initialized correctly with `True` values, and the first two indices are set to `False` (since 0 and 1 are not prime).
   - The algorithm uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark non-prime numbers, which is an efficient way to find all primes less than `n`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the sum of `is_prime`, which gives the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Potential Issues:
The code seems to handle all edge cases correctly based on the problem description. However, we must ensure it works for all non-negative integers, particularly larger values of `n`. 

- For `n = 3`, the primes less than `3` are `2`, and the function should return `1`. The function does this correctly.
- For `n = 4`, the primes less than `4` are `2` and `3`, and the function should return `2`. The function does this correctly.
- This pattern continues for larger values of `n` as well.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering various inputs, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative integer `n`.
