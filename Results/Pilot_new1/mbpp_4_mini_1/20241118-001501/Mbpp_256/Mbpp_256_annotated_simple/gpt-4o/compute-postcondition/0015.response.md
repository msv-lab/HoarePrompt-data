Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `is_prime` has the first two elements set to `False`. If `is_prime[i]` is True, all multiples of `i` from `i * i` to `n` are set to False in `is_prime`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, the loop will execute starting from `j = i * i` (which is 4) and continue marking all valid multiples of `i` as False until reaching `n`.***
