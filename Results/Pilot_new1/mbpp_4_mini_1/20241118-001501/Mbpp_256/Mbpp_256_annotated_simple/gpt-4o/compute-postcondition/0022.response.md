The code assigns the value `False` to `is_prime[j]`. Since `j` is 15, this means `is_prime[15]` will be set to `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are `is_prime[9]` is `False` and `is_prime[12]` is `False`. The state of `n`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, and `is_prime[15]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is False**
