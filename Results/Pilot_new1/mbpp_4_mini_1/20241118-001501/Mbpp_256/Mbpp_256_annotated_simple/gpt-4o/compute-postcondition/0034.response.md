To analyze the loop's output state after execution, we consider the initial state and the behavior of the loop. The loop iterates over a range defined by `i * i` to `n`, stepping by `i`. Given the initial state, we can derive the following:

1. The loop starts at `j = i * i`, which is `16` when `i = 4`.
2. It continues to iterate as long as `j < n`, marking certain indices in the `is_prime` array as `False`.

From the provided examples, we can summarize the output state after several iterations:

- After the first iteration, `j` is `16`, and `is_prime[16]` is set to `False`. 
- After the second iteration, `j` is `20`, and `is_prime[20]` is set to `False`. 
- After the third iteration, `j` is `24`, and `is_prime[24]` is set to `False`.

Now, we consider cases where the loop might not execute:

- If `n` is exactly `16`, the loop will not execute since `j` starts at `16` and the condition `j < n` is not satisfied.
- If `n` is less than `16`, the loop will also not execute.

Thus, we can summarize the output state as follows:

Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` will have `is_prime[16]`, `is_prime[20]`, and `is_prime[24]` set to `False`. If n is less than or equal to 16, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
