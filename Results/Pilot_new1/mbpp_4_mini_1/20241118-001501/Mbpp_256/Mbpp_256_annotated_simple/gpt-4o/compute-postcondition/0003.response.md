The code initializes a list `is_prime` with `n` elements, all set to `True`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function would return 0, but since the code provided does not include any conditional return statements, it will proceed to create the list regardless of the value of `n`. 

The output state will reflect the current state of `n` and the newly created list `is_prime`. If `n` is 0 or 1, `is_prime` will be an empty list. If `n` is 2, `is_prime` will have one element set to `True`. If `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` will have `n` elements all set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `True` (or empty if `n` is 0 or 1)**
