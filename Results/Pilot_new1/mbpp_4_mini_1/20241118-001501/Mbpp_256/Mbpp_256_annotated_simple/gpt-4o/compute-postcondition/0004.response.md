The code sets the first two elements of the `is_prime` list to `False`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the list remains empty. If `n` is 2 or greater, the first two elements (indices 0 and 1) of the list change from `True` to `False`. Therefore, the output state depends on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is either empty (if `n` is 0 or 1) or has the first two elements set to `False` (if `n` is 2 or more)**
