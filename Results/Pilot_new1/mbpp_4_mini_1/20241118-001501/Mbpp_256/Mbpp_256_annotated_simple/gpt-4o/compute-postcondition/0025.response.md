Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 9 and `i` is 3. If `is_prime[i]` is True and `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`, then `is_prime[j]` is set to False for all `j` in the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. If `is_prime[i]` is False or if `n` is less than `i * i`, then `is_prime` remains unchanged, retaining its initial values of the first two elements set to False.***
