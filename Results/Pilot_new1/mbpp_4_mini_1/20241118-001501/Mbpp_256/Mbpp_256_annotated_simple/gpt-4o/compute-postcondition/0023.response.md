According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `j` is 15
- `n` is greater than 12

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 12, we need to ensure that `j` is adjusted to be 15 + `i` (which is 3) for the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will be 18.

Now, we need to check if `j` (which will be 18) is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 12, `j` being 18 means that `n` must also be greater than 18 for the loop to execute one more time.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` is now 18
- `n` must be greater than 18

State: **`n` is greater than 18, `i` is 3, `j` is 18, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is False**
