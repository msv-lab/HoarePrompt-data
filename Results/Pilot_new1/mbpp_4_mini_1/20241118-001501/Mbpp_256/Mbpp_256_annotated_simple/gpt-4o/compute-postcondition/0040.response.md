Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it counts and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function will return 0, and for `n` equal to 2, it also returns 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 2.**
