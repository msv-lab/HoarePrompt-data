According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 12, `n` is greater than 12, and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be adjusted to the next value that will be computed in the loop, which is `j + i`. Thus, the new value of `j` will be 15 (since 12 + 3 = 15).

Since `n` is greater than 12, it can accommodate the new value of `j`. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted, and the loop can execute again with the updated value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False**
