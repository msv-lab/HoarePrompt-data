The loop marks multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n` in the `is_prime` list as `False`. Given the initial state, if `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop will not execute at all.

Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to i * i, then `is_prime[j]` is False for all j in the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. If n is less than i * i, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged, retaining its initial values.**
