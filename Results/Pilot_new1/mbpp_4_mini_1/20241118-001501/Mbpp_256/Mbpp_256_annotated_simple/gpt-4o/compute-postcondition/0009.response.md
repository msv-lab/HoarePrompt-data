According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 4. 

To determine the next state:
- The current value of `j` is 4.
- The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) in each iteration. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `4 + 2 = 6`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 4, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 6 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` will now be 6, and `n` must be greater than 6.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[4]` is now `False`**
