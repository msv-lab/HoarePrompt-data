To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(n)` and see if it correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Prime Number Calculation**:
   - The function initializes a list `is_prime` of size `n`, where each index represents whether that number is prime.
   - It sets the indices 0 and 1 to `False` because 0 and 1 are not prime numbers.
   - It then iterates from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each prime number found, it marks its multiples as non-prime.

3. **Counting Primes**: Finally, it returns the sum of the `is_prime` list, which effectively counts the number of `True` values, indicating the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Case 1**: `func_1(0)` should return 0 because there are no prime numbers less than 0.
- **Case 2**: `func_1(1)` should also return 0 for the same reason.
- **Case 3**: `func_1(2)` should return 0 since there are no primes less than 2.
- **Case 4**: `func_1(3)` should return 1, as the only prime number less than 3 is 2.
- **Case 5**: `func_1(4)` should return 2, as the prime numbers less than 4 are 2 and 3.

### Conclusion:

The program seems to handle all edge cases correctly, returning the expected number of primes less than the given `n`. 

Thus, after considering the problem description and testing various edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than any non-negative integer input.
