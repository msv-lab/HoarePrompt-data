According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to `i * i`, and since `is_prime[j]` was set to `False`, we know that `j` is not a prime number.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine what `j` will be at the start of the next iteration. The loop increments `j` by `i` in each iteration, so the next value of `j` will be `j + i`.

Given that `j` is currently `i * i`, the next value will be:
- `j + i = i * i + i`

We need to ensure that this new value of `j` is still less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust our state to reflect that `j` will take on this new value.

Since `n` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 4, we don't need to adjust `n`. However, we need to ensure that `j` is updated to reflect the next value.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect:
- `j` is now `i * i + i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
