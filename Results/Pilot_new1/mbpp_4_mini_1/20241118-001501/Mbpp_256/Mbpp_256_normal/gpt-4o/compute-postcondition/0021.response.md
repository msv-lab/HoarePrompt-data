According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have `j` equal to `i * i + i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is updated to the next value in the range, which would be `j = j + i`.

Since `j` is currently `i * i + i`, the next value of `j` will be `i * i + 2 * i`. We need to check if this new value of `j` is still less than `n`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and that `i * i < n`, it is likely that `i` is small enough such that `i * i + 2 * i` is still less than `n`, but we need to explicitly state this condition.

Thus, the updated state should reflect that `j` is set to `i * i + 2 * i` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i + 2 * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
