The value of `j` is assigned as `i * i`, and since `i * i < n`, `j` is a valid index for the list `is_prime`. The code sets the value at index `j` of the list `is_prime` to `False`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
