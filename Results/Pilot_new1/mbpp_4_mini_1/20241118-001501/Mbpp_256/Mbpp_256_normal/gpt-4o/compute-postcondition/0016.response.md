According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `2` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to `4`. If `n` is exactly `4`, the loop would execute 0 times, and thus `i` would not change. If `n` is greater than `4`, the loop would have executed for values of `i` starting from `2` up to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the maximum value of `i` that the loop can take. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. If `n` is greater than `4`, then `int(n ** 0.5)` is greater than `2`, meaning that the loop can run for at least one iteration. 

If `n` is greater than `4`, the last value of `i` would have been `int(n ** 0.5)`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` needs to be adjusted to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

If `n` is exactly `4`, `i` would remain `2`, and the loop wouldn't execute, so `i` would still be `2`.

Therefore, the final state should reflect that `i` is now `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` if `n` is greater than `4` or remains `2` if `n` is exactly `4`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`**
