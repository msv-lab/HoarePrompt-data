The code sets the value of `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The initial state indicates that `j` is calculated as `i * i + i`, and `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, the assignment modifies the element at index `j` in the `is_prime` list to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
