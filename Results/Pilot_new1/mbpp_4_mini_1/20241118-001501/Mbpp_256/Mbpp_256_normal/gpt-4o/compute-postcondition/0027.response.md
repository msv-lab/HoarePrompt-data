According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop starts at `j = i * i` and continues while `j < n`, incrementing `j` by `i` in each iteration. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 9 and `i` is 3, the initial value of `j` will be `3 * 3 = 9`. Since the loop condition is `j < n`, for the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `n`. This means that `n` must be greater than 9 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 9, and we also need to state the initial value of `j`. 

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
