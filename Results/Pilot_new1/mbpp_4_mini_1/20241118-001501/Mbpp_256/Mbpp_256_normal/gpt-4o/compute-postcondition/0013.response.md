According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 8 and `n` is greater than 8. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value calculated by the expression `j + i`, which is `8 + 2 = 10`. 

Since `n` is greater than 8, it does not need to be adjusted, but we now need to ensure that `j` is less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state needs to be updated to reflect that `j` is now 10.

State: **`n` is greater than 8, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 10, and `is_prime[10]` is set to `False`**
