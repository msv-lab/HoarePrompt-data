The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return any value (undefined behavior). Additionally, the function returns the sum of the values in the list `is_prime`, which counts the number of prime numbers up to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` greater than 1 and, based on the value of `n`, either return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, or return the sum of the prime counts up to `n` if `n` is greater than 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2; if `n` is greater than 2, it returns the sum of the prime counts up to `n`.**
