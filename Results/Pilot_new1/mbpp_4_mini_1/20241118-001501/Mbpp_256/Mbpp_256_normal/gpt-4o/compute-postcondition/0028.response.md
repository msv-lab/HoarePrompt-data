The code assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. Given that `j` is 9, the 9th index of the list `is_prime` will be set to `False`. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and the rest of the list `is_prime`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
