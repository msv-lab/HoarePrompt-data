Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and all other elements are `True`. If `is_prime[2]` is `True`, then all multiples of `2` starting from `4` (i.e., `i * i`) up to `n` are marked as `False` in `is_prime`. If `n` is less than `4`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices. If `n` is exactly `4`, the loop executes 0 times, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for those indices. All other indices in `is_prime` that are multiples of `2` are set to `False` if `n` is greater than `4`.***
