Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then for every index `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` (exclusive) and incremented by `i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged.***
