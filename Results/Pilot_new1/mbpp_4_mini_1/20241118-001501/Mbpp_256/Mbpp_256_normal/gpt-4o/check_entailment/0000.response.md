To analyze the program and determine its correctness, let's first review the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(5) == 2
assert func_1(10) == 4
assert func_1(100) == 25
def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
assert func_1(5) == 2
assert func_1(10) == 4
assert func_1(100) == 25
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to count and return the number of prime numbers less than `n`. However, if `n` is less than 2, the function does not handle this case properly, as it is expected to return 0 but it may lead to undefined behavior due to the lack of a return statement for values greater than 2.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function correctly checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2 and returns 0 in such cases. This aligns with the problem description.
2. For `n > 2`, the function implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm correctly to determine the number of primes less than `n`.
3. The assertions provided are consistent with the expected outputs for the given inputs.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case when `n` is 0 and 1 correctly by returning 0.
- The program also handles the case when `n` is 2 correctly by returning 0.
- The algorithm appears to be implemented correctly for all values of `n > 2`.

### Verification Against Output Hints:
The output hints suggest that the function does not handle cases properly for values less than 2, but this is misleading. The function does return 0 for `n <= 2`, which is correct behavior as per the problem description. The hints also mention potential undefined behavior, but this does not apply here since the function has a clear return statement for all cases.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of the code and the problem description, the function correctly implements the required logic for counting prime numbers less than `n` and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.
