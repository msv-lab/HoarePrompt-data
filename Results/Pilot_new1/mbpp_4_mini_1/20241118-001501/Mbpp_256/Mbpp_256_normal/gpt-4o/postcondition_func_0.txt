The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to count and return the number of prime numbers less than `n`. However, if `n` is less than 2, the function does not handle this case properly, as it is expected to return 0 but it may lead to undefined behavior due to the lack of a return statement for values greater than 2.
