According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. The loop starts at 2 and goes up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2, as the function returns False if `num` is less than 2. 

If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop will execute, starting with `i` at 2. The upper limit for the loop is determined by `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, which must also be at least 2 for the loop to run.

So for the loop to be executed, `num` must be 2 or greater, and `i` will start at 2.

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
