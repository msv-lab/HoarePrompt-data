The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. According to the output cases:

- Case 1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`.
- Case 2: If `num` is 2 or greater, the function does not return any value, implying that it does not return `False`, which indicates that `num` could potentially be prime.
- Case 3: If `num` is greater than 2 and is not divisible by any integer `i` up to the square root of `num`, the function does not return any value, implying that `num` is prime.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, and does not return a value (implying `num` is prime) if `num` is 2 or greater and not divisible by any integer up to its square root.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, and does not return a value (implying `num` is prime) if `num` is 2 or greater and not divisible by any integer up to its square root.**
