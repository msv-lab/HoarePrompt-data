The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2. If `num` is 2 or greater, it checks if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, it returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is prime. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
