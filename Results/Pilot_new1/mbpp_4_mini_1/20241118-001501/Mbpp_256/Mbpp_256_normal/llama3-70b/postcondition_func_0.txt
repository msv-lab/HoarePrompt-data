The function accepts an integer `n` and counts the number of prime numbers in the range from 2 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0, as there are no prime numbers in that range. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers found. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 2, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
