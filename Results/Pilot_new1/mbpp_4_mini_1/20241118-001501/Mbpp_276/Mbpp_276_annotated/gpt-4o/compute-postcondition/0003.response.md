Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which should be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula \( \text{volume} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). However, there are no checks for negative values or zero values for `radius` and `height`, which could lead to incorrect interpretations of volume in real-world scenarios.**
