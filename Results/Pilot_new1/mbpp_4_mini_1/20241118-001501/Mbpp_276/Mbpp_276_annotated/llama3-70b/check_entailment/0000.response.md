Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to return the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height, which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. However, the code does not handle cases where either `radius` or `height` is negative.

The annotations indicate that the function calculates the volume using the formula π * radius² * height, but they also explicitly mention that it does not handle negative inputs, which would be invalid for calculating a physical volume. This means that if a user inputs negative values for `radius` or `height`, the function would still attempt to compute a volume, resulting in a negative or nonsensical output.

For example, if we call `func_1(-1, 5)`, the function would return a negative volume, which is not valid. Similarly, calling `func_1(1, -5)` would also yield an invalid result. The failure to account for these cases means that the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, since the program does not cover all potential cases correctly, the final verdict is that the code is incorrect.
