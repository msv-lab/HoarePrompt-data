Correctness: **False**.

The program does not import the `math` module, which is necessary for using `math.pi`. If the function is called without importing `math`, it will raise a `NameError`. For example, calling `func_1(3, 5)` will result in an error because `math` is not defined. Thus, the function does not work correctly for all potential cases.
