Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula π * radius² * height. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, nor does it check for the validity of the parameters, which could lead to incorrect results if negative values are provided. **
