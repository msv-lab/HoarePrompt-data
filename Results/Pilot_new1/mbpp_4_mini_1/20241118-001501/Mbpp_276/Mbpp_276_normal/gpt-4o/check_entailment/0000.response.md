The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height using the formula \( \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). 

Initially, the code appears to fulfill the problem description correctly. The formula used is indeed the correct one for calculating the volume of a cylinder.

However, upon examining the output hints, we see that the function does not handle cases where the `radius` or `height` is negative. The problem description implies that both parameters should be non-negative real numbers. If either `radius` or `height` is negative, the volume would be mathematically incorrect or undefined, which is a significant edge case that the code fails to address. 

The output hints clearly state that the function "does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative," which indicates that the function could produce incorrect results or behave unexpectedly when negative values are passed as arguments.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when negative values are provided for the radius or height.

Correctness: **False**.
