The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 5; if so, it returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function initializes a variable `factorial` to 1, but it does not compute the factorial of `n` as the annotations suggest. Therefore, it fails to calculate the last digit of the factorial and does not return it. The function lacks the logic to calculate `factorial` for values of `n` less than 5. Thus, the functionality of the function is to return 0 for `n` values of 5 or greater, while for `n` values less than 5, it does not return the last digit of the factorial as intended.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. For `n` less than 5, it does not compute or return the last digit of the factorial of `n`. **
