To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the last digit of the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n >= 5) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    else :
        factorial = 1
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` (which is 1 for `n` = 0, 1 for `n` = 1, 2 for `n` = 2, 6 for `n` = 3, and 24 for `n` = 4) and returns the last digit of that factorial (0 for `n` = 0 and 1, 2 for `n` = 2, 6 for `n` = 3, and 4 for `n` = 4).
```

### Code Analysis:
1. **When `n >= 5`:** The function returns `0`. This is correct because the last digit of the factorial of any number `5` or greater will always involve a multiplication of `10` (from `2` and `5`), thus yielding a last digit of `0`.
  
2. **When `n < 5`:** The code initializes `factorial = 1`, but it does not compute the factorial or return the last digit for values of `n` less than `5`. The logic to calculate the factorial and return the last digit is missing. 

   - For `n = 0`: The factorial is `1`, last digit is `1`.
   - For `n = 1`: The factorial is `1`, last digit is `1`.
   - For `n = 2`: The factorial is `2`, last digit is `2`.
   - For `n = 3`: The factorial is `6`, last digit is `6`.
   - For `n = 4`: The factorial is `24`, last digit is `4`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to compute and return the last digit of the factorial for any `n` less than `5`. For example, if we call `func_1(3)`, it will not return the correct last digit of `6`, instead, it will just proceed to the end of the function without returning anything, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
