Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial. Specifically, it returns 1 for `n` = 0 and 1, 2 for `n` = 2, 6 for `n` = 3, and 4 for `n` = 4. However, the code does not implement the calculation for the last digit of the factorial for values of `n` less than 5, which is missing functionality.**
