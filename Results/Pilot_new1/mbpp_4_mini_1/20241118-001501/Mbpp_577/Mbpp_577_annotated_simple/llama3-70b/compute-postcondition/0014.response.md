Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `n` if `n` is less than 2. It returns `n` if `n` is equal to 2 or 3. If `n` is equal to 4, it returns 4. For all other values of `n` that are greater than 4 or any non-negative integers less than 4 that are not equal to 2 or 3, the function returns 0. The function does not handle negative integers, as it assumes the input is always a non-negative integer. **
