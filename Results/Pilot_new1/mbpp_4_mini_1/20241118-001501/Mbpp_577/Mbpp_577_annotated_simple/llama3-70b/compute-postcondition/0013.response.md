The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than 2, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 2 or 3, the function returns `n`. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4. For all other non-negative integers greater than 4 or those less than 4 that are not equal to 2 or 3, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return specific values based on the value of `n` as described in the cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns n if n is less than 2, returns n if n is equal to 2 or 3, returns 4 if n is equal to 4, and returns 0 for all other non-negative integers greater than 4 or those less than 4 that are not equal to 2 or 3.**
