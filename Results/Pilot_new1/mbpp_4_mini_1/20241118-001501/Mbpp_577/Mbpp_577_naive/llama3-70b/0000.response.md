Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires finding the last digit of the factorial of a given number. The program does not correctly compute the last digit of the factorial for all cases. For instance:

- For `n = 5`, the factorial is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program returns `0` which is correct, but it does not compute it through factorial logic.
- For `n = 6`, the factorial is `6! = 720`, and the last digit is `0`. The program returns `0` as well, but it does not actually compute the factorial.
- For `n = 7`, the factorial is `7! = 5040`, and the last digit is `0`. Again, the program returns `0`, but it does not compute the factorial.
- For `n = 1`, the program returns `1`, which is correct since `1! = 1`.

However, the program does not implement a general solution for calculating the last digit of the factorial for all numbers. It only provides hardcoded returns for specific values of `n` and defaults to returning `0` for any `n >= 5`, which is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the last digit of the factorial for those values.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for a wide range of inputs.
