The variable `factorial` is initialized to 1. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, as the code only assigns a value to `factorial`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is less than 5; `factorial` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is less than 5; `factorial` is 1**
