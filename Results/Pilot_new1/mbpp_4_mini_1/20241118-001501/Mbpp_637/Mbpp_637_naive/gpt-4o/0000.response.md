Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether the given cost price and selling price are equal, which indicates no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` returns `True` when both prices are equal and `False` otherwise. The assertions provided also cover different scenarios: 

1. When the selling price is less than the cost price (1500 vs 1200), it correctly returns `False`.
2. When both prices are equal (100 vs 100), it correctly returns `True`.
3. When the selling price is greater than the cost price (2000 vs 5000), it correctly returns `False`.

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the function meets the problem description requirements.
