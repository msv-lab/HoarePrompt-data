The provided function `func_1` checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`, returning `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should determine if there is "no profit and no loss", which occurs when the cost price and selling price are the same.

However, upon further examination, there are potential edge cases that the function does not handle. For instance, if non-numeric inputs (like strings or None) are passed to the function, the comparison may raise a TypeError. The output hints mention that the function does not account for non-numeric inputs or types that cannot be compared, which is a significant oversight. This means that the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it fails to handle these edge cases.

The output hints confirm that the function will return `False` if comparisons between incompatible types are attempted, but it does not provide a graceful handling of such scenarios. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every case.

Correctness: **False**.
