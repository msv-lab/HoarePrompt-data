Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal (indicating no profit or loss) and `False` otherwise.

The annotations clarify that the function simply checks for equality between `cost_price` and `selling_price`, which directly aligns with the problem description. Since the only condition for no profit and no loss is that the selling price must equal the cost price, the implementation is sufficient to handle all potential cases.

There are no edge cases or additional logic needed beyond this comparison, and the annotations do not indicate any limitations or missing logic in the function. Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, confirming that it meets the requirements of the problem description.
