Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description correctly. The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, meaning it should return a string that does not contain any lowercase letters. However, the provided code only returns a string containing uppercase characters, effectively ignoring lowercase characters but not removing them.

For example, given the input string "HelloWorld", the expected output according to the problem description would be "HW", as the lowercase substrings "ello" and "orld" should be removed. However, the program would return "HW", which seems correct at first glance, but it does not align with the requirement to remove any lowercase substrings entirely, as it still considers the uppercase characters.

Additionally, the code annotations mention that the function returns a string containing only uppercase characters from the string 's', which supports the interpretation that the code does not fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case where lowercase letters exist.
