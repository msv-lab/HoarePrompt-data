Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the implementation only retains uppercase characters. 

For example, consider the input string "HelloWorld". The expected behavior according to the problem description would be to remove any lowercase substrings, resulting in "HW". However, the program would return "HW", which seems correct for this input but fails to address cases where lowercase substrings exist. 

Another example is the input "abcDefGhi". The expected output should be "DG" after removing all lowercase substrings, but the program would return "DG", which may seem correct but does not align with the task of removing lowercase substrings as specified.

The program is fundamentally incorrect because it does not handle the requirement of removing entire lowercase substrings, only filtering out individual lowercase characters. Thus, it does not fulfill the function described in the problem statement.
