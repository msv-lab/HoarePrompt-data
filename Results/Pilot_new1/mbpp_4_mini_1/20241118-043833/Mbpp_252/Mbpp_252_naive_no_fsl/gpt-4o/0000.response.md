To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to consider the requirements for converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.

The function `func_1(num)` uses `cmath.polar()` to convert a complex number (created from the input `num`) into polar coordinates. The polar coordinates are represented as a tuple containing the magnitude (radius) and the phase angle (in radians).

Let's analyze the provided assertions:

1. `assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)`
2. `assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)`
3. `assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)`

All these assertions are checking the conversion of real numbers to polar coordinates. However, the code does not handle complex numbers or edge cases such as:

- Negative numbers (e.g., `func_1(-1)` should yield a different phase angle).
- Complex inputs (e.g., `func_1(1 + 1j)` should return a different result).
- Zero input (e.g., `func_1(0)` should return `(0.0, 0.0)`).

The function does not account for these scenarios, which means it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases. 

For example, if we consider the case of a negative number:
```python
assert func_1(-1)  # This should yield (1.0, Ï€), but it will not be tested in the current assertions.
```

Since the function does not provide correct outputs for all potential cases, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
