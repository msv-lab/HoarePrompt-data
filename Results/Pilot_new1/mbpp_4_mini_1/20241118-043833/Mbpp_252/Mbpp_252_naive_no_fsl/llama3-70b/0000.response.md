To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and determine if it correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates.

The function is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(c):
    return (abs(c), cmath.phase(c))
```

### Analysis:

1. **Input Type**: The function takes a single argument `c`, which is expected to be a complex number. The problem description implies that we should be able to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

2. **Polar Coordinates Conversion**: The output of the function is a tuple containing:
   - `abs(c)`: This computes the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number, which is correct.
   - `cmath.phase(c)`: This computes the phase (or argument) of the complex number, which is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases**: We need to consider edge cases:
   - If `c` is `0` (the origin in the complex plane), `abs(0)` should return `0`, and `cmath.phase(0)` is defined to return `0.0`, which is correct.
   - If `c` is a purely real number (e.g., `5`), `abs(5)` returns `5`, and `cmath.phase(5)` returns `0.0`, which is correct.
   - If `c` is a purely imaginary number (e.g., `5j`), `abs(5j)` returns `5`, and `cmath.phase(5j)` returns `1.5707963267948966` (which is Ï€/2), which is also correct.

4. **Complex Numbers**: For any complex number `c = a + bj`, the function should return the correct polar coordinates (magnitude and angle) as it uses the standard library functions which are reliable.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the function and considering various edge cases, I can confirm that the function correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates for all potential inputs. There are no cases where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
