To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1(num)`.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(num):
    return cmath.polar(complex(num))
assert func_1(1) == (1.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(4) == (4.0, 0.0)
assert func_1(5) == (5.0, 0.0)
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(num)` takes a number `num`, converts it to a complex number using `complex(num)`, and then uses `cmath.polar()` to convert that complex number to its polar coordinates.
2. The polar coordinates of a complex number are represented as a tuple `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the magnitude and `theta` is the angle in radians.
3. The provided assertions test the function with real numbers (1, 4, and 5), which are indeed complex numbers with an imaginary part of 0. The expected output for these inputs is correct.

### Potential Issues:
- The function does not handle cases where the input is a complex number (e.g., `1 + 2j`), or when the input is a non-numeric type (e.g., a string or a list).
- The function does not have any checks for invalid inputs, which could lead to runtime errors.

### Test Cases:
- If we test `func_1(1 + 2j)`, we would expect it to return `(sqrt(5), atan(2))`, which is valid.
- If we test `func_1("string")`, it would raise a `TypeError` because `complex("string")` is invalid.

Given that the function does not handle all potential inputs correctly (it will fail with non-numeric inputs), we can conclude that it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle cases where the input is not a numeric type, leading to potential runtime errors.
