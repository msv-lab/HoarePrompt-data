Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. It does not handle any specific edge cases such as when both parameters are equal, or when they are of different types (e.g., integers and strings), but it effectively returns the maximum value as per the built-in `max` function behavior. **
