Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly identifies the maximum of two numbers `a` and `b`. It uses a simple conditional expression to return `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. 

The provided assertions test the function with various inputs:
- `func_1(5, 10)` correctly returns `10`, which is the maximum.
- `func_1(-1, -2)` correctly returns `-1`, which is the maximum of two negative numbers.
- `func_1(9, 7)` correctly returns `9`, which is the maximum.

The function handles all potential cases, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and the case where both numbers are equal. Since there are no edge cases or inputs where the function fails to meet the problem description, the implementation is correct.
