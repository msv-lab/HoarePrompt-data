Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the maximum of two numbers. 

- The function `func_1(a, b)` uses a conditional expression to return `a` if `a` is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. This logic correctly identifies the maximum of the two values.
- The assertions provided test various scenarios:
  - `func_1(5, 10)` correctly returns `10`.
  - `func_1(-1, -2)` correctly returns `-1`, which is the maximum of the two negative numbers.
  - `func_1(9, 7)` correctly returns `9`.

All potential cases considered (positive numbers, negative numbers, and comparisons between them) work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description requirements.
