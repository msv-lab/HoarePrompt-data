Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. For example, if the input is `func_1([[1], [2]])`, it will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the second element of the sublists which do not exist. The problem description specifies that each sublist should have two elements, but the program does not validate this condition. Hence, it fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
