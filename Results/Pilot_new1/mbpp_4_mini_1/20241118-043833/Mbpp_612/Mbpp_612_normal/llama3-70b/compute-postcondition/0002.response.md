The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of sublists, each containing exactly two elements. The function processes this input to create and return a new list that consists of two lists: the first list contains the first elements of each sublist, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist.

However, there is an implicit assumption in the code that `list_of_lists` contains sublists with exactly two elements. If any sublist has fewer or more than two elements, the function may raise an `IndexError` when trying to access elements that do not exist. This edge case is not addressed in the annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of sublists, each expected to contain exactly two elements, and returns a list containing two lists: the first list with the first elements of each sublist and the second list with the second elements. If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, it may raise an `IndexError`. **
