The provided program aims to take a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements, and return a list containing two lists: one for the first elements and another for the second elements of each sublist. 

Initial assessment of the code:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list((element[0] for element in list_of_lists)), list((element[1] for element in list_of_lists))]
```
The code appears to correctly iterate over the provided list of lists and extract the first and second elements from each sublist. However, the code does not handle cases where a sublist does not contain exactly two elements. If a sublist has fewer than two elements, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `element[1]`.

Now, let's analyze the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function accepts a list of sublists, each expected to contain exactly two elements, and returns a list containing two lists. It also mentions that if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, it may raise an `IndexError`.

The output hints agree with the code, as they both acknowledge that the function does not handle cases where a sublist has fewer than two elements. This means that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, specifically when sublists do not contain exactly two elements.

Given that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when faced with sublists that do not contain exactly two elements, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails when given input such as `[ [1], [2, 3] ]`, which would raise an `IndexError` due to the first sublist not containing two elements.
