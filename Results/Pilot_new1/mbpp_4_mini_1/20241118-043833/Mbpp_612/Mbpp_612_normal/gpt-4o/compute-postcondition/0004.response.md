Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements. It returns a list containing two lists: one with the first elements of each sublist and another with the second elements. However, if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, an `IndexError` may occur, which is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function's behavior is not guaranteed for inputs that do not meet this requirement. **
