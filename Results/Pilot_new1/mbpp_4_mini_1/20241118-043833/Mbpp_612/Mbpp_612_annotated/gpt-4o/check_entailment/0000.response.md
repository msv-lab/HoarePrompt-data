Correctness: **False**

The provided code attempts to achieve the goal of returning a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first elements and the second list contains the second elements from each sublist. However, it does not handle cases where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. 

The annotations clearly state that if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, an `IndexError` will occur. This means that the function will fail for any input that does not strictly adhere to the expectation of two elements per sublist. 

For example, if we have the input `[[1, 2], [3]]`, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access the second element of the sublist `[3]`. This behavior directly contradicts the problem description, which implies that the function should handle any list of lists appropriately.

Since the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically the case of sublists with fewer than two elements, the overall correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
