The code creates a new list `second_elements` that contains the second element (index 1) of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The previous state of `list_of_lists` is not specified, but it is assumed to contain sublists with at least two elements. The variable `first_elements` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, `second_elements` is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists**.
