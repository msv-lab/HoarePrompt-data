The function accepts a list of sublists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements. It returns a list containing two sublists: the first sublist includes all the first elements of the input sublists, and the second sublist includes all the second elements. If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, the function may raise an `IndexError`, as it assumes each sublist has at least two elements.
