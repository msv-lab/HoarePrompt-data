Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the function is expected to handle a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. However, the implementation does not include any checks to ensure that each sublist indeed contains two elements. 

The annotations mention that the function may raise an `IndexError` if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, which implies that the function is not robust against such cases. This means that if the input list contains any sublists with fewer or more than two elements, the function will fail, which is not acceptable according to the problem description.

For example, consider the input `[[1, 2], [3]]`. The expected behavior according to the problem description would be to handle this gracefully, perhaps by returning an empty list or raising a more informative error. However, the current implementation would raise an `IndexError`, which does not fulfill the requirement of handling all potential cases correctly.

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every case, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the program is **False**.
