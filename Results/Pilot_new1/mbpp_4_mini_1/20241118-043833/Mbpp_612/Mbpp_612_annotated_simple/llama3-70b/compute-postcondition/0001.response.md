The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two lists: the first list contains all the first elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains all the second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return a list containing two lists that separate the first and second elements from each sublist.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists and returns a list containing two lists: the first list contains all the first elements from each sublist, and the second list contains all the second elements from each sublist.**
