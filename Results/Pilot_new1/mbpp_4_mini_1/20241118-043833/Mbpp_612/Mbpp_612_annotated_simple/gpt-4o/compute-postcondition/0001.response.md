The code creates a new list `second_elements` that contains the second element (index 1) from each sublist within `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` remains unchanged, and the previous values of `first_elements` are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `list_of_lists` and the newly created `second_elements`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `first_elements` is a list of the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `second_elements` is a list of the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists**.
