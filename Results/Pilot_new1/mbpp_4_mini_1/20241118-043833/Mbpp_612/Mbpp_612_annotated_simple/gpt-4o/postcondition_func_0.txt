The function accepts a list of lists, where each sublist is expected to contain exactly two elements. It extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns a new list containing two lists: one with all the first elements and another with all the second elements. If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, this could lead to an IndexError, as the code does not handle such cases.
