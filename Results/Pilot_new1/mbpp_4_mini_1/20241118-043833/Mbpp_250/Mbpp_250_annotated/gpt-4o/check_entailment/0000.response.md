Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` accurately implements the requirement specified in the problem description: it takes a tuple and an element, and counts the occurrences of that element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method of tuples.

The annotations clarify that the function returns the count of occurrences of `element` in `tup`, and they assert that there are no edge cases or missing functionality in the implementation. This aligns with the problem description, which does not mention any special cases or constraints that would need additional handling.

I considered potential edge cases, such as:
- An empty tuple
- A tuple containing different data types
- Cases where the element is not present in the tuple
- Cases where the element appears multiple times

In all these scenarios, the function behaves as expected:
- An empty tuple will return a count of `0`.
- A tuple with mixed data types will correctly count occurrences of the specified element.
- If the element is not present, the count will also be `0`.
- If the element appears multiple times, it will return the correct count.

Since I could not identify any cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct. The annotations support this conclusion by indicating that the function works as intended without any missing functionality.
