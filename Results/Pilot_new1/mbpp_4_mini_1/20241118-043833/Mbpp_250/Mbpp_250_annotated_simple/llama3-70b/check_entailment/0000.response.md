Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as inputs. The function utilizes the built-in method `count()` of the tuple, which accurately counts the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

The code handles various potential cases effectively:
1. If the element exists in the tuple, it returns the correct count.
2. If the element does not exist in the tuple, it returns 0, which is the expected behavior.
3. The function can handle tuples of different data types, including integers, strings, and mixed types.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential input cases, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
