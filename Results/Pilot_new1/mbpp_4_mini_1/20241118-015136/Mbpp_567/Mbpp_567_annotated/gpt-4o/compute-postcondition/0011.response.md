Output State: **If `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, the loop checks if each element is less than or equal to the next. If any element `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. If the list is empty or contains only one element, the loop does not execute, and the state remains unchanged. In those cases, the output is that `lst` is unchanged, and the function does not return anything.**
