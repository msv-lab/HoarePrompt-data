Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements and `i` is the current index plus 1. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False, indicating that the element at index `i` is not less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything, implying that the comparison holds true.***
