According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(lst) - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which would make `i` equal to `len(lst) - 1`. 

Since `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, for the next iteration to occur, `i` should be equal to `len(lst) - 1`, which means the loop will check the last element against a non-existent next element (since the range is `len(lst) - 1`).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be updated to `len(lst) - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `lst` remains unchanged.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is len(lst) - 1**
