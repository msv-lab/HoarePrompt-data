Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one using the condition `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]`. The use of `all()` ensures that the function returns `True` only if all comparisons hold true. 

The function handles various cases:
- An empty list returns `True` as there are no elements to compare.
- A single-element list also returns `True` since there are no pairs to compare.
- A list with duplicate elements is considered sorted, as it satisfies the non-decreasing condition.

Overall, the implementation covers all potential edge cases and adheres to the problem description.
