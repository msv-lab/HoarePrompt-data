The provided program aims to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The implementation iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element.

Let's analyze the function:

1. The loop iterates through the list from the start to the second-to-last element.
2. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such case, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

Now, let's consider some edge cases:

- An empty list should be considered sorted. The function would return `True` for an empty list, which is correct.
- A list with a single element should also be considered sorted. The function would return `True` for a single-element list, which is correct.
- The function correctly handles lists with duplicate elements since it only checks for greater-than conditions.

Now, let's test the function with various inputs:

- `func_1([])` should return `True` (empty list).
- `func_1([1])` should return `True` (single element).
- `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])` should return `True` (sorted with duplicates).
- `func_1([3, 2, 1])` should return `False` (not sorted).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 2])` should return `False` (not sorted).

Since the function correctly handles all the above cases and adheres to the problem description, we conclude that there are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
