The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. It does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or contains a single element, but in such scenarios, it will return `True` since an empty list or a single-element list is trivially sorted.
