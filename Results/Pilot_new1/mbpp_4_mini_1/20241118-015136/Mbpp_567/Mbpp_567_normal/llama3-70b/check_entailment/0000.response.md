The provided program is designed to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to compare each element of the list with the next one.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it appears that the function should return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise. The generator expression checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, which aligns with the requirement for non-decreasing order.

However, considering edge cases is crucial. The program does not explicitly handle empty lists or lists with a single element. According to the problem description and typical conventions in programming, an empty list or a single-element list is generally considered sorted. The output hints indicate that the function will return `True` for these cases, which is indeed correct.

Now, let's examine the output hints: they state that the function returns `True` for an empty list or a single-element list, which aligns with our initial assessment. The hints also confirm that the function will check the non-decreasing order for lists with multiple elements.

Since the function behaves correctly for all potential cases, including empty lists and single-element lists, we conclude that it adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
