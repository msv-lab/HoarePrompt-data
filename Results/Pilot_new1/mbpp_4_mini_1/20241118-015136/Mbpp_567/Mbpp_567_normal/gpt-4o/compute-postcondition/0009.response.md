Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. If the last element of `lst` (i.e., `lst[len(lst) - 1]`) is greater than the second last element (i.e., `lst[len(lst) - 2]`), the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything, implying no conditions are met for returning False.***
