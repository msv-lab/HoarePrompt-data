Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The logic of the function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the following element, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The test cases provided in the assertions also confirm the correctness of the function:
- The first assertion checks a sorted list and returns `True`, which is correct.
- The second assertion checks a list that is not sorted (the last two elements are out of order) and returns `False`, which is correct.
- The third assertion checks another unsorted list and also returns `False`, which is again correct.

Since there are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description, the function is indeed correct.
