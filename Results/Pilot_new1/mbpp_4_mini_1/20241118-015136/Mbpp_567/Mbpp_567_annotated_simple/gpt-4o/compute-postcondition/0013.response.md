The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` contains at least 2 comparable elements, the function checks if any element is greater than the subsequent element. If it finds such an element, the function returns `False`. If `lst` has only 1 element or is empty, no comparison is made, and the function does not return anything, leaving `lst` unchanged. In all other cases, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return `False` if there is an element greater than the next one, return `True` if all elements are in non-decreasing order, and return nothing if the list is empty or has only one element. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns False if any element in lst is greater than the next one; returns True if all elements are in non-decreasing order; returns nothing if lst is empty or has only one element.**
