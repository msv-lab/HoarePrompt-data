According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. The loop will execute if `len(lst) - 1` is at least 1, which means `len(lst)` must be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must contain at least 2 comparable elements. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting index for the range.

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
