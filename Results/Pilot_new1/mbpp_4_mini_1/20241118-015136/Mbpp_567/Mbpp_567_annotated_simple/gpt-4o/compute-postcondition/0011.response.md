Output State: **If `lst` is a list with at least 2 comparable elements, the loop checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element is greater than the subsequent element, the function returns False. If `lst` has only 1 element or is empty, the loop does not execute, and no comparison is made; thus, no return occurs. In such cases, the output state is that `lst` remains unchanged, and the function does not return anything.**
