Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `all()` function to iterate through the list and compare each element with the next one. If all comparisons satisfy the condition `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]`, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. If any comparison fails, it returns `False`.

The code handles various cases correctly:
1. An empty list should return `True` since there are no elements to violate the sorted order.
2. A list with one element should also return `True` for the same reason.
3. A list with multiple elements will be evaluated correctly for non-decreasing order.

No edge cases or potential inputs were found that would cause the function to behave incorrectly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
