The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings (representing student names) and values are tuples of two floats (representing student height and weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats that represent the minimum height and weight, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students who meet the specified height and weight criteria.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of students with their height and weight, and two float values representing minimum height and weight. It returns a dictionary containing students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
