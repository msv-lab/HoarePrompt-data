Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly filters students based on their height and weight according to the specified minimum values. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the items in the input dictionary, checking if each student's height and weight meet or exceed the provided minimum thresholds. 

The annotations in the code accurately describe the functionality of the program, confirming that it returns a dictionary of students who satisfy the height and weight conditions. 

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential inputs.
