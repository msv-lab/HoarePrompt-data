Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to filter students based on their height and weight against the specified minimum values. 

1. It takes a dictionary `student_data` where each key is a student's name and the value is a tuple containing the student's height and weight.
2. It uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over each student in `student_data`.
3. For each student, it checks if both the height and weight are greater than or equal to the provided minimum values (`min_height` and `min_weight`).
4. If both conditions are satisfied, the student is included in the resulting dictionary.

The program handles the following potential cases correctly:
- If the dictionary is empty, it will return an empty dictionary, which is expected behavior.
- If all students meet the height and weight requirements, it will return all students.
- If no students meet the criteria, it will return an empty dictionary, which also aligns with the problem description.

Since I could not find any potential cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
