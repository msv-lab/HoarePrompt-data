Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` containing student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, along with two float parameters `min_height` and `min_weight`. It returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet these criteria, an empty dictionary is returned. **
