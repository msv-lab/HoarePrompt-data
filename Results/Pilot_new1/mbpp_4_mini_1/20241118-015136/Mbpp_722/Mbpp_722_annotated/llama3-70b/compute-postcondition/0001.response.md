The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 

- `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a student name, and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight (student_height, student_weight).
- `min_height` is a float representing the minimum height.
- `min_weight` is a float representing the minimum weight.

After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student data along with minimum height and weight values, and return a filtered dictionary of students who meet the specified height and weight criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_data`, a float `min_height`, and a float `min_weight`, and returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.**
