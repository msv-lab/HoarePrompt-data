Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly filters students based on the given minimum height and weight. It utilizes a dictionary comprehension to iterate through the input dictionary and checks if each student's height and weight meet or exceed the specified minimums. 

The provided assertions test various scenarios:

1. In the first assertion, only 'Cierra Vega' meets the criteria of height >= 6.0 and weight >= 70.
2. In the second assertion, both 'Cierra Vega' and 'Kierra Gentry' meet the criteria of height >= 5.9 and weight >= 67.
3. In the third assertion, all students meet the criteria of height >= 5.7 and weight >= 64.

Since the function passes all test cases and correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, it is deemed correct.
