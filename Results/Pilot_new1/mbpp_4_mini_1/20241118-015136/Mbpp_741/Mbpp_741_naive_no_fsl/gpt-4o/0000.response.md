Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same. However, the assertions provided in the program are incorrect based on the problem description.

1. `assert func_1('python') == False`: This assertion is correct because the characters are not the same.
2. `assert func_1('aaa') == True`: This assertion is also correct because all characters are the same.
3. `assert func_1('data') == False`: This assertion is correct as well, since the characters are not all the same.

However, the program fails to handle the case of an empty string correctly according to the problem description. The problem states that the function should check if all characters are the same, and while the function returns `True` for an empty string, it does not clarify whether this is the expected behavior. 

A more appropriate response for an empty string would be to return `False` since there are no characters to compare. Thus, the function's handling of the empty string is ambiguous and does not meet the requirement of the problem description.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly handle the case of an empty string, it is considered incorrect.
