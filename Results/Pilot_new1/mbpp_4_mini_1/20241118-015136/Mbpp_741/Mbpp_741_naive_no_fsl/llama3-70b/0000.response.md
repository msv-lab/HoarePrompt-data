Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s: str) -> bool:` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters, and then checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. 

This implementation correctly handles several cases:
1. If the input string is empty (`s = ""`), the set will also be empty, and `len(set(""))` will equal 0. Thus, the function will return `False`, which is correct since there are no characters to compare.
2. If the input string contains only one character (e.g., `s = "a"`), the set will contain that single character, and `len(set("a"))` will equal 1, thus returning `True`, which is correct.
3. For strings with multiple identical characters (e.g., `s = "aaaa"`), the set will contain one element, and the function will return `True`.
4. For strings with different characters (e.g., `s = "abc"`), the set will contain multiple elements, and the function will return `False`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and there are no edge cases where it fails to meet the problem description, the correctness of the program is confirmed as True.
