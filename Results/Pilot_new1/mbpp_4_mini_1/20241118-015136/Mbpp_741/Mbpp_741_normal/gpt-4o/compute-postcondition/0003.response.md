The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. If `s` is empty, attempting to access `s[0]` would raise an IndexError, but since the initial state specifies that if `s` is empty the function returns True, we can conclude that `s` is not empty when this line of code is executed. Therefore, `first_char` will hold the first character of the non-empty string `s`. 

The output state does not change any other variables, so we state the values accordingly.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
