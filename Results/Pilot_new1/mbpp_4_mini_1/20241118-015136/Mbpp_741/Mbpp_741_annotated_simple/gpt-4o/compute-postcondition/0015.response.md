Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will check each character against `first_char`. If all characters are equal to `first_char`, the function completes without returning. If any character differs from `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. If `s` is empty, an IndexError occurs, and the loop does not execute. In summary, if `s` is non-empty, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the loop verifies that all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and an IndexError occurs.**
