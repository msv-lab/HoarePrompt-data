Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If the third character `char` is not equal to the first character `first_char`, the function returns False. If `char` is equal to `first_char`, no action is taken, and the function does not return anything.***
