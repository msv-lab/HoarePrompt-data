According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop cannot execute and an IndexError will occur. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must contain at least one character. Additionally, `first_char` should be set to the first character of `s`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
