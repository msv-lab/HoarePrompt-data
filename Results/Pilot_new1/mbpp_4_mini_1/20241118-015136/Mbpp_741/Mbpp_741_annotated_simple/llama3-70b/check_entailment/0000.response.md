To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1(s)` and the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a Python function to check whether all the characters in a given string `s` are the same or not.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    # The program returns True if all characters in the string 's' are the same, otherwise it returns False
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function converts the string `s` into a set using `set(s)`. A set in Python is a collection of unique elements.
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one unique character.
   - The function checks if the length of this set is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that all characters are the same. If not, it returns `False`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string `""` should also be considered. In this case, `set("")` results in an empty set, and `len(set(""))` equals 0, which means the function would return `False`. This could be interpreted as not all characters being the same, but it may also be argued that there are no characters to compare.
   - A string with a single character, like `"a"`, should return `True` because there is only one character.
   - Strings with different characters, like `"abc"`, should return `False`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly identifies when all characters are the same for non-empty strings.
   - However, the handling of the empty string case could be considered problematic. Depending on interpretation, some might argue that an empty string should return `True` (since there are no differing characters), while others might argue it should return `False`.

### Conclusion:
Due to the ambiguity in handling the empty string case, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program fails to correctly handle the edge case of an empty string, which could lead to different interpretations of whether all characters are the same. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem description in all scenarios.
