According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will continue to iterate over the characters in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in the string `s`. Since `char` is currently equal to `first_char`, it implies that the loop has already processed the first character. Therefore, to execute one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`, and the index of the character processed must be incremented.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
