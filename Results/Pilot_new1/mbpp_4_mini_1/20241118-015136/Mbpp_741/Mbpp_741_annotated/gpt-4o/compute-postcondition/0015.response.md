Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop checks each character against `first_char`. If all characters are equal to `first_char`, the function implicitly returns None after the loop. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. If `s` is empty, the function returns True before entering the loop. Therefore, if `s` is empty, the output is True; if `s` is non-empty, the output is either False (if any character differs from `first_char`) or None (if all characters are the same as `first_char`.**
