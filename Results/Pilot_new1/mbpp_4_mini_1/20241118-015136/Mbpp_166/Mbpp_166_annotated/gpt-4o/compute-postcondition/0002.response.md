The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `even_count` is known, and we can calculate `even_pairs` based on it. The variable `odd_count` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `even_count`, `odd_count`, and the newly calculated `even_pairs`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`, `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2**
