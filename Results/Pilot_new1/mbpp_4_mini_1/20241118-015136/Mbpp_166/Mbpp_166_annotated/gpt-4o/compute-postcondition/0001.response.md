The code assigns the value of `len(lst) - even_count` to `odd_count`. The length of `lst` represents the total number of integers in the list, and by subtracting `even_count`, we determine the count of odd integers. The value of `even_count` is not specified, but it is known that `lst` contains integers. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, and `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, and `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`**
