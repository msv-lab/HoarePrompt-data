The value of `odd_pairs` is assigned the result of the expression `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The variable `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`. Therefore, `odd_pairs` is calculated based on the value of `odd_count`. The previous values of the affected variables are `lst` as a list of integers, `even_count` as the count of even integers in `lst`, and `odd_count` as `len(lst) - even_count`. The output state reflects these calculations.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is calculated as `len(lst) - even_count`, and `odd_pairs` is calculated as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`**
