Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, and if the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] is even, then `count` is increased by 1. If the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] is even, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
