The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `j`; `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `j`; `count` is increased by 1**
