The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `j` is `i + 2`, and `count` is increased by 1**
