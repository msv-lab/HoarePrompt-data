Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `j`. If the integers at indices `i` and `j` are both even or both odd, then `count` is increased by 1. If they are of different parity, `count` remains unchanged.***
