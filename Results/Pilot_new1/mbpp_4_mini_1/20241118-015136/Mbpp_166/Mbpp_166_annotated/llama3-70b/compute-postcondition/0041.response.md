Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either both even or both odd. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums)` is greater than 1, `i` will range from 0 to `len(nums) - 2`, and for each `i`, `j` will range from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. If there are no valid pairs (i.e., all integers are of different parity), `count` will reflect that by remaining unchanged.**
