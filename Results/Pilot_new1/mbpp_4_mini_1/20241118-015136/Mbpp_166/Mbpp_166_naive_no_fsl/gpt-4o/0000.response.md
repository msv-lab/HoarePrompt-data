To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and see if it accurately counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Analysis of the Problem Description:
1. **XOR and Even Numbers**: The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd. This means:
   - An even number XORed with another even number results in an even number.
   - An odd number XORed with another odd number results in an even number.
   - An even number XORed with an odd number results in an odd number.

### Breakdown of the Program:
- The function counts the number of even and odd integers in the list:
  - `even_count` counts how many integers are even.
  - `odd_count` is derived from the total length of the list minus `even_count`.
  
- It calculates the number of pairs of even integers using the formula `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`.
- It calculates the number of pairs of odd integers using the formula `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`.
  
- Finally, it returns the sum of both counts.

### Testing the Function:
1. **Test Case 1**: `func_1([5, 4, 7, 2, 1])`
   - Even numbers: 4, 2 (2 even numbers) → Pairs = 1
   - Odd numbers: 5, 7, 1 (3 odd numbers) → Pairs = 3
   - Total pairs = 1 + 3 = 4 (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2**: `func_1([7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11])`
   - Even numbers: 2, 8, 0 (3 even numbers) → Pairs = 3
   - Odd numbers: 7, 1, 5, 11 (4 odd numbers) → Pairs = 6
   - Total pairs = 3 + 6 = 9 (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3**: `func_1([1, 2, 3])`
   - Even numbers: 2 (1 even number) → Pairs = 0
   - Odd numbers: 1, 3 (2 odd numbers) → Pairs = 1
   - Total pairs = 0 + 1 = 1 (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` should return 0 because there are no pairs.
- **Single Element List**: `func_1([1])` or `func_1([2])` should return 0 because a single element cannot form a pair.

### Conclusion:
The function behaves correctly for the provided test cases, and it also handles edge cases correctly (returns 0 for empty and single-element lists). Therefore, based on the analysis and the test cases checked, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
