To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

**Problem Description:** Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

**Analysis:**

1. **Understanding XOR and Evenness:**
   - The XOR operation between two integers results in an even number if both integers are either even or both are odd. This is because:
     - Even XOR Even = Even
     - Odd XOR Odd = Even
     - Even XOR Odd = Odd
   - Therefore, to satisfy the problem description, we need to count pairs of integers that are either both even or both odd.

2. **Loop Structure:**
   - The program uses two nested loops to iterate through all unique pairs of integers in the list. The outer loop runs from index 0 to the last index, while the inner loop starts from the next index to avoid counting pairs twice.

3. **Checking Condition:**
   - The condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0` checks if the XOR of the two numbers is even. This is correct based on our understanding of XOR.

4. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - Let's consider a few edge cases:
     - If the list is empty (`[]`), the function should return `0` since there are no pairs.
     - If the list contains only one element (`[1]`), the function should also return `0` since there are no pairs.
     - If the list contains all even numbers (`[2, 4, 6]`), the function should count all pairs as valid.
     - If the list contains all odd numbers (`[1, 3, 5]`), the function should also count all pairs as valid.
     - If the list contains a mix of even and odd numbers (`[1, 2, 3, 4]`), the function should only count pairs of even-even or odd-odd.

5. **Counting Logic:**
   - The counting logic appears to be correct as it increments the count for each valid pair found.

**Conclusion:**
After analyzing the program, it correctly implements the logic to count pairs that XOR to an even number based on the conditions stated. The nested loop structure ensures that all pairs are considered, and the condition accurately checks for even results of the XOR operation.

Therefore, I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
