Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the total number of ways to choose 2 even integers and 2 odd integers from the list. It calculates the counts of even and odd integers, then computes the number of combinations of pairs from these counts. The function correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 2 even or 2 odd integers by returning 0 for those counts, thus ensuring the overall result is accurate. **
