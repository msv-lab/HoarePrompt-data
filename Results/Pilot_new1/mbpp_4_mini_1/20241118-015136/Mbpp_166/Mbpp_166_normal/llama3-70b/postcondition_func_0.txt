The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and calculates the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers have the same parity (both even or both odd). If the list has fewer than two integers, it returns 0, as no pairs can be formed. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-integer values, but it will return 0 in those scenarios due to the loop not executing.
