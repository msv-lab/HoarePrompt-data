Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, for all `j` in the range from `i + 1` to the length of `nums`. If `nums` has only one integer, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` has at least 2 integers, the loop executes for `len(nums) - (i + 1)` times, where `j` takes values from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`.**
