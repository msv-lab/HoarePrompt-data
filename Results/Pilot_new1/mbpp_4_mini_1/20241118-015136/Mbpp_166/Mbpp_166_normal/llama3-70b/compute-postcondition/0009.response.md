According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which is initialized to `i + 1` and will iterate up to `len(nums)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 2, and `j` is currently `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be adjusted to the next integer, which is `j` equal to `i + 2`. Additionally, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2` to allow the loop to execute again.

Since `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, we can assume that `len(nums)` is at least 2. To guarantee that the loop executes one more time, we must ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, count is 2, j is `i + 2`**
