According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 integer, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `nums` list must have at least 1 integer, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting index for the loop.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 integer, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
