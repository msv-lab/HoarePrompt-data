According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `nums`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`, which means that `i` must be less than `len(nums) - 1`. Given that `len(nums)` is at least 2, this condition can be satisfied as long as `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.

Before the loop starts, `count` is the number of pairs, and `i` is less than `len(nums)`, but we need to ensure that `i` is also less than `len(nums) - 1` for the loop to execute. Therefore, we can adjust `i` to be `len(nums) - 2` or less, which allows `j` to start from `i + 1`.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `len(nums)` is at least 2**
