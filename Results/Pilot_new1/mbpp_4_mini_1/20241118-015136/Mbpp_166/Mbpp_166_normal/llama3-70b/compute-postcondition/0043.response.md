The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both numbers are either even or odd, which is stored in the variable 'count'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the count of pairs of integers that are both even or both odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums and returns the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both numbers are either even or odd.**
