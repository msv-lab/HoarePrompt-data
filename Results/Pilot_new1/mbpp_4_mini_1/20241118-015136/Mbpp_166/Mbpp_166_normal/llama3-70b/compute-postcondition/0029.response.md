Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd, `len(nums)` is at least 2, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `len(nums) - 1`, and the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either even or odd.***
