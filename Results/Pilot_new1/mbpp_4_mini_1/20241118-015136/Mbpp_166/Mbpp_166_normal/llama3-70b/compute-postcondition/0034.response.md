Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both numbers are either even or odd. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are both even or both odd (i.e., their XOR is even), then `count` is increased by 1. If they are of different parity, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, it is ensured that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, confirming the validity of indices `i` and `j`.***
