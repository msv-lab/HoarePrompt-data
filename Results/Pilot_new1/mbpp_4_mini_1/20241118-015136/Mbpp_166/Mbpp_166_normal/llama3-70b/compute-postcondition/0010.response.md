The variable `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. Other variables, such as `nums` and `j`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `count` is 3, `j` is `i + 2`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 integers, `count` is 3, `j` is `i + 2**
