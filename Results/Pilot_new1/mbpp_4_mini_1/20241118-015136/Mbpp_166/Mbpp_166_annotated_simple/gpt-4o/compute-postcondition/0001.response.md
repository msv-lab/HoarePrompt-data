The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of `len(lst) - even_count`. The `len(lst)` function calculates the total number of integers in the list `lst`, and then subtracts `even_count` from it to determine the count of odd integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`**
