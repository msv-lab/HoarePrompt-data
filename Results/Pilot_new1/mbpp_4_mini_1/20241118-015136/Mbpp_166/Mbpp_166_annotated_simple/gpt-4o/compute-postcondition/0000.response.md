The code counts the number of even integers in the list `lst` by using a generator expression that iterates through each element `x` in `lst`. For each even integer (where `x % 2 == 0`), it contributes `1` to the sum. The value of `even_count` will be the total number of even integers found in `lst`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst**.
