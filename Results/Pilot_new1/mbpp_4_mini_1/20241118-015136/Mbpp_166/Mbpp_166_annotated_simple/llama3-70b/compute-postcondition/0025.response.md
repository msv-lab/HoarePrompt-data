According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop is set to iterate from `i + 1` to `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, which means `i + 1` is still a valid starting point for `j`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`, which means the next value of `j` should be `i + 2` (the next value after the current `j`).

Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, and we need to adjust `j` to be `i + 3` for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i + 3` is still less than `len(nums)`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `j`.

State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`**
