According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and increments `j` with each iteration. 

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2` (which means there are at least 3 elements in `nums` starting from `i`).
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `j` is `i + 2` at the end of the last iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to `i + 3`. Since `j` is currently `i + 2`, we need to adjust `j` to `i + 3`. 

The condition `len(nums) > i + 2` ensures that there are enough elements for `j` to be `i + 3`. Thus, we do not need to adjust the `len(nums)` condition, as it already satisfies the requirements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 3`, and `count` remains unchanged**
