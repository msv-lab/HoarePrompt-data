According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 1` up to `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is such that `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, allowing `j` to be `i + 1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must remain unchanged, and `j` must increment to the next index. Therefore, if `i` is still valid, `j` will be incremented to `i + 2` for the next iteration, and the loop will check the next element in `nums`.

Since `nums` is stated to have at least 2 integers, it is guaranteed that `len(nums) > 1`, and thus `i` can be adjusted accordingly to reflect the next iteration. 

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 2`**
