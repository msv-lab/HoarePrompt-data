The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The previous state of `nums` is not affected by this assignment, and no other variables are changed. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `count` while leaving `nums` unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `count` is 0**
