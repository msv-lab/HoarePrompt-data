Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (i, j) where `i` is fixed and `j` ranges from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even. If `len(nums)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is exactly 2, the loop executes once. If `len(nums)` is greater than 2, the loop executes `len(nums) - i - 1` times, where `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`.**
