According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`, which means `i` must be at least 0 and less than `len(nums) - 1`. The variable `count` is not directly relevant to the loop's ability to execute, but it is important to note that it counts pairs (i, j). 

For the loop to execute, `i` must be set to a value such that `i + 1` is valid in the range. Thus, `i` should be less than `len(nums) - 1`. 

State: **`len(nums)` remains unchanged, `count` is the number of pairs (i, j), `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`**
