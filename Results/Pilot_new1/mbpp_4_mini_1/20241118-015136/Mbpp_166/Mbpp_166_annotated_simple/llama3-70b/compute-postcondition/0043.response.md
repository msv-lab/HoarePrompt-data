The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the number of pairs (i, j) such that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either both even or both odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the count of pairs of indices where the integers at those indices share the same parity (both even or both odd). 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers, and returns the number of pairs (i, j) such that both nums[i] and nums[j] are either both even or both odd.**
