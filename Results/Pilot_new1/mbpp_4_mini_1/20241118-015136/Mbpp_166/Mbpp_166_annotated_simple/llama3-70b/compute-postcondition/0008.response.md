Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, then `j` is equal to `i + 1`. The condition for the XOR being even implies that both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are either both even or both odd. Therefore, if the XOR is even, `count` reflects the increment accordingly.***
