The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, but it will be increased by 1. The other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 integers, `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `i + 1**
