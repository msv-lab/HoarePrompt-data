Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if there are any `None` values in the given tuple. It iterates through each item in the tuple and returns `True` if it encounters a `None` value. If no `None` values are found after checking all items, it returns `False`. 

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases. The function will return `True` for tuples containing at least one `None` value and `False` for tuples without any `None` values. There are no edge cases or missing logic in the function based on the problem description.
