Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to check if any element in the given tuple `tup` is `None`. However, the logic implemented in the function returns `True` if any element is `None`, which contradicts the requirement stated in the problem description. The problem description implies that the function should return `True` if there are no `None` values in the tuple, and `False` if there is at least one `None` value. 

For example:
- Input: `(1, 2, 3)` should return `True` (no `None` values).
- Input: `(1, None, 3)` should return `False` (there is a `None` value).

Since the function does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, it is considered incorrect.
