Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values. However, it has a critical flaw: if the tuple is empty, the function does not return any value, which leads to an implicit return of `None`. 

Here are the potential cases where the program does not work as expected:

1. **Empty Tuple Case**: If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the loop does not execute, and the function reaches the end without returning a value. This results in an implicit return of `None`, which does not align with the expected behavior of returning `False` when there are no `None` values in the tuple.

2. **Non-None Values Case**: If the tuple contains only non-None values, the function will correctly return `False`. However, since the function can return `None` for an empty tuple, it does not meet the requirement of consistently returning a boolean value.

Due to these issues, particularly the handling of the empty tuple case, the function does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the correctness of the program is deemed **False**.
