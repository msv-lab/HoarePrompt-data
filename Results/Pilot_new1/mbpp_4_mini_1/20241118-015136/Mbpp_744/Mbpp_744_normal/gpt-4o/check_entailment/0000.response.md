The provided code is designed to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function `func_1(tup)` iterates over each item in the tuple `tup`.
2. If it encounters a `None`, it returns `True`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding a `None`, it returns `False`.

### Edge Cases:
- An important edge case to consider is when the input tuple is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` if all elements are non-None or if the tuple is empty. However, the code does not explicitly handle the empty tuple case; it will return `False` since the loop will not execute, which is technically correct but not explicitly mentioned.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function returns `True` if any element in `tup` is `None`, and `False` if all elements are non-None or if `tup` is empty. This aligns with the behavior of the code, as it will return `False` for an empty tuple.

### Conclusion:
The code behaves as expected according to the problem description and the output hints. It correctly identifies `None` values and returns `False` for an empty tuple. Since there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
