Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item. If the first item in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)` where `item` is the first item. If the first item is not a list, `flat_list` contains `item`, which is the first item in `nested_list`. In both cases, `flat_list` will contain either the flattened result of the first item if it's a list or that first item itself if it's not.***
