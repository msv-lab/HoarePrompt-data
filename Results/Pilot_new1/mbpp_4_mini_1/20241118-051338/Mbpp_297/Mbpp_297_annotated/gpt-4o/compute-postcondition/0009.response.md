The code appends `item` to `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` contains at least 2 items, and `item` is the second item in `nested_list`. Therefore, `item` has a specific value corresponding to the second item in the list. The state of `flat_list` will change as `item` is added to it, but we do not know the previous contents of `flat_list`. 

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`, and `item` is appended to `flat_list`.**
