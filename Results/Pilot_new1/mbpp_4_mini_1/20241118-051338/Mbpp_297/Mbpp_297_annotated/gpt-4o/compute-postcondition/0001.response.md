According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list contains at least one item, the loop will execute. Since `flat_list` is an empty list, it does not affect the execution of the loop. For the loop to be executed, the `nested_list` must contain at least one item, and `item` should be set to the first item in the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`**
