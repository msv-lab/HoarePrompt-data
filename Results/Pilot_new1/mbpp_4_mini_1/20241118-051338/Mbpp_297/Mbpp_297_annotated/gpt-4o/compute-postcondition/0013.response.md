The code appends the value of `item` to the `flat_list`. The variable `item` represents the third item in the `nested_list`, which is not specified but is guaranteed to exist since the initial state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 3 items. The state of `flat_list` is affected by adding `item`, but the previous values of `flat_list` are not provided, so we cannot specify its new state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `nested_list` and the action of appending `item` to `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items; `item` is the third item in the list, and `item` has been appended to `flat_list`.**
