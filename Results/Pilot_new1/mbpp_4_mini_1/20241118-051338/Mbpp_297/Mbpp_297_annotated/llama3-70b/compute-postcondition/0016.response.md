Output State: **`flat_list` contains all the elements of `nested_list` flattened, meaning if any element is a list, its contents are included in `flat_list` via `func_1(element)`. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute and `flat_list` remains empty. If `nested_list` contains only non-list elements, `flat_list` will contain all those elements directly. If `nested_list` contains a mix of lists and non-list elements, `flat_list` will include a combination of both, reflecting the flattened structure.**
