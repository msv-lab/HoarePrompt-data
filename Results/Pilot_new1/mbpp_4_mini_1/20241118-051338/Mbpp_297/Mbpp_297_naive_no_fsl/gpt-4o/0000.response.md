Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. It handles various cases, including:

1. **Single-level lists**: It correctly appends non-list items to the `flat_list`.
2. **Multi-level nested lists**: It recursively calls itself for any list it encounters, ensuring that all levels of nesting are flattened into a single list.
3. **Empty lists**: If an empty list is passed, it returns an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
4. **Mixed types**: The function works with lists containing different types of elements (integers, strings, etc.), though the provided test cases only include integers.

The test cases provided in the assertions all produce the expected results, confirming that the function performs correctly for those scenarios. Given that I cannot think of any edge cases where the function would fail, I conclude that the program is correct.
