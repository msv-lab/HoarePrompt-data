Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a recursive function to flatten a nested list structure. It checks each element in the input list; if an element is itself a list, it recursively calls the function to flatten that sublist and extends the flat list with the result. If the element is not a list, it simply appends it to the flat list.

Here are the reasons why the code is correct:

1. **Handles Multiple Levels of Nesting**: The recursion allows the function to handle lists that are nested at any level, effectively flattening them into a single list.
2. **Correctly Identifies Non-list Elements**: The use of `isinstance(element, list)` ensures that only lists are treated as nested structures. Other data types (integers, strings, etc.) are directly appended to the result.
3. **Extends the Flat List Appropriately**: The use of `flat_list.extend(func_1(element))` correctly merges the flattened sublist into the main flat list.

The function will work correctly for a variety of test cases, including:
- An empty list `[]` returns `[]`.
- A flat list `[1, 2, 3]` returns `[1, 2, 3]`.
- A nested list `[[1, 2], [3, [4]]]` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- A deeply nested list like `[[[[1], 2], 3], 4]` returns `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Since I cannot identify any case where the function fails to meet the requirements described, I conclude that the program is correct.
