The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged as the code does not manipulate it. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists; `flat_list` is an empty list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists; `flat_list` is an empty list**
