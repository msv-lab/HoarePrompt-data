Output State: **`flat_list` contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and the flattened contents of any nested lists found within it. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute and `flat_list` remains empty. If `nested_list` contains at least one element, `flat_list` will be updated accordingly based on the type of each `element` processed.**
