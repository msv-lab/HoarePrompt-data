The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a list called `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements extracted from `nested_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a new list containing all non-list elements from that list, regardless of how deeply nested they are. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists, and returns a list containing all non-list elements from nested_list.**
