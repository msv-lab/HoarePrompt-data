According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element, and `element` was the first element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, and `element` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, element is the second element in the list**
