The code appends `item` to `flat_list`. The `nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 items, and `item` is specifically the second item in that list. The state of `flat_list` changes by adding the value of `item` to it, while the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`**
