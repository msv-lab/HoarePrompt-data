The provided program is designed to flatten a nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle elements that are lists, extracting and appending all non-list elements to a flat list.

### Initial Assessment:
The function `func_1` iterates through each item in the `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it appends the item directly to `flat_list`. This approach appears to be correct for flattening nested lists.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list, the function should return an empty list, which it does.
2. **Single Level List**: If the input is a flat list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`), it should return the same list, which it does.
3. **Deeply Nested Lists**: The function should handle multiple levels of nesting (e.g., `[[1, [2, 3]], 4]` should return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`), which it does.
4. **Non-List Elements**: If the input contains non-list elements (e.g., `[1, 'a', [2, 'b']]`), it should return `[1, 'a', 2, 'b']`, which it does.

Thus, the function seems to cover various edge cases effectively.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function accepts a list called `nested_list`, which can contain integers, other non-list elements, or nested lists, and that it recursively flattens the list. It also mentions that if `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. These hints align with the code's behavior.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the output hints, I find that the function correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description. It handles all the edge cases mentioned and returns the expected results.

Correctness: **True**.
