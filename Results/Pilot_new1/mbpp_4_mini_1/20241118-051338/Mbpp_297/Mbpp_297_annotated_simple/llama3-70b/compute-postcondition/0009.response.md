The code `flat_list.append(element)` appends the value of `element`, which is the second element in the list `nested_list`, to the list `flat_list`. The `flat_list` is modified to include this new value, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `flat_list` with the new element added.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements; `flat_list` is updated to include the second element from `nested_list`.**
