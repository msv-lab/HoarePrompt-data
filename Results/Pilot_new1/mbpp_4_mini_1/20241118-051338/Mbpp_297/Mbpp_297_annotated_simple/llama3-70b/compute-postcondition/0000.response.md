The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `nested_list` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of `nested_list` and the new state of `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers, other lists, or a combination of both; `flat_list` is an empty list**
