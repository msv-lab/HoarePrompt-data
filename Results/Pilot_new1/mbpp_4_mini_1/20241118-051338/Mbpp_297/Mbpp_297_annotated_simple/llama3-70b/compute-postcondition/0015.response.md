According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 3 elements and `element` is the third element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 4 elements, and `element` should be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 4 elements, `element` is the fourth element in the list.**
