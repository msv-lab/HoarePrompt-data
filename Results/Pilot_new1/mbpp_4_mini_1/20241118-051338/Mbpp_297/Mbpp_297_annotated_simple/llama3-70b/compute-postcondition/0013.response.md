The code appends the value of `element` (which is the third element in the list `nested_list`) to the list `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, so `element` is defined and has a specific value. The state of `flat_list` is not provided, but it will have `element` added to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `element`.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `element`.**
