The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` calls the function `func_1` with `item` as an argument and extends `flat_list` with the result. The previous state indicates that `flat_list` is an empty list and `item` is a list with at least one item. The function `func_1(item)` is expected to return a list (the flattened version of `item`).

Since `item` is a list with at least one item, `func_1(item)` will return a list containing the elements of `item`. Thus, `flat_list` will be updated to include the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

The output state reflects the new contents of `flat_list` after the extension. Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` is now a list with the elements from `func_1(item)`, and `item` is a list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 item, `flat_list` is now a list with the elements from `func_1(item)`, and `item` is a list**
