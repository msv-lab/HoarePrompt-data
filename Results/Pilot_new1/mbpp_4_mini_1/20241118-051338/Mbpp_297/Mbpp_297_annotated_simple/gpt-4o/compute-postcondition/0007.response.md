According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 2 items, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 item. For the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 items. The current `item` being processed is the first item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, item is the second item in the list**
