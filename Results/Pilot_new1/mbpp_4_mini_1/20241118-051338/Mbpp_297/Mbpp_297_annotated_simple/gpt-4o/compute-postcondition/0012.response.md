The `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list`. The exact contents of `flat_list` and the return value of `func_1(item)` depend on the specific implementation of `func_1` and the items in `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` is guaranteed to have at least 3 items, `flat_list` will have additional elements added to it based on the output of `func_1`. 

The output state reflects that `flat_list` now contains its previous values along with the new values produced by `func_1(item)` for each item in `nested_list`, but without knowing the specifics of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values added.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, and `flat_list` is extended with the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list`.**
