Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The method `replace` is utilized accurately to achieve this, and it handles all potential cases, including:

1. A string with multiple spaces.
2. A string with no spaces at all.
3. A string that consists entirely of spaces.
4. A string with leading or trailing spaces.

Since the function works as intended for all these scenarios and there are no edge cases that would cause it to fail in replacing spaces, the code meets the requirements of the problem description. Thus, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
