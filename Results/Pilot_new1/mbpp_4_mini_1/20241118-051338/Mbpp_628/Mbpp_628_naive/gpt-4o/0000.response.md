Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The `replace` method in Python works as intended for this task. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves correctly for the given test cases. Additionally, the function should handle edge cases such as:

1. An empty string (`''`), which would return an empty string.
2. A string with no spaces (`'HelloWorld'`), which should return the same string without modification.
3. A string consisting only of spaces (`'     '`), which would return `'%20%20%20%20%20'`.

Since all these cases will work as expected and the function fulfills the requirements of the problem description, the function is correct.
