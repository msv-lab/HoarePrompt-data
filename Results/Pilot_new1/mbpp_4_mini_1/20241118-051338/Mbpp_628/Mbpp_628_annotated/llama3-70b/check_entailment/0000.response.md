Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the case where the input `s` is `None` or not a string. This could lead to a `TypeError` when the `replace` method is called on a `None` value or a non-string type. 

For example, if the input is `None`, the code would raise an error:

```python
func_1(None)
```

This input would not be handled by the program, violating the expectations set by the problem description, which implies that the function should correctly process any valid input string. The annotations also mention that the function does not handle cases where `s` is `None` or not a string. This confirms that there are indeed edge cases that the code does not cover, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect. 

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
