Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input is `None` or not a string, which could lead to errors. For example, if the input is `None`, calling `replace` on it will raise an `AttributeError`. The annotations mention that the function does not handle such cases, which means it does not meet the problem description's requirement for all potential inputs. Therefore, since it fails to correctly handle edge cases, the program is incorrect.
