Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and returns its uppercase version using the built-in `upper()` method. This method is designed to convert all lowercase letters in the string to uppercase, while leaving any characters that are already uppercase or non-alphabetic unchanged.

I cannot think of any potential cases where the program would not work as expected. For example:
- If the input is an empty string `""`, the output will also be `""`, which is correct.
- If the input is already in uppercase, like `"HELLO"`, the output will be the same: `"HELLO"`, which is also correct.
- If the input contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, such as `"Hello World"`, the output will be `"HELLO WORLD"`, which meets the requirement.
- If the input contains non-alphabetic characters, such as `"123 abc!"`, the output will be `"123 ABC!"`, which is again correct.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
