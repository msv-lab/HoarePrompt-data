The provided program is designed to convert a given string to uppercase using the `upper()` method. 

Initial assessment:
- The function `func_1(s: str) -> str` takes a string `s` as input and returns its uppercase version.
- The `upper()` method is a built-in Python function that converts all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase, which aligns with the problem description.

However, I need to consider edge cases:
- If the input `s` is `None`, calling `s.upper()` would raise an `AttributeError` since `None` does not have an `upper()` method. This is a significant edge case that the function does not handle.

Now, let's examine the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function does not handle cases where `s` may be `None`, which could lead to an `AttributeError`. This aligns with the edge case I identified.

Given that the program does not handle the case where `s` is `None`, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input string `s` is `None`, which would lead to an error. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
