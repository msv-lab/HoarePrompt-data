Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the functionality to convert a given string to uppercase using the built-in `upper()` method. This method handles all potential cases, including:

1. Lowercase letters: It converts all lowercase letters in the string to their uppercase equivalents.
2. Uppercase letters: It leaves uppercase letters unchanged.
3. Non-alphabetic characters: It does not alter numbers, punctuation, or whitespace.
4. Empty strings: It correctly returns an empty string as the output.

Since the implementation adheres to the problem description and works correctly for all potential input cases, it is deemed correct.
