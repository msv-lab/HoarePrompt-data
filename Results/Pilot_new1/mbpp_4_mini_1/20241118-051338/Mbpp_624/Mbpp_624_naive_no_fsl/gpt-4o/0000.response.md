Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to convert a given string to uppercase using the `upper()` method. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function works as expected for various input cases, including lowercase and mixed-case strings. 

Additionally, the program handles edge cases such as:
- An empty string, which would return an empty string (i.e., `func_1('') == ''`).
- Strings that are already in uppercase, which would return the same string (i.e., `func_1('ALREADYUPPERCASE') == 'ALREADYUPPERCASE'`).
- Strings with non-alphabetic characters, which are unaffected by the conversion (i.e., `func_1('1234!@#$') == '1234!@#$'`).

Since I cannot think of any input where the function fails to convert the string to uppercase as described, I conclude that the code is correct in all potential cases.
