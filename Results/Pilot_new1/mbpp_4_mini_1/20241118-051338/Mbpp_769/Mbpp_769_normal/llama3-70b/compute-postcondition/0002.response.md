Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, effectively computing the symmetric difference of the two lists. It handles cases where the lists may contain duplicate elements or be empty, ensuring the result is unique and sorted. **
