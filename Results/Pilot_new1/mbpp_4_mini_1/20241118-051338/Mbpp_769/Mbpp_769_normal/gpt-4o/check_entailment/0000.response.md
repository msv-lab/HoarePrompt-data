To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code and the problem description.

**Problem description:** The function should return a sorted list of unique elements that are in either list but not in both, sorted based on their original indices from the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    diff_elements = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
    result_list = list(diff_elements)
    result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))
    return result_list
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either list but not in both, sorted based on their original indices from the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`.

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The code uses sets to calculate the symmetric difference between `list1` and `list2`, which is correct for finding elements that are in either list but not in both.
2. The resulting list is then sorted based on the indices from the concatenated `list1` and `list2`, which aligns with the requirement to sort based on original indices.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. If both lists are empty, the function should return an empty list.
2. If one list is empty and the other contains elements, the function should return all elements from the non-empty list.
3. If both lists contain the same elements, the function should return an empty list.
4. If there are duplicate elements in either list, the function should still return unique elements.

**Checking Output Hints:**
The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the code. They mention that the function returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either list but not in both, sorted based on their original indices from the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. 

**Testing the Edge Cases:**
- For the case where both lists are empty:
  ```python
  assert func_1([], []) == []
  ```
- For the case where one list is empty:
  ```python
  assert func_1([], [1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3], []) == [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- For the case where both lists are the same:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) == []
  ```
- For the case with duplicates:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 3], [1, 2]) == [3]
  ```

The program handles these edge cases correctly.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement and handles potential edge cases as well. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
