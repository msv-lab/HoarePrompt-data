The variable `result_list` is assigned the value of `list(diff_elements)`, which converts the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2` (stored in `diff_elements`) into a list. The previous values of `set1`, `list2`, `set2`, and `diff_elements` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the conversion of `diff_elements` into a list.

Output State: **`set1` is a set created from `list1`; `list2` remains unchanged; `set2` is a set created from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`; `result_list` is a list created from `diff_elements`.**
