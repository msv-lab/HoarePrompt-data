The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of elements that can be compared for equality. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list called `result_list`, which is based on the indices in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list that is formed from the elements of both lists based on their combined indices. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list based on the indices in the concatenated list of list1 and list2.**
