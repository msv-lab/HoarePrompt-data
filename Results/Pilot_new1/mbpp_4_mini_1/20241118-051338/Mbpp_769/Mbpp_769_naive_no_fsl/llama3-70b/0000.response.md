Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement to get the difference between two lists. The operation used in the program, `set(list1) ^ set(list2)`, computes the symmetric difference between the two sets, which includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. 

For example, consider the following input:

```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [2, 3, 4]
```

The expected output for the difference between `list1` and `list2` (i.e., elements in `list1` that are not in `list2`) should be `[1]`. However, the program would return `[1, 4]` because it includes all elements that are unique to each list.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description's requirement for calculating the difference between two lists, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
