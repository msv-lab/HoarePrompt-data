To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior with various inputs.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Functionality**: The function is supposed to compute the difference between two lists, which generally means finding elements that are present in one list but not in the other. However, the implementation uses `symmetric_difference` which returns elements that are in either of the sets but not in both, effectively giving us elements that belong to one list or the other, rather than just the difference.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The result list is sorted based on the index of the elements in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. This means that the order of the output depends on the original order of the elements in the input lists.

### Testing with Provided Assertions:

- **Assertion 1**: 
  ```python
  assert func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35]) == [10, 20, 30, 15]
  ```
  - Expected difference: `[10, 15, 20, 30]` (elements in list1 not in list2)
  - Output: `[10, 20, 30, 15]` (incorrect)
  
- **Assertion 2**:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
  ```
  - Expected difference: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Output: `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` (correct)

- **Assertion 3**:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 6, 7]
  ```
  - Expected difference: `[2, 3, 6, 7]`
  - Output: `[2, 3, 6, 7]` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The first assertion fails because the output does not match the expected difference. The function does not correctly compute the difference between the two lists as described in the problem statement, since it uses symmetric difference instead of a proper difference operation.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not work correctly for at least one case, specifically for the first assertion, which indicates that it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
