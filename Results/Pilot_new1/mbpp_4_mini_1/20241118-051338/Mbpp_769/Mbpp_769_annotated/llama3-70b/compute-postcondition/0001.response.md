The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing hashable elements. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, which is known as the symmetric difference of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of hashable elements and return a sorted list of their symmetric difference. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both (the symmetric difference of list1 and list2).**
