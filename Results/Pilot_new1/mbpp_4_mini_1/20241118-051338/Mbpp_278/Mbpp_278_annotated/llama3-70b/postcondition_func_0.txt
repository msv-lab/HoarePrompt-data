The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first element that is itself a tuple. If no tuple is found, it returns the length of `tup`. If `tup` is empty, it returns 0. Note that if there are no tuples in `tup`, the function does not explicitly return `None`, which is implied in the annotations.
