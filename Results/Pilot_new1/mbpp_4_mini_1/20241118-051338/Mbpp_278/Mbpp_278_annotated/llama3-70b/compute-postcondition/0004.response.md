According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the tuple `tup`. If `tup` contains at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the tuple. For the loop to be executed one more time, `tup` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` should be the second element in the tuple.

State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the tuple**
