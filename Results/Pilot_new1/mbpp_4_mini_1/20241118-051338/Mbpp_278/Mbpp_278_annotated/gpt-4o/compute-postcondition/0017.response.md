The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that may contain elements, and it is assumed to contain at least one element. The function returns the number of non-tuple elements in `tup` before the first tuple is encountered. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the count of non-tuple elements that appear before the first tuple within it.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, which is a tuple, and returns the number of non-tuple elements in tup before the first tuple is encountered.**
