Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, and `elem` is the first element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `elem` is not a tuple, the program continues execution without any changes to `count` or `elem`.***
