Let's analyze the provided code and its relation to the problem description and output hints.

**Problem Description:** The function is supposed to find the number of elements that occur before the first tuple element in the given tuple.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(tup):
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            return tup.index(elem)
    return len(tup)
```

**Output Hints:** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first element that is itself a tuple. If no elements in `tup` are tuples, it returns the length of `tup`. If `tup` is empty, the function implicitly returns None.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function iterates through the elements of the tuple `tup`.
2. If it finds an element that is a tuple, it returns the index of that element using `tup.index(elem)`.
3. If no tuples are found, it returns the length of `tup`.
4. If `tup` is empty, the function will reach the return statement `return len(tup)`, which is `0`, not `None`.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `tup` is empty, the function will return `0`, which is not what the output hints suggest (it states it implicitly returns None).
2. If the first element is a tuple, it correctly returns `0`, which is expected.
3. If there are no tuples in the tuple, it correctly returns the length of `tup`. However, if `tup` has only non-tuple elements, it will return the length correctly.
4. The use of `tup.index(elem)` could be problematic if there are multiple identical tuples in the tuple, as it will always return the index of the first occurrence.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints state that if no elements are tuples, it returns the length of `tup`, which aligns with the code. However, the hints also mention returning `None` for an empty tuple, which is incorrect based on the code logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly in all potential cases. Specifically:
- It does not return `None` for an empty tuple, but `0` instead.
- It could potentially mislead users regarding the index of the first tuple if multiple identical tuples exist.

Given these points, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description and has discrepancies with the output hints.

Correctness: **False**.
