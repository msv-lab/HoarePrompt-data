To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to find the number of elements that occur before the first tuple element in a given tuple.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    count = 0
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            break
        count += 1
    return count
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The function initializes a `count` variable to zero.
2. It iterates through each element in the input tuple `tup`.
3. If it encounters an element that is a tuple (`isinstance(elem, tuple)`), it breaks out of the loop.
4. For every element that is not a tuple, it increments the `count`.
5. Finally, it returns the `count`.

### Test Cases:
The function has been tested with the following assertions:
- `assert func_1((1, 5, 7, (4, 6), 10)) == 3`
- `assert func_1((2, 9, (5, 7), 11)) == 2`
- `assert func_1((11, 15, 5, 8, (2, 3), 8)) == 4`

### Edge Cases:
1. **Empty Tuple**: If the input is an empty tuple `()`, the function will return `0`, which is correct since there are no elements before a tuple.
2. **No Tuple Present**: For a tuple without any nested tuple, like `(1, 2, 3)`, the count should be `3`, but it will return `3` as expected.
3. **Tuple at Start**: If the tuple starts with a tuple, like `((1, 2), 3, 4)`, the function will return `0`, which is also correct.

### Finding a Potential Case:
The function does not handle the case where the input is a single tuple, for example:
- `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4))` should return `4`, and it does.
- However, if we test with a tuple that contains only a tuple, such as `func_1(((1, 2),))`, it will return `0`, which is correct.

After considering various cases, including edge cases, I find that the function behaves correctly according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Since the function correctly counts the number of elements before the first tuple in all tested and potential edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
