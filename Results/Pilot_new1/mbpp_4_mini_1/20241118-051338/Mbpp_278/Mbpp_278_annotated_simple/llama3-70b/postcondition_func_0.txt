The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first element in `tup` that is itself a tuple. If no such element exists, it returns the total number of elements in `tup`. If `tup` is empty, the function will return the length of `tup`, which is 0. However, if there are no tuples and `tup` is not empty, the function will still return the length of `tup`. There is no explicit handling for cases where `tup` could contain only non-tuple elements, but the return value will simply be the length of `tup` in such cases.
