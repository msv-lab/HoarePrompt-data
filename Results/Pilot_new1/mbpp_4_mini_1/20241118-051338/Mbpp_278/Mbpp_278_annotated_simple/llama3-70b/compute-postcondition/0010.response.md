According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If `tup` contains at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` contains at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in the tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` must be updated to the fourth element in the tuple, and the index of `elem` should also reflect that.

State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the tuple**
