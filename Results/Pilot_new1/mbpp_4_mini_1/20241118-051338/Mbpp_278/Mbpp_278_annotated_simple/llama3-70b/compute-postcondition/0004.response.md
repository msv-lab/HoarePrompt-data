According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `tup`. If `tup` contains more than one element, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple containing at least one element. To ensure the loop can execute again, `tup` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` should be the second element in `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the tuple**
