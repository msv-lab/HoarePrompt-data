Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `tup` before the first nested tuple is encountered. If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If the first element of `tup` is a nested tuple, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `tup` contains only non-tuple elements, `count` will equal the length of `tup`.**
