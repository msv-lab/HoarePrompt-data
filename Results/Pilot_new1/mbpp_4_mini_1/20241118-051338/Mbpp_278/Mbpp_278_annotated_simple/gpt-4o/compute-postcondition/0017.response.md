The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that may contain elements of any type, including nested tuples. The function returns the number of non-tuple elements in the tuple `tup` before the first nested tuple is encountered. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to count and return the number of non-tuple elements in the provided tuple `tup` until a nested tuple is found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, which is a tuple, and returns the count of non-tuple elements in tup before the first nested tuple is encountered.**
