Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least two sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list, and `max_length` is a non-negative integer. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged. The length of `sublist` is at least 0, ensuring that `max_length` is always a non-negative integer.***
