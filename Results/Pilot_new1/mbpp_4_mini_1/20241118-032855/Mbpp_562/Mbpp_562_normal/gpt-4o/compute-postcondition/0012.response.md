Output State: **`max_length` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop does not execute and `max_length` remains 0. If `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `max_length` will be updated based on the lengths of the sublists, ensuring it is always non-negative.**
