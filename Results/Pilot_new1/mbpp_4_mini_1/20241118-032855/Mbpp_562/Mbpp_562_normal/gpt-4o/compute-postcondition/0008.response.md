According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 sublists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 sublists, and `sublist` should be the third sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list, `max_length` is a non-negative integer**
