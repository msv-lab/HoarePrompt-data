The value of `max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length can vary depending on the contents of that sublist. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `max_length` based on the length of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least two sublists; `sublist` is the second sublist in the list; `max_length` is the length of `sublist`.**
