The function accepts a list of lists and returns the length of the longest sublist. If the input list is empty or contains empty sublists, the function will still operate but may not behave as expected, as it assumes all sublists are non-empty. Therefore, if there are no sublists, it could raise a ValueError when trying to determine the maximum length.
