Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least 3 sublists. If the length of the third sublist is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of the third sublist. If the length of the third sublist is less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged.***
