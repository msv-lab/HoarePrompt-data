Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the length of the longest sublists, but it does not handle the case where the input `lists` may be empty. If `lists` is an empty list, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError` because there are no elements to determine a maximum from. Therefore, the program fails for this potential case, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
