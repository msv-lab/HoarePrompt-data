Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list, and `max_length` is either the length of the second sublist or the length of `sublist` if `sublist` has a length greater than `max_length`. If `sublist` has a length less than or equal to `max_length`, then `max_length` remains unchanged.***
