The value of `max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, and its length is greater than 0, `max_length` will be a positive integer representing that length. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, `max_length` is the length of `sublist`**
