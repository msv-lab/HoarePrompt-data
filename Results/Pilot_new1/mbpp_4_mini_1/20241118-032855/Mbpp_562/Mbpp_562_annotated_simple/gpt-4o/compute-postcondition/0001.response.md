According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. The variable `max_length` does not affect the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist, and the `sublist` will be the first sublist in the list.

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list, `max_length` is 0**
