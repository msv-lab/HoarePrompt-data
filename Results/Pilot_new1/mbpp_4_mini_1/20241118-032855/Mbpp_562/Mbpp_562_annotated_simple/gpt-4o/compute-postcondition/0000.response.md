The variable `max_length` is initialized to 0. Since it is the only variable affected and there are no previous values to consider for `max_length`, the output state reflects this initialization. The other variable `list_of_lists` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_length` is 0**
