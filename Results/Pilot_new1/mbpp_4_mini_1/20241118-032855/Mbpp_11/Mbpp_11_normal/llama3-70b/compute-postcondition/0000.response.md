The variable `first_occ` is assigned the value of `s.find(c)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is not found in `s`, it will return -1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a single character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, and `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found**
