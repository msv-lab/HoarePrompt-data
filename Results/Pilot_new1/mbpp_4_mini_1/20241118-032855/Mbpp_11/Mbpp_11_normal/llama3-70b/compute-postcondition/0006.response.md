Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1, the function returns a new string formed by removing the first occurrence of `c`, followed by the substring between the first and last occurrences of `c`, and the substring following the last occurrence of `c`. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.***
