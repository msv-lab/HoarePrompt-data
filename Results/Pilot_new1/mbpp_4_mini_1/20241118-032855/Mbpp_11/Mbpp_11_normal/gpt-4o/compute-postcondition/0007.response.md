Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found in `s`, or if `ch` appears only once in `s`. If `ch` appears more than once, it returns the string `s` with both the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.**
