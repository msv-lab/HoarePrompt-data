The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. 

- In Case 1, if the first occurrence index (`first_index`) of `ch` in `s` is -1 (not found), or if the last occurrence index (`last_index`) is -1 (not found), or if both indices are equal, the function returns the original string `s`.

- In Case 2, if the conditions of Case 1 are not met, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` removed. If either index is -1 or both are equal, it returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return the original string or a modified version of the string based on the occurrences of `ch`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not found or if both occurrences are equal; otherwise, it returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.**
