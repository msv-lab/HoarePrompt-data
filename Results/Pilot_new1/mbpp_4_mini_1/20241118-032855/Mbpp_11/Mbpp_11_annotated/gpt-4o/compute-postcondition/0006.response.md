The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. 

In Case 1, if `ch` is not found in `s` (indicated by `first_index` or `last_index` being -1), or if `ch` appears only once in `s` (indicated by `first_index` equaling `last_index`), the function returns `s` unchanged. 

In Case 2, if `ch` occurs more than once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the character `ch` removed from both its first and last occurrences.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and based on the occurrences of `ch` in `s`, either return `s` unchanged or return `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns `s` unchanged if `ch` is not found or appears only once; otherwise, it returns `s` with `ch` removed from its first and last occurrences.**
