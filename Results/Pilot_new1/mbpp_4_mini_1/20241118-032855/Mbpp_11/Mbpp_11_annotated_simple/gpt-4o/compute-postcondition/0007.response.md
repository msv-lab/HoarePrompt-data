Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not present in `s` or appears only once; otherwise, it returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. If `ch` appears multiple times, the function correctly handles the removal of only the first and last instances, while preserving the rest of the string. **
