The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. After executing the function body, the function checks the indices of `ch` in `s`. 

- If either the first index or the last index of `ch` is -1 (indicating that `ch` is not present in `s`), or if both indices are equal (indicating that `ch` appears only once), the function returns the original string `s`.
- If both indices are valid and different, the function returns the string `s` with the character `ch` removed from its first and last occurrences.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return the original string `s` if `ch` is not present or appears only once, or return the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed if `ch` appears multiple times. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, returns the original string `s` if `ch` is not present or appears only once; otherwise, it returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed.**
