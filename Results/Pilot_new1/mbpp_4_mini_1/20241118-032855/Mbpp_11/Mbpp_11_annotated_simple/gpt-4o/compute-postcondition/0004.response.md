Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, and `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found. If `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or both indices are equal, the function returns the original string `s`, indicating that `ch` is either not present in `s` or appears only once.***
