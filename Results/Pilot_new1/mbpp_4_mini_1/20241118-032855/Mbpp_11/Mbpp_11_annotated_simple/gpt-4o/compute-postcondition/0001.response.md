The variable `last_index` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which returns the highest index of the substring `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, it returns -1. The value of `first_index` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state depends on the values of `s` and `ch`. 

If `ch` is found in `s`, `last_index` will be the index of the last occurrence of `ch`. If `ch` is not found, `last_index` will be -1. The initial state indicates that `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, but we do not have specific values to determine the exact output.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if not found**
