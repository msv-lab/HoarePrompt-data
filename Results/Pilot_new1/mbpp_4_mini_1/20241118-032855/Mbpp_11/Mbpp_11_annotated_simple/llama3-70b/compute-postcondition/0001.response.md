The variable `last_occ` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(c)`, which finds the last occurrence of the character `c` in the string `s`. The value of `last_occ` will be the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found. The previous values of `s`, `c`, and `first_occ` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the new value of `last_occ`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a single character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found**
