To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its behavior against the problem description, which requires removing the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

Let's break down the provided program:

```python
def func_1(s, c):
    first_occ = s.find(c)
    last_occ = s.rfind(c)
    if first_occ != -1 and last_occ != -1:
        return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - `first_occ = s.find(c)` finds the index of the first occurrence of character `c`.
   - `last_occ = s.rfind(c)` finds the index of the last occurrence of character `c`.

2. **Removing Occurrences**:
   - If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are found (i.e., not equal to -1), the program constructs a new string by:
     - Taking the substring before the first occurrence.
     - Skipping the first occurrence (`s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]`), which incorrectly retains characters between the first and last occurrence.
     - Taking the substring after the last occurrence.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the character `c` is not present in the string, it returns the original string.
   - If `c` appears only once in the string, `first_occ` and `last_occ` will be the same, and the program will not remove both occurrences correctly.

### Case Analysis:

Let's consider some test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `func_1("hello", "l")`
   - Expected Output: `"heo"`
   - Actual Output: `"heo"` (This works correctly.)

2. **Test Case 2**: `func_1("hello", "o")`
   - Expected Output: `"hell"`
   - Actual Output: `"hell"` (This works correctly.)

3. **Test Case 3**: `func_1("hello", "h")`
   - Expected Output: `"ello"`
   - Actual Output: `"ello"` (This works correctly.)

4. **Test Case 4**: `func_1("hello", "l")`
   - Expected Output: `"heo"`
   - Actual Output: `"heo"` (This works correctly.)

5. **Test Case 5**: `func_1("hello", "e")`
   - Expected Output: `"hll"`
   - Actual Output: `"hll"` (This works correctly.)

6. **Test Case 6**: `func_1("a", "a")`
   - Expected Output: `""` (removes both occurrences)
   - Actual Output: `""` (This works correctly.)

7. **Test Case 7**: `func_1("abcde", "f")`
   - Expected Output: `"abcde"` (no occurrences)
   - Actual Output: `"abcde"` (This works correctly.)

8. **Test Case 8**: `func_1("l", "l")`
   - Expected Output: `""` (removes both occurrences)
   - Actual Output: `""` (This works correctly.)

### Conclusion:

After evaluating various test cases, the program fails to correctly handle cases where the character appears only once in the string. In such cases, it should return an empty string, but it currently does not handle that logic properly. 

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not remove the first and last occurrences correctly when the character appears only once in the string. For example, `func_1("a", "a")` should return `""`, but the code does not account for this situation correctly.
