To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the function `func_1` and check if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Finding Indices**:
   - `first_index = s.find(ch)` finds the first occurrence of the character `ch`.
   - `last_index = s.rfind(ch)` finds the last occurrence of the character `ch`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If either `first_index` or `last_index` is `-1`, or if they are equal (meaning there's only one occurrence of `ch`), the function returns the original string `s`.

3. **Removing Characters**:
   - The function constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The substring before the first occurrence of `ch`.
     - The substring between the first and last occurrences of `ch` (excluding both).
     - The substring after the last occurrence of `ch`.

### Test Cases Provided:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'`: Correct, removes the first and last 'l'.
- `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'`: Correct, removes the first and last 'a'.
- `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'`: Correct, removes the first and last 'P'.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider some additional edge cases:
1. **Single Character String**:
   - `func_1('a', 'a')` should return `''` (removes the only occurrence).
   
2. **Character Not Present**:
   - `func_1('hello', 'x')` should return `'hello'` (no removal happens).
   
3. **Character Occurs Only Once**:
   - `func_1('a', 'a')` should return `''` (removes the only occurrence).
   - `func_1('b', 'b')` should return `''` (removes the only occurrence).
   
4. **String with Multiple Same Characters**:
   - `func_1('aaaa', 'a')` should return `''` (removes the first 'a' at index 0 and the last 'a' at index 3, leaving nothing).

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle the case where the string consists of the same character (like 'aaaa') correctly. It should return an empty string when both the first and last occurrences are the same and there are no characters left in between.

Given that the program fails for the case `func_1('aaaa', 'a')`, we conclude that the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
