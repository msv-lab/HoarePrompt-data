To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` in the context of the problem description, which states that the function should divide two lists element-wise.

The program is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a list containing the element-wise division of the numbers in list1 by the corresponding numbers in list2
```

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Element-wise Division**: The function uses `zip(list1, list2)` to iterate over both lists simultaneously, which is correct for element-wise operations.

2. **Division Logic**: The expression `(a / b)` performs the division of elements from `list1` by corresponding elements from `list2`.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - **Division by Zero**: If any element in `list2` is zero, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a critical edge case that the function does not handle.
   - **Different Lengths**: If `list1` and `list2` are of different lengths, `zip` will only iterate up to the length of the shorter list. This means that elements in the longer list will be ignored, which may not be the intended behavior.

### Conclusion

Given these observations, the program does not handle the case where division by zero occurs, nor does it address the potential issue of unequal list lengths. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle division by zero, which can occur if any element in `list2` is zero, leading to a runtime error. Additionally, it does not address what should happen if the lists are of unequal lengths.
