The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a list containing the element-wise division of the numbers in `list1` by the corresponding numbers in `list2`. If any element in `list2` is zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will occur, which is not handled in the function. Therefore, the function may raise an error if `list2` contains any zeros.
