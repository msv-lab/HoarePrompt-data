Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, which must be of the same length. It raises a ValueError if the lengths are not equal. If they are equal, the function returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, this will raise a ZeroDivisionError during the division operation. **
