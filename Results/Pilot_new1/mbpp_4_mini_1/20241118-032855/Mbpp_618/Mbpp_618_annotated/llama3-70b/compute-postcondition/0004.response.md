The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and are of the same length. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that contains the result of element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers of the same length and return a list of numbers resulting from the element-wise division of the first list by the second list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, which are lists of numbers of the same length, and returns a list of numbers resulting from the element-wise division of list1 by list2.**
