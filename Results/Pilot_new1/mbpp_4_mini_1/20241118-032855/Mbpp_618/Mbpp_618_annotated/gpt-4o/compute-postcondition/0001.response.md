The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and are of the same length. Additionally, all elements in `list2` are non-zero. After executing the function body, it returns a list that contains the element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list that results from dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a list containing the element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`.**
