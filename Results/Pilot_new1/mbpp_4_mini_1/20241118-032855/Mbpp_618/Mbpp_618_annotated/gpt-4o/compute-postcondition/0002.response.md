Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a list containing the element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. However, if any element in `list2` is zero, this will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The function does not handle this case, so users should ensure that `list2` contains no zeros to avoid runtime errors. **
