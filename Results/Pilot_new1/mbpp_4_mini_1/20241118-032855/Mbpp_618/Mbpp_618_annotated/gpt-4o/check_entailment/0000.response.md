Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the function does not handle the case where any element in `list2` is zero, which would lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`. The annotations clearly state that the function "does not handle this case," indicating that if `list2` contains a zero, the program will crash instead of returning a valid output.

For example, if `list1 = [10, 20, 30]` and `list2 = [2, 0, 5]`, the program would attempt to perform the division `20 / 0`, resulting in a runtime error. This scenario contradicts the requirement for the function to safely perform element-wise division, as it does not account for the possibility of division by zero.

Thus, since there exists at least one input case where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
