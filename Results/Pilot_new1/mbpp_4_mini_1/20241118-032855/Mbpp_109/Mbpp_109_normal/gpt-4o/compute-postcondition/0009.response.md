The variable `integer_value` is assigned the value of `int(binary_str, 2)`, which converts the binary string `binary_str` into its decimal equivalent. The previous value of `integer_value` is not known, but it will now hold the decimal representation of `binary_str`. The other variables (`binary_str`, `num_rotations`, `count`, and `_`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is 1 if `integer_value` is odd; otherwise, `count` remains 0, `_` is 1, and `integer_value` is now the decimal equivalent of the original `binary_str`.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is 1 if `integer_value` is odd; otherwise, `count` remains 0, `_` is 1, and `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of the original `binary_str`**
