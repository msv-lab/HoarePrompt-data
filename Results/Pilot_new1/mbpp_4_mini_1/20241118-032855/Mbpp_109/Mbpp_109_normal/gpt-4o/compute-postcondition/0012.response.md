According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `num_rotations`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `num_rotations` is greater than 1. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2. The value of `num_rotations` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. 

State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of the original `binary_str`, `count` is 2, `_` is 2**
