Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of the original `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 2; if `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 1. The value of `_` is 1.***
