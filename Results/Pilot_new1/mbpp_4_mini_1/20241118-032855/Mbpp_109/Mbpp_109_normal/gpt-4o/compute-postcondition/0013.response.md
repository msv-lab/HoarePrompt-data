The last character of `binary_str` is moved to the front, and the rest of the string is shifted to the right. The previous values of `binary_str`, `num_rotations`, `integer_value`, `count`, and `_` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `binary_str` after the rotation, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `integer_value` is the decimal equivalent of the original `binary_str`, `count` is 2, `_` is 2**
