To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the requirements of the problem description and how the code implements those requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **String Duplication**: The program duplicates the string `s` to ensure it can handle rotations. This is done by multiplying `s` by `(n // len(s) + 1)`, which ensures that the string is long enough to cover `n` rotations.

2. **Counting Odd Values**: The program initializes a counter `count` to zero. It then iterates `n` times, creating a substring `temp` which represents the rotated version of `s` at each index `i`. 

3. **Counting '1's**: For each substring `temp`, it counts the number of '1's and checks if that count is odd (`temp.count('1') % 2`). If it is odd, it increments the `count`.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the count of odd values.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case with Empty String**: If the input string `s` is empty (`s = ""`), then the program will attempt to create substrings from an empty string. This will lead to an error when trying to access `s[i:i + len(s)]` since `len(s)` is zero, causing an index error.

- **Handling of `n`**: If `n` is less than or equal to zero, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `0`, which might not be the expected behavior depending on how the problem interprets rotations for non-positive integers.

- **General Case**: The method of counting '1's and checking for odd/even is correct, but it does not cover the cases mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Given the identified edge cases, particularly the empty string case and the handling of non-positive `n`, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
