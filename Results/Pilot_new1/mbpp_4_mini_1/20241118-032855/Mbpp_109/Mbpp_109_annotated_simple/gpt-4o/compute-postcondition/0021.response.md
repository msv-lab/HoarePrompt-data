Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `binary_str` consisting of '0's and '1's, and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times to the right and counts how many times the integer representation of the rotated string in base 2 is odd. The function returns this count, which can range from 0 to `num_rotations`, depending on the oddness of the integer value after each rotation. If `num_rotations` is 0, the original string is not changed and the count remains 0. **
