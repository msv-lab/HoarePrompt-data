The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is not specified, so the output state indicates that `count` has been updated. The other variable states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `binary_str` is the rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the parity of `integer_value`, `_` is 1, and `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2.
