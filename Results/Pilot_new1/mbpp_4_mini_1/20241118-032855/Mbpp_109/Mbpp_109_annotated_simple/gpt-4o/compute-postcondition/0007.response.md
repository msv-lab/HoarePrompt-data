According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `num_rotations`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `num_rotations` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, resulting in `_` becoming 1. The value of `num_rotations` does not need to change as it is already greater than 0.

State: **`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is updated to 1 if `integer_value` is odd; otherwise, `count` remains 0, `_` is 1**
