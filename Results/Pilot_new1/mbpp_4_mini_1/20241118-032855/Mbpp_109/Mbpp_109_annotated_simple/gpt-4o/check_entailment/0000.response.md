To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - `binary_str`: A binary string (e.g., "101").
   - `num_rotations`: An integer representing how many times to rotate the binary string to the right.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times.
   - After each rotation, it converts the rotated binary string to an integer and checks if it is odd.
   - It counts how many times the integer representation is odd.

3. **Rotation Technique**:
   - The rotation is implemented by taking the last character of the string and placing it at the front, followed by the rest of the string.

4. **Counting Odd Numbers**:
   - The program checks if the integer value of the rotated string is odd using the modulus operator (`% 2`).

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Zero Rotations**: If `num_rotations` is 0, the string remains unchanged, and `count` should be 0, which is handled correctly.
- **Single Character Strings**: If `binary_str` is "0" or "1", the output should be correct since "1" is odd and "0" is even.
- **Multiple Rotations**: If `num_rotations` exceeds the length of the string, it should still handle the rotations correctly since rotating a string of length `n` by `n` or more is equivalent to rotating it by `n % length`.
- **All Zeros**: For a string like "0000", the count should always be 0 since all rotations will yield an even integer.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Input: `func_1("101", 1)`**:
   - Rotation: "110" (which is 6, even) → Count: 0
2. **Input: `func_1("101", 2)`**:
   - Rotation: "011" (which is 3, odd) → Count: 1
3. **Input: `func_1("000", 3)`**:
   - All rotations yield "000" → Count: 0
4. **Input: `func_1("1", 5)`**:
   - All rotations yield "1" → Count: 5

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the number of odd integers obtained from the rotations of the binary string. It handles edge cases appropriately, including strings with all zeros, single character strings, and cases with zero rotations. 

Since no potential case has been found where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
