According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state indicates that `count` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect the ability of the loop to run. To ensure the loop executes, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0. Since the loop uses an underscore for the loop variable, we do not need to track its value. 

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
