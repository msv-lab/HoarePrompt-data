The last character of `binary_str` is moved to the front, and the rest of the string is shifted right by one position. The value of `binary_str` is updated accordingly, but the values of `num_rotations` and `count` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `binary_str` after the rotation.

Output State: **`binary_str` is the rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
