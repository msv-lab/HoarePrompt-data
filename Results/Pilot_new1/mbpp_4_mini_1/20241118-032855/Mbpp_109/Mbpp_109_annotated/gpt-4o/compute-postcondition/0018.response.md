Output State: **`count` is the number of odd integers obtained from the binary string after each rotation for a total of `num_rotations` times. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `binary_str` will be the final rotated string after all rotations. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0 while `binary_str` remains unchanged.**
