The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. It performs a series of rotations on the binary string, moving the last character to the front, for a total of `num_rotations` times. After each rotation, it converts the rotated binary string to its integer equivalent and checks if that integer is odd. It counts the number of times an odd integer is obtained during these rotations. 

If `num_rotations` is 0, the function does not perform any rotations, and the count remains 0. The function ultimately returns the count of odd integers obtained from the binary string after the specified rotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, performs rotations on the binary string, counts how many of the resulting integers are odd, and returns that count. If `num_rotations` is 0, it returns 0 without any rotations. **
