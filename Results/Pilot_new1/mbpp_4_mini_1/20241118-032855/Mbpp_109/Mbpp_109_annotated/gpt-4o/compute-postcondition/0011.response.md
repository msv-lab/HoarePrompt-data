Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `count` is initially 0. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 0. Thus, after execution, `count` will be either 0 or 1 depending on the parity of `integer_value`.***
