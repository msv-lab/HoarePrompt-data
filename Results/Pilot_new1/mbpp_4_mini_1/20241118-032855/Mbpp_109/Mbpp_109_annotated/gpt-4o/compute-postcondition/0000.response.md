The variable `count` is initialized to `0`. The initial states of `binary_str` and `num_rotations` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `binary_str` and `num_rotations`, while `count` is now set to `0`.

Output State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 0**
