The last character of `binary_str` is moved to the front, and the rest of the string is shifted to the right. Since `binary_str` is a rotated string and `num_rotations` is greater than 2, the exact value of `binary_str` is unknown, but its length is at least 3. The value of `count` remains unchanged at 1. Therefore, the output state is: `binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 2, `count` is 1, and `binary_str` has been modified to reflect the rotation.

Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 2, `count` is 1, and `binary_str` has been modified to reflect the rotation**
