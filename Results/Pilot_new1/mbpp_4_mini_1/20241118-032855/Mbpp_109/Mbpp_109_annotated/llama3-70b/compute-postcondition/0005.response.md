According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0, which means the loop can execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. The variable `temp` remains unchanged as it is just a reference to `s`, which is still valid.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `temp`. Since `temp` is `s`, it does not require any change.

State: **`s` is the binary string repeated enough times to ensure its length is at least `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1 depending on the count of '1's in `s`, `i` is 1, `temp` is `s`**
