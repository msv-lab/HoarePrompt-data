Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element and `elem` is equal to one of its elements, the loop will return True and the index of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `arr` is a list with at least one element and `elem` is not present, the loop will finish without returning, and the state remains unchanged. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and there is no return value, leaving the state unchanged.**
