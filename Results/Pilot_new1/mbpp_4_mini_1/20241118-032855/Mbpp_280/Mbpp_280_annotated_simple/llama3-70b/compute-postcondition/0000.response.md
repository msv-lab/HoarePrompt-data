According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the index of the last element in `arr`, and `x` will be that last element. For the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least 1 element, and initially, `i` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**
