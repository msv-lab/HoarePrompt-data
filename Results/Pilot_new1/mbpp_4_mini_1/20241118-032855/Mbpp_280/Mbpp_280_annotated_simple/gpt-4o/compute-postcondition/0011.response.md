Output State: **If `arr` is a list with at least one element, the loop will check each element against `element`. If a match is found, the function returns `True` and the index of the matching element. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function does not return any value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no values are returned. In such a case, `index` is not defined, and `value` is not defined.**
