The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list of elements, which can be of any type, and `element` can also be of any type. 

- Case_1: If `arr` is a list with at least one element and if any element in `arr` is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `arr` is empty, the function does not return any value. If no elements in `arr` are equal to `element`, the function does not return any value either.

- Case_2: If the conditions of Case_1 are not met, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and return `True` with the index of `element` if found in `arr`. If `arr` is empty or `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an `element`, returns `True` with the index of `element` if found in `arr`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.**
