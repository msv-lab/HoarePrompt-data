To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code itself.

**Problem description:** The function should take an array and an element, returning a tuple that indicates whether the element is in the array and the index of the element (or -1 if not found).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr, elem):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == elem:
            return (True, i)
    return (False, -1)
```

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The code uses a loop to iterate through the array `arr` using `enumerate`, which gives both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element.
2. If it finds an element `x` that matches `elem`, it returns a tuple `(True, i)`, indicating that the element exists in the array and providing its index.
3. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`, indicating that the element is not in the array.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
1. **Empty Array:** If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `(False, -1)`, which is correct.
2. **Element Not in Array:** If `elem` is not found, the function correctly returns `(False, -1)`.
3. **Element at Different Positions:** The function will return the index of the first occurrence of `elem`, which is correct as per the description.

**Output Hints:**
- The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `elem` if found; otherwise, it returns `False` and -1. It also states that if `arr` is empty, it directly returns `False` and -1 without executing the loop.

**Conclusion:**
The function correctly implements the requirements as specified in the problem description. It handles all the edge cases properly, including when the array is empty, when the element is not found, and it correctly returns the index of the first occurrence of the element.

Since the code meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem statement and the output hints align with the code's behavior, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
