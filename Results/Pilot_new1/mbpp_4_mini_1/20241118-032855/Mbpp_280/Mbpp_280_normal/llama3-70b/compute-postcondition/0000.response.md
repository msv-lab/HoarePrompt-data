According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the beginning of the loop, the index `i` should start at 0, and `x` should be the first element of the list `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and the initial values should be `i` is 0 and `x` is the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list `arr`**
