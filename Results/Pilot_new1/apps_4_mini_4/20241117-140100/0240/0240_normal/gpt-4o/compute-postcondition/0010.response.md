The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all the characters in the string `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, the resulting value of `candidate` will be that specific permutation. The values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
