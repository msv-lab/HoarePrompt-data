According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character (digit). Given that `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, if `s` is empty, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `c` will represent the current character being iterated over, which will be the first character of `s` in the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
