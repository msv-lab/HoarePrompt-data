Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. The loop will yield `candidate` if it is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` function. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only digits but does not generate any valid permutations according to `is_valid_number`, then no candidates are yielded despite the loop executing.**
