Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the criteria defined in the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, it does not yield any value.***
