The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means that `candidate` is formed by joining the elements of the iterable `perm` into a single string. The initial state specifies that `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, but the exact value of `chars` or `perm` is not given. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string representation of `perm`. The other variable `chars` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
