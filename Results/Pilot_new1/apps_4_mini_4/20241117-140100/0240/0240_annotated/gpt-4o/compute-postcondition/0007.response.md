The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator function and does not change the state of the variables in the surrounding context. Here, `candidate` is yielded, which is the string formed by joining `perm`. The values of `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged after the yield. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**.
