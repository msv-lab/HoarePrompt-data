The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty string `t` also containing digits. It constructs a new string `n` by concatenating characters from `s` that are present in `t`, followed by appending the entire string `t`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`. If `s` is empty or contains no characters found in `t`, the resulting string will consist solely of `t`, which will be converted to an integer.
