According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, and `c` is the next character in `s` that will be processed in the next iteration.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the following:

1. The character `c` needs to be updated to the next character in `s`. If `s` has more characters remaining after the current `c`, `c` will be the next character in the string.
2. The string `s` will still be non-empty as long as there are more characters left to iterate over.

Thus, we need to ensure that `s` has at least one more character after the current character `c`. 

If `c` is the last character in `s`, the loop will not execute again, so we need to adjust `s` to reflect that it still has characters remaining.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least one more character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is either the first character of `s` or the first character of `s` concatenated with the next character in `s`, `c` is the next character in `s`**
