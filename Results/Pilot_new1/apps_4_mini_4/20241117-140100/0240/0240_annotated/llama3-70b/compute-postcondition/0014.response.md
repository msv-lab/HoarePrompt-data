The value of `n` is updated by concatenating `t` to its current value. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a string based on the characters from `s` that are in `t_set`, we need to consider that `n` could be an empty string or a string containing certain characters based on `s` and `t_set`. The value of `t` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact impact on `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current understanding of `n` and the addition of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing characters from `s` that are in `t_set`, and `n` is updated by concatenating `t` to it.**
