To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

The problem requires rounding a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends in 0. The rounding rules state:

- If the last digit (remainder when divided by 10) is less than or equal to 5, round down to the nearest lower multiple of 10.
- If the last digit is greater than 5, round up to the nearest higher multiple of 10.

Now, let's break down the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    remainder = n % 10
    if (remainder <= 5) :
        result = n - remainder
    else :
        result = n + (10 - remainder)
    print(result)
```

### Annotations Analysis:
The annotations provided state that:
- If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is set to `n - remainder`.
- If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is set to `n + (10 - remainder)`.

This correctly describes the logic implemented in the code.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case when n = 0**: 
   - Input: `0`
   - Remainder: `0 % 10 = 0` (which is ≤ 5)
   - Result: `0 - 0 = 0` (correct)

2. **Case when n = 5**:
   - Input: `5`
   - Remainder: `5 % 10 = 5` (which is ≤ 5)
   - Result: `5 - 5 = 0` (correct)

3. **Case when n = 6**:
   - Input: `6`
   - Remainder: `6 % 10 = 6` (which is > 5)
   - Result: `6 + (10 - 6) = 10` (correct)

4. **Case when n = 11**:
   - Input: `11`
   - Remainder: `11 % 10 = 1` (which is ≤ 5)
   - Result: `11 - 1 = 10` (correct)

5. **Case when n = 15**:
   - Input: `15`
   - Remainder: `15 % 10 = 5` (which is ≤ 5)
   - Result: `15 - 5 = 10` (correct)

6. **Case when n = 16**:
   - Input: `16`
   - Remainder: `16 % 10 = 6` (which is > 5)
   - Result: `16 + (10 - 6) = 20` (correct)

7. **Case when n = 1000000000**:
   - Input: `1000000000`
   - Remainder: `1000000000 % 10 = 0` (which is ≤ 5)
   - Result: `1000000000 - 0 = 1000000000` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the rounding logic as required by the problem description. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the specified rules for rounding. Since I could not find any case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
