The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is greater than 5, the value of `10 - remainder` will be a positive integer less than 5. Therefore, `result` will be greater than `n` by a value between 1 and 4. The states of `n` and `remainder` are not changed by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n` (0 to 9) and greater than 5; `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
