The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and is within the range of 0 to 10^9, the output state will reflect that `n` is now an input integer. The previous state of `n` is not specified, so it will be considered as an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
