The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. Given that `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, we can deduce that `n % 10` will be a value between 1 and 5. Thus, `n - n % 10` will result in `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10.

Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, the output will be the nearest lower multiple of 10. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the result of the operation `print(n - n % 10)` will be `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the result is `n - n % 10`**
