The code prints the value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer that satisfies the conditions 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and is divisible by 10, it will output the value of `n` directly. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is simply the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10, and the function prints `n`**.
