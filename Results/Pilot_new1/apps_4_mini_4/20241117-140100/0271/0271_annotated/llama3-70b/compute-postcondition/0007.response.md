The value of `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and `n % 10 > 5`. This means that `n` can be represented as `n = 10k + r`, where `k` is an integer and `r` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, which satisfies 6 ≤ r ≤ 9. 

The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`. Since `n % 10` is greater than 5, `10 - n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 4. Thus, the output of the print statement will be `n` plus a small integer (1 to 4).

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n % 10 > 5`, and the printed value is the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n % 10 > 5, and the printed value is the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.**
