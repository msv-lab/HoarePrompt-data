Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is between 0 and 5 (inclusive), then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is between 6 and 9 (inclusive), then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`, which results in `result` being either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.***
