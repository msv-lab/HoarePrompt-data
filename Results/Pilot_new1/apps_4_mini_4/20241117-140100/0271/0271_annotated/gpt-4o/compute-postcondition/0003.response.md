The value of `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. The previous values of `n` (a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9) and `remainder` (an integer between 0 and 5) will determine the final value of `result`. Therefore, `result` will also be a non-negative integer since subtracting a number between 0 and 5 from a non-negative integer will not yield a negative result.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 5, and `result` is `n - remainder`**
