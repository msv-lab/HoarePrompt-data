Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`, which can result in values from `n + 1` to `n + 4`.***
