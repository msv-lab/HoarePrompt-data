The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The output behavior of the function is not explicitly provided in the task. However, based on the parameter constraints, we know that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). Without specific output details, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. The return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
