Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` from the user, calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10, and rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 (i.e., `n - remainder`). If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10 (i.e., `n + (10 - remainder)`). The result is then printed.**
