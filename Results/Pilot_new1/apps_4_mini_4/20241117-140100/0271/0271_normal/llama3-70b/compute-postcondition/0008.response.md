Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is not divisible by 10. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`. If the remainder of `n` is greater than 5, the output is `n` rounded up to the next multiple of 10.***
