Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input `s` and checks if it is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backwards. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function handles empty strings and single-character strings as palindromes, but it does not return any value. **
