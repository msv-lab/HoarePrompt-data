The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous states of the other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
