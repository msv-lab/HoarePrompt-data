Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the program continues without altering `is_palindrome`.***
