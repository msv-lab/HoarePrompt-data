The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function, which assigns the length to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` will take a value between 1 and 1000 based on the actual length of `s`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`**
