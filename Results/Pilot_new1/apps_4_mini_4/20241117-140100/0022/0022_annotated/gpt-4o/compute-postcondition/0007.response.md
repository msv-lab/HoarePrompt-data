Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 2 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters are equal, the function does not return anything, thus not explicitly providing a return value.***
