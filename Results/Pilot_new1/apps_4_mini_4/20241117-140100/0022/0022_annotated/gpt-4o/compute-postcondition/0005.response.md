According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2, which means `n // 2` is at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already at least 2, allowing the loop to continue executing.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 2 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
