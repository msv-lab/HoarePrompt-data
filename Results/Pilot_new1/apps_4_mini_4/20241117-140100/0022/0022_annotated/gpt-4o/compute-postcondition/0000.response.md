The value of `n` is assigned the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` will be an integer value that represents this length, which can range from 1 to 1000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000; `n` is the length of `s`**
