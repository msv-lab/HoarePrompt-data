Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if all corresponding characters in `s` match for indices `i` and `n - i - 1` for `i` in the range `0` to `n // 2 - 1`. If a mismatch occurs at any point, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop exits. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that a single character is trivially a palindrome. If `n` is 0 or negative, which is outside the defined constraints, the loop does not execute, and the initial state of `is_spalindrome` is not altered.**
