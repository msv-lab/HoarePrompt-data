Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input from the user, checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center, and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome or 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty, and it assumes that the input will always be a valid string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. **
