The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
