Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the function prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, the function prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, the function prints '0' if `z` is 0; otherwise, it prints '?'. If `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, the function prints '?'. All conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are preserved.***
