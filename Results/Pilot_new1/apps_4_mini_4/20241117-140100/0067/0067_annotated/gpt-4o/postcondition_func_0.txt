The function accepts three integer inputs `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent upvotes, downvotes, and additional votes respectively. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. The function then prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met, indicating that the outcome is uncertain. The function does not return any value.
