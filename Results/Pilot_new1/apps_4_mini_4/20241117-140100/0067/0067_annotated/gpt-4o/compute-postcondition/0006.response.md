The code `print('-')` outputs a string `'-'` to the console. It does not modify any of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `max_upvotes`, or `min_downvotes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables alongside the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integer values; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`; printed '-'**
