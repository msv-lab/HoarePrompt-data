The code executes a print statement that outputs a question mark `?`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `max_downvotes`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers; `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; printed `?`**
