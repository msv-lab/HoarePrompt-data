Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than `y`. If none of these conditions are met, it defaults to printing '?'. The function does not return any value. **
