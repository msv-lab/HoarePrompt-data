The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are reassigned values based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a string input, splits it into separate components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the specific input values are not provided, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` will now hold integer values based on the input, while the previous values are unknown.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values**
