The `print('?')` statement outputs the character `?` to the console. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of the variables, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and the output is '?'**
