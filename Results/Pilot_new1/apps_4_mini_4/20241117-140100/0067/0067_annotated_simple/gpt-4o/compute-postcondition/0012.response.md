Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the function prints '+'. Otherwise, the function prints '?'. This means that if the maximum number of downvotes is below the minimum number of upvotes, it indicates a positive outcome, whereas if it is not, the result is uncertain.***
