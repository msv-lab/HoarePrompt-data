The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified but are based on input values. Therefore, the output state includes the values of `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes`. The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` are derived from `x` and `z`, while `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
