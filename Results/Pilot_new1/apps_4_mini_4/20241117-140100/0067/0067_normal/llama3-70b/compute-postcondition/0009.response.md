The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '0'. The state of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remains unchanged as the print function does not modify their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `x` is equal to `y`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. Additionally, `z` is equal to 0, and '0' is printed.**
