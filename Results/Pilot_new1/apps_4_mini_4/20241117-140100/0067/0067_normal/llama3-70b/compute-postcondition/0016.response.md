Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen '-' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y`, '0' is printed if `z` is 0; otherwise, '?' is printed if `z` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than `y`, '?' is printed. Throughout all cases, the condition `x <= y + z` is maintained.***
