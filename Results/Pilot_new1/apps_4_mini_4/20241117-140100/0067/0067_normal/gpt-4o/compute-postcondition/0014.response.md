The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates on three integer variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with the integers `x`, `y`, and `z` under the given constraints, but the exact return value is not defined in the output provided.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on integers x, y, and z, constrained to the range 0 to 100, but the return value is not specified.**
