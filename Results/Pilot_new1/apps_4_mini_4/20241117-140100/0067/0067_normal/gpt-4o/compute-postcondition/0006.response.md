The `print('-')` statement outputs a string `'-'` to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as this statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is based on the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z < y`); and the output is '-'**
