The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are integers based on the input values. The state of `min_upvotes` remains equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` remains equal to `x + z`. The output state reflects the new assignment of `min_downvotes` while retaining the existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
