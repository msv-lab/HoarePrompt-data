Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, the loop is exited; otherwise, the loop continues without any changes to `found`, `color_counts`, or `window_counts`.***
