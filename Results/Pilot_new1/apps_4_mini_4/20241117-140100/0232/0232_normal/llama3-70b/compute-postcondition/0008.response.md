The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not already a key in `color_counts`, it would have been initialized to 0, and thus after the increment, it would become 1. If `color` was already present as a key, its previous value would increase by 1. Therefore, the output state depends on whether `color` was previously in `color_counts` or not.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `color` is the first element in `colors`, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
