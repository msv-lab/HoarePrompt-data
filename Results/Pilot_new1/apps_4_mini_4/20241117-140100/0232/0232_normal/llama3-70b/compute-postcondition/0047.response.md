Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]` with `window_counts[color]` incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop; otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
