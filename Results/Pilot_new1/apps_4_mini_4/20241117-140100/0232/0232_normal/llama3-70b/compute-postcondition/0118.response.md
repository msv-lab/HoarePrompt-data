Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, the loop breaks, and `found` remains True. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, `found` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` is still empty. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and all variables remain unchanged. Thus, after execution, if `found` is True, it indicates a matching color count was found; otherwise, all variables retain their previous values.***
