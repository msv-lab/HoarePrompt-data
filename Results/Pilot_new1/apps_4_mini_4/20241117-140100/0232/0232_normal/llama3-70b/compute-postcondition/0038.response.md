The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
