Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
