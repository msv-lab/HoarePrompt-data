Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, the loop is exited, and `i` and `j` may have any values depending on the loop execution, while `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` contains the updated count for `color`. If `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is 0, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, indicating that the loop did not execute.***
