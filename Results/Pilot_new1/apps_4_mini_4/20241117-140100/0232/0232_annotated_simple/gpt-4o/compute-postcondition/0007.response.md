Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `k` is a list of `m` integers, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m`, and `current_counts` is updated for `colors[right]`. If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If the counts do not match, the function does not return anything.***
