Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `k` is a list of `m` integers, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m`, `current_counts` is updated for `colors[right]`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0. For every color in `desired_counts`, the count in `current_counts` matches the corresponding count in `desired_counts`.***
