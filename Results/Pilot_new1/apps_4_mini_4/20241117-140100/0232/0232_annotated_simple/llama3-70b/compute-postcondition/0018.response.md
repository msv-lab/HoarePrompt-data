Output State: **`color_counts` contains the count of each unique color from the `colors` list. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `colors` contains at least one color, `color_counts` will have keys corresponding to the unique colors and values representing the number of times each color appears in the `colors` list.**
