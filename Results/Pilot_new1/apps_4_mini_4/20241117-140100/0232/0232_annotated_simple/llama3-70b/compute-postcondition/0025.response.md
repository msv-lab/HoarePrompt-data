The statement `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. Since `color` is not present in `window_counts`, this effectively adds the key `color` with a value of `0`. The other variables, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` now contains the key `color` with a value of 0, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` now contains the key `color` with a value of 0, `j` is 0**
