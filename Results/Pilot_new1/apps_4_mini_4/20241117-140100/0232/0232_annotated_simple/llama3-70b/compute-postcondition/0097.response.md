Postcondition: ***`window_counts` includes the key `color` with its value updated, `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, and `color` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains as initially described in the precondition, with no changes to `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, or `color`.***
