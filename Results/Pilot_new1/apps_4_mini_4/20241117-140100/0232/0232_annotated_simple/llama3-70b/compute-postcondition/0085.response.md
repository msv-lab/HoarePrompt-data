Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to `n-1`. If `found` is True, the loop breaks without modifying `i`, `n`, or `j`, indicating that the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`. If `n` is equal to or less than `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, with `i`, `n`, and `j` unchanged. Additionally, if `colors` contains fewer than `n` elements or if the indices are out of bounds, these cases are appropriately handled to prevent errors, ensuring that the integrity of the variables is maintained.***
