The statement assigns the value `0` to `window_counts[color]`. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` is not specified, but it is updated to `0`. The other variables (`color_counts`, `j`, `n`, and `color`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` has the key `color` updated to `0`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`.

Output State: **`window_counts` has the key `color` updated to `0`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`**
