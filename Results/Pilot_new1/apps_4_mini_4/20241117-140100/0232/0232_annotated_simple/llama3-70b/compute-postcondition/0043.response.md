Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
