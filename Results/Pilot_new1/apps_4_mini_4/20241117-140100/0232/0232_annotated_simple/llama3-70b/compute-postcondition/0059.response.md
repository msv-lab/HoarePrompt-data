Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. `color_counts` remains unchanged, and the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` are 1, greater than 1, and 1 respectively, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` is already a key in `window_counts`, no changes are made to the dictionary.***
