The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as `color_counts` is unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
