According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i`, which is already satisfied in the given state (`n` is greater than `i`). The loop will start with `j` initialized to `i`. Since `window_counts` is an empty dictionary and `found` is False, these states do not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state to ensure the loop can execute are that `j` should be initialized to `i`. 

State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is `i`**
