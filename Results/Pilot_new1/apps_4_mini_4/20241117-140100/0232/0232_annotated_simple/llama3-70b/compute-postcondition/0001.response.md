The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `input` values to integers. The `input` function accepts a space-separated string of integers, which are then converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `counts` are not affected by this operation, but the content of `colors` will now hold the integers provided via input. 

Since the specific input is not provided, we denote that `colors` will now contain a list of integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers based on input, `counts` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(counts) ≤ n**
