Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is less than or equal to `n`, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding elements in `k`. If the current counts of colors match the desired counts for all colors in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If the current counts do not match the desired counts, the function does not return any value.***
