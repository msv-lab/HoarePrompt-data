The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers where the sum of the elements in k is less than or equal to n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to the corresponding elements in k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int), and `left` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers where the sum of the elements in k is less than or equal to n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to the corresponding elements in k, `current_counts` is a defaultdict(int), and `left` is 0.**
