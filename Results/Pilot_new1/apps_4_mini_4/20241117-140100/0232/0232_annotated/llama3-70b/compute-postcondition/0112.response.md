The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is updated with `color` incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `n` is greater than `i + 1`; `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
