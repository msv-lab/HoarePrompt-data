Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing counts of colors from `colors`. If `found` is True, the loop breaks, indicating that the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the loop executes 0 times (when `n` is not greater than `i + 1`), `window_counts` remains empty, and `found` remains True. If `n` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop executes at least once, updating `window_counts` with at least one color from `colors`, and the value of `found` will depend on whether the counts match the targets in `counts`.***
