The variable `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This does not affect the previous values of the other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, and `n`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables along with the new state of `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is {}**
