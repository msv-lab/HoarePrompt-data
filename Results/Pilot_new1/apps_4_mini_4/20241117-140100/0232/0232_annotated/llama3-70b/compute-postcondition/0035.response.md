Postcondition: ***`color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is set to True or False based on the match of `window_counts` and `counts`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is now added with a value of 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
