Postcondition: ***`color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, and `window_counts[color]` has been increased by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the specified `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop, indicating a successful match of color counts. If there is no match, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without interruption.***
