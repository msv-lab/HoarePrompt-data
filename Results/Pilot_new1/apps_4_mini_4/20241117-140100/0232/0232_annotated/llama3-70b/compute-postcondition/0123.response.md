Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, followed by a list of `n` colors and a list of `m` target counts. It then checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of colors such that the frequency of each color in that subarray matches the corresponding target count. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value directly. **
