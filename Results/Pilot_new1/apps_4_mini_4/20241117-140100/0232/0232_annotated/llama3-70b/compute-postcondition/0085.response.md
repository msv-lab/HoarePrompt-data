Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[j-1]`, `found` is True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `found` is False, the loop continues to execute, and `window_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` ranges from `i` to `n-1`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` empty and `found` as False.***
