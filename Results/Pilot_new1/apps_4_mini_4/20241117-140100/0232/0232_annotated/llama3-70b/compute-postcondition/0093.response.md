Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `color`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of `0` and then incremented by 1; if `color` is already present, its value is incremented by 1. The variable `found` remains True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1` with `color` assigned the value of `colors[j]`.**
