The function `func` does not accept any parameters. After executing the function body, it operates with three integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are constrained such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified.**
