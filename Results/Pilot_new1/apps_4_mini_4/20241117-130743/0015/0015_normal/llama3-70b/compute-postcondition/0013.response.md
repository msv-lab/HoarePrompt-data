Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, which includes cases where `(b - a)` is zero, and 'NO' otherwise, covering scenarios where `(b - a)` is negative and not divisible by `c` or positive and not divisible by `c.***
