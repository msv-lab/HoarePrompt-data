The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and non-negative; 'YES' is printed.**
