To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

The problem requires us to check if a favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The difference between neighboring elements `c`

The elements of the sequence can be represented as:
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for `i = 1, 2, 3, ...`

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The input is correctly read as three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking if `b` equals `a`**: 
   - If `b == a`, the code correctly prints "YES".

3. **Handling the case when `c == 0`**:
   - If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, the sequence will only consist of the single element `a`. Thus, it correctly prints "NO".

4. **Handling when `c != 0`**:
   - The code checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (this checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by stepping by `c`).
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` (this ensures that the index `i` is positive).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **When `c > 0`**:
   - If `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = 3`, the sequence will be `1, 4, 7, ...` and it correctly outputs "YES".
   - If `a = 1`, `b = 6`, and `c = 3`, the sequence will be `1, 4, 7, ...` and it correctly outputs "NO".

2. **When `c < 0`**:
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 7`, and `c = -3`, the sequence will be `10, 7, 4, ...` and it correctly outputs "YES".
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 8`, and `c = -3`, the sequence will be `10, 7, 4, ...` and it correctly outputs "NO".

3. **When `c = 0`**:
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 0`, it correctly outputs "YES".
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = 0`, it correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion
The program handles all the edge cases and potential scenarios outlined in the problem description correctly. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, handles the case when `c` is zero, and checks the conditions for when `c` is positive or negative. 

Since there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
