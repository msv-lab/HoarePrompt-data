The code prints 'NO', and the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Since `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the output state reflects that the print statement has been executed. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9; `c` is equal to 0; `a` is not equal to `b`, and 'NO' has been printed.**
