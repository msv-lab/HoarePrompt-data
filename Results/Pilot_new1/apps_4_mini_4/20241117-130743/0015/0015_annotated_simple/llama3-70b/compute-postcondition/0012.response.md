Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is zero (which is divisible by any non-zero `c`), as well as scenarios where `(b - a)` is negative or positive, affecting the output accordingly.***
