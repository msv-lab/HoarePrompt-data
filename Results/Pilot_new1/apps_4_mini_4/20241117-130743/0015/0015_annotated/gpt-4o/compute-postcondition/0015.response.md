Functionality: ** The function reads three integers from input, named `a`, `b`, and `c`. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is zero, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not zero, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
