Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and (b - a) / c is non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers all cases where `c` can be zero or non-zero, and includes the conditions for divisibility and non-negativity.***
