The code assigns values to `a`, `b`, and `c` based on the input split into integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, so they are replaced with the new values obtained from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned new integer values based on user input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input**
