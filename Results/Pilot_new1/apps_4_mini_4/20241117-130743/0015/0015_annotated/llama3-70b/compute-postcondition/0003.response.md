The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print function does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is 0, and `a` is equal to the value of `b`.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is 0, and `a` is equal to the value of `b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
