To determine if the `while` loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions specified in the loop: `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`.

- The variable `i` is currently 1, which means for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. Since `s` is a string with a length between 1 and 100,000, `len(s)` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` being 1 suggests that it can execute again as long as `len(s)` is greater than 1.

- The variable `j` is either 0 or 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must also be less than `target_len`, which is 26. Since `j` is either 0 or 1, it satisfies this condition, meaning the loop can execute again regardless of the current value of `j`.

Given that both conditions for the loop are satisfied with the current state, there is no need to adjust any variables to allow for one more iteration.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 0 or 1**
