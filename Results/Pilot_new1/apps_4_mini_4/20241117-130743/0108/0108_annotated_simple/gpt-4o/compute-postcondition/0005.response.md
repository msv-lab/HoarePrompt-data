The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is 0, so after execution, `j` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `target`.
