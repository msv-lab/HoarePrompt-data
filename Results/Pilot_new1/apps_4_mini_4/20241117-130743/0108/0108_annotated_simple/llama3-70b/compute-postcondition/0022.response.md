The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that follows it in the alphabet. Since `res` is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in alphabetical order up to the first character not found in `s`, and now includes 'c', the execution of this line will modify `s` by replacing `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. 

The specific impact on `res` depends on the value of `char` and the contents of `s`. However, since we don't have the specific values of `s` or `char`, we can only state that `s` will be modified, and `res` will potentially change based on this modification.

Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in the order of the alphabet until the first character not found in `s`, and now includes 'c'; `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet.**
