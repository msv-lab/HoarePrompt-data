The variable `res` is assigned the value `res + char`. The initial value of `res` is 'abcd', and `char` is one of 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will be 'abcda', 'abcdb', 'abcdc', or 'abcdd', depending on the value of `char`. The state of `s` and `char` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` contains characters from 'a' to 'd', `res` is either 'abcda', 'abcdb', 'abcdc', or 'abcdd', and `char` is one of 'a', 'b', 'c', or 'd'**
