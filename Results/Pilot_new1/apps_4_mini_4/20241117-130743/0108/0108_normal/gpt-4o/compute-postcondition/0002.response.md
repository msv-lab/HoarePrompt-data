The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, where `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The length of this string is 26. The initial state of the other variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26.
