The code snippet `print(target)` outputs the value of `target`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `target`. The variables `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged, but since `target` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its value.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `j` is equal to `target_len`, `i` is the length of `s`, and the function prints `target`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is equal to `target_len`, `i` is the length of `s`, and the function prints `target`, which is undefined.**
