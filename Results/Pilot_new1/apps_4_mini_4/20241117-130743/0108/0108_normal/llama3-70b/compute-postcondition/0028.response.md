According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` remains unchanged and `s` remains the same, which means that the state of `char` is crucial. Since `char` is not mentioned in the previous state, we cannot determine if it is still in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be in `s`. 

So, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` is present in `s`.

State: **`res` remains unchanged, `s` remains the same, and `char` is in `s`**
