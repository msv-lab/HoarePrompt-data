The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the ASCII table. The initial values are `s` contains 'a', `char` is 'b', and `res` is updated by appending 'b'.

Since `char` is 'b', the code will attempt to replace 'b' in `s` with 'c' (which is `chr(ord('b') + 1)`). However, since 'b' is not present in `s` (which only contains 'a'), the string `s` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
`s` contains 'a'; `char` is 'b'; `res` is updated by appending 'b' (remains unchanged).

Output State: **`s` contains 'a'; `char` is 'b'; `res` is updated by appending 'b'**
