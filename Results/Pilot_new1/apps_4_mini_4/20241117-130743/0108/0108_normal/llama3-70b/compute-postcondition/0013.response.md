Output State: **`if s contains any 'a' then res is a string consisting of all 'a's in s, followed by 'b's if any are present, then 'c's, and so on, until the first character not present in s is reached, at which point the loop stops. The final value of s will have the first occurrence of each character from 'a' to the last character found replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and char will be the first character not present in s. If s does not contain 'a', the loop does not execute and res remains an empty string, with s unchanged.`**
