Output State: **If `s` contains any characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` will be a string consisting of all occurrences of each character in `s`, in the order of the alphabet, with each character replaced by the next character in the alphabet in `s`. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string while `s` remains unchanged. In the case where `s` contains characters beyond 'z', the loop will still execute only for the characters 'a' to 'z', and any characters in `s` that are not in this range will remain unchanged.**
