The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that is the next in the ASCII sequence (i.e., `ord(char) + 1`). Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, the first occurrence will be replaced. The variable `res` is not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `s` after the replacement, while `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next ASCII character, `res` is unchanged**
