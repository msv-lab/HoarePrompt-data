The code updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after it in the ASCII table. The value of `s` will change based on the specific value of `char`. The previous state of `res` is not affected, but it is mentioned that `res` is updated by appending `char`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `s` while noting that `res` has been updated.

Output State: **`s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in ASCII, and `res` is updated by appending `char`**
