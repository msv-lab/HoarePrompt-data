Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If it does, the function prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value and will raise a NameError if the string `s` contains all letters in order due to an undefined variable `target`. If `s` is empty, it will also print -1. **
