The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`; `j` is increased by 1. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`; `j` is increased by 1**
