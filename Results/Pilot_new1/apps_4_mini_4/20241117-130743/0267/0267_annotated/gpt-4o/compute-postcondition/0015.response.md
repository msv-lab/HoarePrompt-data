Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true. The result is returned modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0, and if no integers in the specified range satisfy the condition, it also returns 0. **
