According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, this condition is inherently satisfied. 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take on the value of `l`, which is the first value in the range. The loop will iterate from `l` to `r`, inclusive. 

Since `total_sum` is initialized to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Thus, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are as follows:
- `num` should be initialized to `l` (the starting point of the loop).

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
