According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be less than or equal to `r`, which means the next value of `num` would be `r + 1`. However, since `r` is defined such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `num` cannot exceed `r`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

As a result, there are no adjustments necessary for the state since the loop cannot run again.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0 initially**
