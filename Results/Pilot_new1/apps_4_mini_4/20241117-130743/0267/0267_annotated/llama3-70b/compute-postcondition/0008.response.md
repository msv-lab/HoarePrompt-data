Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, and `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`. If `k` is greater than 0, the pair (n, k) does not exist in the data structure `dp` or the function continues execution without returning a value.***
