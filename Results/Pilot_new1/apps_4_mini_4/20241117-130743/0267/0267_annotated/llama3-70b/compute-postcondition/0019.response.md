The statement `dp[n, k] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[n, k]` by taking its current value and applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. This means the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be the remainder when the current value is divided by `MOD`. 

If `k` is at least 2, `dp[n, k]` has been previously updated based on a certain formula, and now it will be modified by the modulus operation. If `k` is 1, the problem states that `dp[n, k]` remains 9, but since the modulus operation is applied, it will still be 9 if `MOD` is greater than 9.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[n, k]` after the modulus operation, while the previous values of `dp[n, k]` before the operation are not specified. Therefore, the output state will indicate the conditions and the result of the modulus operation.

Output State: **If k is at least 2, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] % MOD`; if k is 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9.**
