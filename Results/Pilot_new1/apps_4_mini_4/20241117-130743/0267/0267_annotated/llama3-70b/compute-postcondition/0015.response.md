The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `i` is 2, we can calculate the expression step by step:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`, which is `10 ** (2 - 1) = 10 ** 1 = 10`.
2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`, which is `10 ** (k - 2)`. Since `k` is greater than 2, this value will be `10` raised to a positive power.
3. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)` again, which is still `10`.
4. Now, substitute these values into the expression: 

   `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`

5. This simplifies to:

   `dp[n, k] += 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`

The updated value of `dp[n, k]` will depend on the value of `k`, but the exact numeric result cannot be determined without knowing `k`. However, we know that the update will occur.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2**
