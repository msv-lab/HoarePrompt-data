The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). After executing the function body, it returns the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, calculated modulo `MOD`. If no such integers exist, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, along with an integer `k`, and return the sum of certain integers in that range based on a condition, or 0 if no integers meet the condition. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, calculated modulo `MOD`, or 0 if no such integers exist.**
