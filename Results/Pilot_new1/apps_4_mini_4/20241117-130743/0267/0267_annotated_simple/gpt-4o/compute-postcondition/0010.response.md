Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0 initially. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to (0 + (r + 1)) % MOD, where `num` is `r + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, then `total_sum` remains 0.***
