According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r`, which means it has just finished processing the last value in the range. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented to `r + 1`, which would be outside the current range.

Given that `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and since `num` is initialized to `l`, the loop will have iterated through all values from `l` to `r`. Since `total_sum` is 0 initially and can only be updated when `func_1(num, k)` returns true, there are no adjustments needed to `total_sum` for the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` must be `r + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `r + 1`**
