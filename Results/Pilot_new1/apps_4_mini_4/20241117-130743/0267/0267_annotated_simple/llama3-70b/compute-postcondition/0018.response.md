The code updates the value of `dp[n, k]` based on the condition of `k`. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9, and the values of `l`, `r`, and `n` do not change. If `k` is at least 2, the value of `dp[n, k]` is modified using the given formula. However, since the initial state specifies that `k` is 1, we will use that condition.

Since `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9, and `l`, `r`, and `n` are unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is 9, `l` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged**.
