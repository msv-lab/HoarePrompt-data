The function accepts two parameters, an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. If `n` has more unique digits than `k`, it returns False. The function does not impose any restrictions on the range of `n`, so it can accept any integer value, including negative numbers, which may affect the digit count if considered. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is negative explicitly; it will treat the negative sign as a non-digit character.
