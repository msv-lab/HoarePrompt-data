According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which is already guaranteed by the provided conditions (1 <= l <= r < 10^18). The loop will start with `num` equal to `l`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0. For the loop to execute, the initial values of `num`, `l`, and `r` need to be set accordingly. Since `num` starts at `l`, we can state that `num` is equal to `l` at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is `l`**
