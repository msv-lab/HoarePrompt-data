Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is 0, the function returns 0. If the pair `(n, k)` exists in the data structure `dp`, the function returns the value associated with that key. If `(n, k)` is not in `dp`, the function does not return any value.***
