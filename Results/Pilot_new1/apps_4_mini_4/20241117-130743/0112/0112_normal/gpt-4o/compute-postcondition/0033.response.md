Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, and checks if all the digits of `num` can be formed using the cubes represented by `cube_faces`. It returns `True` if all digits can be matched with unused cubes; otherwise, it returns `False`. If there are no digits to match (i.e., if `num` is empty), the function will still return `True` since there are no digits to check against the cubes. Additionally, if `n` (the number of cubes) is less than 1, the function does not attempt to match any digits and will return `True` as there are no digits to match. **
