The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and since `cubes` is a list of lists based on input, it remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `digits` is now an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists based on input; `digits` is an empty set**
