The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` has the second element set to True, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
