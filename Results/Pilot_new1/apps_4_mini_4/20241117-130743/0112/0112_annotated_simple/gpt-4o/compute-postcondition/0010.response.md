According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, which means the loop will be able to execute again as long as `n` is at least 2.

Since `n` is at least 1, it is possible for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `found` (if it was set to True). The state of `used_cubes` does not need to change unless it was already True, which would have no effect on the loop.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be incremented to 1.
- `found` should be set to the appropriate value based on the loop body logic, which cannot be determined from the provided information.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 1**
