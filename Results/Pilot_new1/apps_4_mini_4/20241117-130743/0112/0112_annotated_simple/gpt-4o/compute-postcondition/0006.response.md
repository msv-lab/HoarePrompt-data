The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has been marked as used. The initial state specifies that `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`, and since `i` is 0, this means that the first element of `used_cubes` is now `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]**
