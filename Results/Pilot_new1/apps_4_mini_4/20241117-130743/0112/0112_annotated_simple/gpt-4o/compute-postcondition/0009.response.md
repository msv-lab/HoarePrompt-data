Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is a boolean indicating whether a match was found, and `i` is an integer equal to 0. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True and `found` is set to True; otherwise, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. It is also possible that `used_cubes[i]` was already True before execution, in which case no changes occur.***
