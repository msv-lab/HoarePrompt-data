Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of n boolean elements indicating whether each cube has been used. If `found` is False after checking the cubes for a digit, the function returns False. If `found` is True, the state of `used_cubes` is updated to reflect which cube was used. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged with all elements set to False. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If a `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces`, `found` will also remain False, leading to the return of False. Thus, if no cubes match a digit, the function returns False.**
