According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` iterable. If there is at least one more digit in `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, and there is at least one more digit in `digits`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the state of `found` does not need to be adjusted, but it is important to note that the next digit will be processed.

Given that `n` is between 1 and 3 and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean elements, these states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, as they are not directly related to the iteration of `digits`.

Thus, the only necessary adjustment is to reflect that the loop will now process the next digit.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean elements, `found` is False, and there is at least one more digit in `digits` (the next digit in `digits` will be processed)**
