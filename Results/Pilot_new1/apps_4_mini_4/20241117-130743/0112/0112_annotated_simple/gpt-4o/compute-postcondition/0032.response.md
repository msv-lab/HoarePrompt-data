The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cube_faces` is a list containing `n` lists, where each inner list consists of 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. Each integer in `cube_faces` is in the range of 0 to 9. 

After executing the function body, the function has two possible outcomes based on the conditions checked:

Case 1: If the function cannot find a digit in any of the `cube_faces` for the given digits, it returns `False`. 

Case 2: If all digits can be matched with the faces of the cubes, the function returns `True`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, and determine if a specified number can be formed using the digits available on the cubes, returning `True` if it can and `False` if it cannot. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of cube faces `cube_faces`, returning `True` if the number can be formed using the cubes, and `False` if it cannot.**
