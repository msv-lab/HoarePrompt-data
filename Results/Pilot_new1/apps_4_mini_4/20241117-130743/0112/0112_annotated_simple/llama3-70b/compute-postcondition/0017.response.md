Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` cubes, each represented as a list of 6 integers (ranging from 0 to 9). It collects all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. The resulting integer is printed but not returned. If `cubes` is empty or contains only '0', the output will be 0. **
