The `remove` method is called on the set `digits` to remove the string '0'. Since '0' is included in the set `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The variable `n` and the structure of `cubes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `digits` after removing '0'.

Output State: **`digits` is a set without '0', `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least `n` lists**.
