The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each `digit` in the `cube` list. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the `cubes` list contains at least one list, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, the `digits` set will be updated with the string values of each element in `cube`. The previous state of `digits` is unknown, but it will now include the new string representations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 list; `cube` is the first list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of elements in `cube`.**
