The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. Instead, it operates on a predefined input structure, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of lists representing cubes. The integer `n` is constrained to the values 1, 2, or 3, and each cube is represented as a list of 6 integers where each integer is in the range of 0 to 9. 

Based on the output provided, it can be inferred that the function processes the cubes in some manner but does not return specific values or messages based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a predefined integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of cubes represented as lists of 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), but does not return any values directly.**
