The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))`. This means that the `digits` set is sorted in descending order, the elements are joined into a single string, and then converted to an integer. The value of `max_num` will depend on the contents of `digits`. If `digits` is empty, `max_num` will raise an error, but assuming `digits` contains valid string representations of integers, `max_num` will be the largest possible integer formed by those digits.

Therefore, the output state is determined by the contents of `digits`. If `digits` contains elements, `max_num` will be a valid integer. If `digits` is empty, the state will reflect that `max_num` cannot be computed.

Output State: **`max_num` is the largest integer formed by sorting `digits` in descending order, and `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3.**
