The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous state of the variables is not affected by this operation, and the values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `digits` as an empty set while retaining the previous values of `n` and `cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input; `digits` is an empty set**
