The code prints the value of `max_num`. If `digits` is a non-empty set, `max_num` would have been defined as the largest integer formed from `digits`. However, if `digits` is empty, `max_num` remains undefined. The state of `digits` is not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers; `max_num` is the largest integer formed from `digits` or remains undefined if `digits` is empty.**
