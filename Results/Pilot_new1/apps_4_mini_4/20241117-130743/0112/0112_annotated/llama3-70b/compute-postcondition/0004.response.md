The code updates the `digits` set by adding string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. The variable `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and since `cubes` contains at least one list, `cube` will hold the integers from that first list. The previous value of `digits` is an empty set. 

After executing the code, `digits` will contain the string representations of the integers in `cube`. The values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`**.
