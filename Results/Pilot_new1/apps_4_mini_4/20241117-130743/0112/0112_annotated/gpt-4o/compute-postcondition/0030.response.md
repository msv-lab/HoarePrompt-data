Output State: **If `digits` contains all digits that can be found in `cube_faces`, then `used_cubes` will have at least one True value for each digit found, corresponding to the `cube_faces` list that contains it. If any digit in `digits` cannot be matched with any available cube face, the function returns False immediately. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False. If `n` is greater than 3, this is an invalid state, and should be handled accordingly, but it does not affect the execution of the loop in this fragment. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False.**
