Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all initially set to False, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, `found` is a boolean variable, and `i` is 0. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If the conditions are not met, `used_cubes[i]` remains False, `found` remains False, and the program continues without any changes to these variables.***
