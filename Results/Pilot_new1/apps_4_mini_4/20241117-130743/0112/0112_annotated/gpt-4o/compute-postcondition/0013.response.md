The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with `used_cubes[i]` set to True, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
