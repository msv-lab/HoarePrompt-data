The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists (cubes), each containing 6 integers (0 to 9). It returns an integer `x` which represents the maximum number of consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the cubes. If none of the numbers can be formed, it returns 0; if only 1 can be formed, it returns 1; if 1 and 2 can be formed but not 3, it returns 2; and if 1, 2, and 3 can all be formed, it returns 3. The function does not explicitly check for cases where `n` is outside the range of 1 to 3 or where the cubes do not contain valid integers between 0 and 9.
