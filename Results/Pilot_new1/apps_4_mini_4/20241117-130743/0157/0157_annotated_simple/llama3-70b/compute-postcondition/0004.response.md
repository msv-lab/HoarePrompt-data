To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `c` is an input integer.
- `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The code snippet provided performs the following operation:

```
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

This expression can be simplified as follows:
- `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be factored to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

Since `min_lemon` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, its value will depend on those inputs.

Now, the output state will include the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the computed value of `min_lemon`, along with the result of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the result of the print statement is `min_lemon * 7`.**
