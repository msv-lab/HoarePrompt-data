To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
- `total_fruits` is then calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The `print(total_fruits)` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`, but does not change any variable states.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we will express the output state in terms of these variables.

The output state will reflect the calculations based on the initial definitions of the variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7, and the function prints total_fruits.**
