To determine the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the impact of the code snippet provided.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The variable `total_fruits` is calculated using the formula:
     ```
     total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
     ```
   - This simplifies to:
     ```
     total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
     ```

3. **Impact**:
   - The value of `total_fruits` depends directly on the value of `max_lemons`, which is determined by the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `max_lemons`) remain unchanged in their state.

4. **Output State**:
   - We summarize the state of the variables and the calculated value of `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of (a, b // 2, c // 4), and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**.
