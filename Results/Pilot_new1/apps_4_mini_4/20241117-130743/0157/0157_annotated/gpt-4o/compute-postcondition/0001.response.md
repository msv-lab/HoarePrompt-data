The variable `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, and `c` also remains unchanged as a positive integer. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` as an input integer, while `a` and `c` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
