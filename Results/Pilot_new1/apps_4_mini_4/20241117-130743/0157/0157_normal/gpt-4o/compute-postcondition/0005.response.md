To determine the output state, we first need to understand the initial values and how the code affects them.

1. `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means that `max_lemons` will take the smallest value among these three calculations.
2. `total_fruits` is then calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.
3. The `print(total_fruits)` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since the initial state contains input values, we denote them generically. The specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will determine what `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` will be, but they are not provided here.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and the function prints `total_fruits`.**
