Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made given that each lemon requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The total number of fruits produced is then calculated based on the maximum number of lemons, which is printed as output. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the input values are negative or non-integer, which could lead to runtime errors. **
