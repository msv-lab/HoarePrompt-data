According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and does not require any adjustment. The variable `t` and the list `buses` do not impact the execution of the loop itself, but they may be relevant within the loop body.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and since `buses` is an empty list, we can state that it remains unchanged during the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
