The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers. After executing the code, `buses` will contain one tuple with the values of `s` and `d`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), where s and d are input integers.**
