The variable `ans` is assigned the value of -1. The initial state of the other variables, `buses` and `min_time`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples (s, d) where each tuple consists of input integers s and d; `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples (s, d) where each tuple consists of input integers s and d; `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1**
