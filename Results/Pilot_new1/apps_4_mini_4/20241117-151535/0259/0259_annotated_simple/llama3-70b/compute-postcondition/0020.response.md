Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (s, d). If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the index of the bus that provides the minimum time. If `time` is equal to or greater than `min_time`, no changes are made to `min_time` or `ans`. In either case, `i` remains 0 as it refers to the first tuple in the `buses` list.***
