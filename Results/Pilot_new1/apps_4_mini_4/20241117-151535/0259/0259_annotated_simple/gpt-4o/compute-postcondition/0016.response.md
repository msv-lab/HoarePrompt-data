Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[0]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the selection of the current route. If `wait_time` is equal to or greater than `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. This ensures that the optimal route with the minimum wait time is chosen, covering all edge cases including when `s_i` is equal to `t`, when `wait_time` is zero, and when `wait_time` is at its minimum value.***
