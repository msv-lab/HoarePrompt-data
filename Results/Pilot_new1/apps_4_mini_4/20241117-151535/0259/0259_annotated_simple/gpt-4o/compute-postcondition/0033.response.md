Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`, indicating the time to wait until the bus arrives. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0, indicating the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This encompasses all cases, including when `t` coincides with the bus schedule or falls between two bus arrivals.***
