The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is taken from `bus_routes[i]`, and `t` is a positive integer. Since `s_i` can vary based on the specific bus route, the value of `wait_time` will depend on the particular values of `s_i` and `t`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `wait_time` based on these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` is the value from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
