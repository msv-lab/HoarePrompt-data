Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000). If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all `s_i` values are less than `t` and no bus can be caught without waiting, `min_wait_time` will be updated accordingly based on the calculated wait times. If all buses have the same wait time, `chosen_route` will be set to the first occurrence of that wait time.**
