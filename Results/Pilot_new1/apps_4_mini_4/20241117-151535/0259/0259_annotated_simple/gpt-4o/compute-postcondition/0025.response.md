The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied that `i` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, `chosen_route` will be one more than whatever the value of `i` is. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `min_wait_time`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.**
