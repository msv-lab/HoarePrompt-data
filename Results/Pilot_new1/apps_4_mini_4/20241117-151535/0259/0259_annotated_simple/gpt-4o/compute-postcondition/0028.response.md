The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but since the previous value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values assigned to `s_i` and `d_i`. However, we know that `i` is now one greater than its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented by 1**
