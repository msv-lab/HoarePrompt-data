The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which accepts two space-separated integers and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unaffected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables along with the newly assigned values of `s` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
