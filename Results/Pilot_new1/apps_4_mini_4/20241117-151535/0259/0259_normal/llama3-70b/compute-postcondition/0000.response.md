The values of `n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The specific values of `n` and `t` are not provided, but they remain positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000**
