The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the existing list `buses`. The variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation, and their values remain unchanged. The list `buses` will now include an additional tuple containing the values of `s` and `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `buses` is updated to include an additional tuple (s, d)**.
