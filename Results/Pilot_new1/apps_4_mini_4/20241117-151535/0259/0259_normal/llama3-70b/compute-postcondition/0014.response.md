The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `buses` (which is a list of tuples of integers) and `min_time` (which is `float('inf')`). The state of these variables does not change. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers (s, d), `min_time` is `float('inf')`, and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers (s, d), `min_time` is `float('inf')`, and `ans` is -1**
