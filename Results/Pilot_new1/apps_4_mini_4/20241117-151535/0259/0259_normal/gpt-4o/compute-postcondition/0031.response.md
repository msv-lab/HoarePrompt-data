The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are taken from `bus_routes[i]`, and `t` is not specified in the initial state but is assumed to be a defined variable. The calculation involves subtracting `(t - s_i) % d_i` from `d_i`. The specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided, but we know that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

Since the exact values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not known, we cannot compute a numerical value for `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationship and dependencies of the variables involved.

Output State: **`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
