The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, so we cannot specify the exact value of `chosen_route`. Other variables, including `min_wait_time`, remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
