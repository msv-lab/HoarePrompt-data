Postcondition: ***`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1`. If the time `t` minus `s_i` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative value representing the time until the next bus arrival.***
