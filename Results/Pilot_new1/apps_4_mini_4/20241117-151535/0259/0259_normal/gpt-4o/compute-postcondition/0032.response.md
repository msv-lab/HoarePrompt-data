Postcondition: ***`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If the time `t` minus `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating no wait is needed. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives, ensuring that `wait_time` is always a non-negative value.***
