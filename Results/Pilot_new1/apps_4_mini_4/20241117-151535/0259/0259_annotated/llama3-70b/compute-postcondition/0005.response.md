According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `_` has been incremented in the previous iteration. Since the loop is set to iterate `n` times, if the loop has executed for the last time, `_` must be equal to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain the same, but `_` must be adjusted to be equal to `n`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `_` should be equal to `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `t`, and `buses` do not change in the context of the loop execution. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is equal to `n`**
