The code snippet assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input and splitting it into two integers. The values of `s` and `d` are determined by the user's input, while the values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now assigned values based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is equal to `n`, `s` and `d` are input integers**
