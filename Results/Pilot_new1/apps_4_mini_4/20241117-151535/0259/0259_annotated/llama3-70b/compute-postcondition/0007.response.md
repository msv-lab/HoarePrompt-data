The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers, and since `buses` originally contains one tuple, it will now contain two tuples after the append operation. The other variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is equal to `n`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
