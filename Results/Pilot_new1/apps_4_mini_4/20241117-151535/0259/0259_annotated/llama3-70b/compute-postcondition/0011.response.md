According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `_` (which is equal to `n`) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has completed all of its iterations. For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be increased by 1, making it greater than `n`. Additionally, since `_` is equal to `n`, it should be adjusted to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 102, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains three tuples: the original two tuples and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is equal to n + 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
