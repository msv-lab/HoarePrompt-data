Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This accounts for all scenarios where the bus schedule is ahead of, exactly at, or behind the current time `t`, and ensures that the minimum wait time is correctly tracked.***
