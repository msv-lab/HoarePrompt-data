According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than `i + 1`, which implies that `i` is currently less than `n - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`. Since `n` remains unchanged, it still satisfies the condition that `n` is greater than `i + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not directly related to the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i + 1]`**
