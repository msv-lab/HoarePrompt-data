Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i < t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all scenarios including when the bus schedule is ahead of, exactly at, or behind the current time `t`.***
