Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the bus arrives exactly at time `t` (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This captures all scenarios based on the relationship between `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and the bus schedule.***
