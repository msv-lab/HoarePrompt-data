The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `wait_time` while maintaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is 0**
