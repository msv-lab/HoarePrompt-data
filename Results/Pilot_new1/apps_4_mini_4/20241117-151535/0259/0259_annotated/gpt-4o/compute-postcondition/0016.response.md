Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i` derived from `bus_routes[i]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is a non-negative value representing the time until the next bus. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, if the difference is not divisible, `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The conditions ensure that `min_wait_time` reflects the minimum wait time encountered, and `chosen_route` indicates the corresponding route.***
