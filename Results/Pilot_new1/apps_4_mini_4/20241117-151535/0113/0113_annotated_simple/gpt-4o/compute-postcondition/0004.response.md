Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `x`, which is computed as `n` multiplied by the integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. There are no checks for negative values of `n` or invalid values of `k`, which could lead to unexpected results if the function is used outside of the specified constraints. **
