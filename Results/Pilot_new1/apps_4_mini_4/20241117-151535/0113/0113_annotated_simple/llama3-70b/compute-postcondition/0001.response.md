The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8, the possible values for `x` will be powers of 10 ranging from \(10^0\) (which is 1) to \(10^8\) (which is 100,000,000). The values of `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer from 1 to 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 1 to 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer from 0 to 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
