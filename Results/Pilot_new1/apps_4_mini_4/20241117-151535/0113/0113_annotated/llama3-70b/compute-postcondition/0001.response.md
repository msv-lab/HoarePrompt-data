The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`, which means `x` will be `10` raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k ≤ 8`, the possible values for `x` can range from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `x` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
