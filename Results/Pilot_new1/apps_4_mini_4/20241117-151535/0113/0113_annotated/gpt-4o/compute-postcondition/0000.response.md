The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of \(10\) raised to the power of \(k\). Since \(k\) is a non-negative integer ranging from \(0\) to \(8\), the possible values for `multiplier` can be \(1\) (when \(k = 0\)), \(10\) (when \(k = 1\)), \(100\) (when \(k = 2\)), \(1000\) (when \(k = 3\)), \(10000\) (when \(k = 4\)), \(100000\) (when \(k = 5\)), \(1000000\) (when \(k = 6\)), \(10000000\) (when \(k = 7\)), and \(100000000\) (when \(k = 8\)). The values of `n` and `k` do not change, and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is 10 ** k**.**
