The value of `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. The initial states of `N`, `K`, and the list `A` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `gcd` and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, and `gcd` is `A[0]`**
