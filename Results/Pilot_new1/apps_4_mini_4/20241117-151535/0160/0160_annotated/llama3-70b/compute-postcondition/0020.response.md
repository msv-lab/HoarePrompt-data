The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is `gcd`, and since `gcd` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, the new value of `max_divisor` will remain `gcd` if `gcd` is greater than `i`, or it will be updated to `i` if `i` is greater than `gcd`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is either `gcd` or `i`, depending on the comparison between `gcd` and `i`**
