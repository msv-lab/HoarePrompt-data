The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`. Given that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, `max_divisor` will be either its previous value (which is `gcd`) or 1. Since `gcd` is divisible by `i`, the maximum will remain as `gcd`. Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
