Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` found in the range from 1 to the square root of `gcd`. If `gcd` is at least 1, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. If `gcd` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `max_divisor` will remain unchanged from its initial value. If `gcd` is 1, the loop executes once, and `max_divisor` will be 1. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` will not be updated when `i * i` equals `gcd`.**
