Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a sorted list of its divisors in descending order. If `x` is less than 1, it returns an empty list since no divisors can be found. If `x` is 1, it returns a list containing only the number 1. The function does not restrict the input to be between 2 and 500, so it can handle any integer value for `x`. **
