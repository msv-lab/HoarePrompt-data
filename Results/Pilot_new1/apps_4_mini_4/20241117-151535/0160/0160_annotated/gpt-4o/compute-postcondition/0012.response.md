The integer division `x // i` is calculated, where `x` remains unchanged and `i` is the next value (previous value + 1). The result of this division is then added to the `divisors` set. Since the previous value of `i` has been incremented, we can determine the new value of `i`. The states of `N`, `K`, and `A` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `x` remains unchanged, `i` is the next value (previous value + 1), and `divisors` has been updated to include the value `x // i`.**
