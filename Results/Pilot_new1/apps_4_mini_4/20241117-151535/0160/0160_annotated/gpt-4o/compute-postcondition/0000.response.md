The variable `divisors` is initialized as an empty set. The initial values of `N`, `K`, and `A` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `divisors` while keeping the other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set.**
