According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` for the loop to have reached its end. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

Since `N`, `K`, and `A` do not affect the loop's continuation directly, they do not need to be adjusted. The only adjustment needed is for `i` to reflect the next value in the range.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` includes the integers 1 and `K`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
