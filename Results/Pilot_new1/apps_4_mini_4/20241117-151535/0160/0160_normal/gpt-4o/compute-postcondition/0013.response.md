Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` includes the integers 1 and `K`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` will also include `i` and the quotient `x // i`.***
