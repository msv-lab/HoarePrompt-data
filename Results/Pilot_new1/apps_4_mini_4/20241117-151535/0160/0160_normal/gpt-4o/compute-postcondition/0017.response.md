The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is an integer `K` that is a non-negative integer up to \(10^9\). The function returns the sorted list of positive divisors of `K` in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `K` and return its positive divisors sorted in descending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer K and returns the sorted list of its positive divisors in descending order.**
