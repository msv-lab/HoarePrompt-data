Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` includes the integers 1 and `K` if `K` is divisible by `i` (which is 1), and `i` remains 1 while `x` is equal to `K`. There are no changes to `divisors` or other variables if `K` is not divisible by `i`, but since `i` is 1, `K` will always be divisible by 1.***
