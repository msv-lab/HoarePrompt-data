According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` is equal to `K`. Since `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is also greater than 0, which means `int(math.sqrt(x))` will be at least 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. We also need to ensure that `i` (which is now 2) is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(K))`. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be updated to 2. The value of `x` does not need to change as it will remain equal to `K`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` includes the integers 1 and `K`, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `K`**
