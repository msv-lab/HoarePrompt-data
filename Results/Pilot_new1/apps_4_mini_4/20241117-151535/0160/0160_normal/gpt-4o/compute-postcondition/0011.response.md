The code adds the integer `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` already includes the integers 1 and `K`, the previous values of `divisors` are not affected by this addition. The output state reflects that `i` is now also included in `divisors`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` includes the integers 1, `K`, and `i`, `x` is at least `(i + 1)`**
