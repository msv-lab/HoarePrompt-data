According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `gcd`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `gcd` must be at least 1, because the square root of a non-positive number is not a valid range for the loop. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the current divisor being checked, starting from 1. If `gcd` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and set `i` to 1 as the starting point for the loop.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is 1**
