The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `i` is 1, the value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged because `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
