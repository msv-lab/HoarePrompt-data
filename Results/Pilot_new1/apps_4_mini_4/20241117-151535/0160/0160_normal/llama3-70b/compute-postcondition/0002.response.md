The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. The initial state of `N`, `K`, and the list `A` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state describes the values of `N`, `K`, and the first element of `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, and `gcd` is `A[0]`**
