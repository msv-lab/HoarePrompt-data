The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Given that `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum of `gcd` and `gcd // i`. Since `i` is 1, `gcd // i` is equal to `gcd`. Therefore, `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)` will be `gcd`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1**
