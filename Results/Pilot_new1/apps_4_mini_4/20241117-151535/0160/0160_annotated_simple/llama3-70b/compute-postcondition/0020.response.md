The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` (which is greater than or equal to 1) and `i` is 2, we need to compare these two values. 

If `gcd` (and thus `max_divisor`) is greater than or equal to 2, `max_divisor` will remain unchanged. If `gcd` is less than 2, then `max_divisor` will be updated to 2. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd` or updated to 2 depending on the value of `gcd`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is either equal to `gcd` (if `gcd` >= 2) or `max_divisor` is updated to 2 (if `gcd` < 2), `i` is 2**
