The value of `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The code adds this value of `i` to the `divisors` set. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that now includes the integer `i`, and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that now includes the integer `i`, and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
