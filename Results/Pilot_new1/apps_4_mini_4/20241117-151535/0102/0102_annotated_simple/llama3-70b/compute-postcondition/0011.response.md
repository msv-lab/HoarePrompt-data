Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the function prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list based on the value of `s`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the function prints the English words representation of `s`, combining the appropriate entry from the `tens` list and the `ones` list, ensuring that if `s` is a multiple of 10, no hyphen and ones word is printed.***
