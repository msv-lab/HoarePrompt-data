The code initializes a list named `ones` that contains the string representations of the integers from 0 to 9. The variable `n` remains unchanged as there are no operations affecting it. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, and `ones` is a list containing the strings ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'].

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99; `ones` is a list containing the strings ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']**
