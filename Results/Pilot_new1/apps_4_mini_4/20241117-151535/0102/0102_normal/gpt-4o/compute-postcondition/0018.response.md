The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive), the function returns the string representation of `s` from the list `ones`. If `s` is between 11 and 19 (inclusive), the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99 (inclusive) but not in the `teens`, and if `s` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the `tens` list. If `s` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `s` in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` within the specified range and return its string representation based on the defined conditions for different ranges of `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, and returns its string representation based on its value: if `s` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from `ones`; if `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns from `teens`; if `s` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns from `tens`; otherwise, it returns a combined string representation for values not covered by the above cases.**
