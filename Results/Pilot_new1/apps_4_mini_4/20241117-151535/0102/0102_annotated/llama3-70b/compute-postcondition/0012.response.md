Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` in words, combining the appropriate entry from the `tens` list and the `ones` list, with a hyphen included if `s` is not a multiple of 10.***
