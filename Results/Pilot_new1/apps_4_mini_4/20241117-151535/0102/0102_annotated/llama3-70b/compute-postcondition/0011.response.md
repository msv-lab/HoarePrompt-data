Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the printed output is the string representation of `s` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the printed output is the string representation of `s` in words, derived from the `tens` list and the `ones` list, formatted appropriately with a hyphen if necessary.***
