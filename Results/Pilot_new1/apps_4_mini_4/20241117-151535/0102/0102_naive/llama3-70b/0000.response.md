Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly converts an integer score (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) into its English word representation, adhering to the problem description. 

Here's why the code works correctly for all specified cases:

1. For scores between 0 and 9, it directly accesses the `ones` list and prints the corresponding word.
2. For scores between 10 and 19, it accesses the `teens` list, adjusting the index correctly by subtracting 10.
3. For scores 20 and above (up to 99), it constructs the word using the `tens` list for the tens place and the `ones` list for the units place, correctly formatting the output with a hyphen when necessary.

The program handles all edge cases, such as:
- The score 0, which outputs "zero" (though not explicitly mentioned in the description, it is implied as part of the range).
- The score 10, which outputs "ten".
- The score 20, which outputs "twenty".
- The score 99, which outputs "ninety-nine".

Therefore, I cannot find any instance where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
