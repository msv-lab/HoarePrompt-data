To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and check if it handles all cases correctly.

The problem requires converting an integer score (between 0 and 99) into its English word representation, ensuring that:
- Numbers from 0 to 9 are represented as single words (e.g., "zero", "one", ... "nine").
- Numbers from 10 to 19 are represented correctly, with "ten" being a special case.
- Numbers from 20 to 99 should be represented as a combination of tens and ones, with a hyphen separating them (e.g., "twenty-one", "ninety-nine").

Now let's examine the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    ones = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']
    teens = ['', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']
    tens = ['', 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']
    if 0 <= n <= 9:
        return ones[n]
    elif 11 <= n <= 19:
        return teens[n - 10]
    elif 10 <= n <= 99:
        if n % 10 == 0:
            return tens[n // 10]
        else:
            return tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Handling numbers 0 to 9**: The first condition correctly returns the word for numbers 0 to 9 using the `ones` list.
2. **Handling numbers 10 to 19**: The second condition checks for numbers 11 to 19 but incorrectly skips "ten" (which is 10). The `teens` array also starts with an empty string for 10, which means the program will not handle the case for "ten" correctly.
3. **Handling numbers 20 to 99**: The last condition correctly formats numbers by checking if they are multiples of ten and combining the tens and ones with a hyphen for numbers that are not multiples of ten.

### Missing Logic:
The program fails to handle the number 10 correctly, as it does not return "ten" when `n` is exactly 10. 

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not work correctly for the input `10`, it does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
