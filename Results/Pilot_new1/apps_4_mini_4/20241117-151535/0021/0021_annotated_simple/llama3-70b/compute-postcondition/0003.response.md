The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is within the range 2 to 100, and `a` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, meaning that `n` will definitely be present in `a`. The previous value of `pos1` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the original values of `n`, `a`, and `pos1`, along with the new value of `posn`, which is the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`.**
