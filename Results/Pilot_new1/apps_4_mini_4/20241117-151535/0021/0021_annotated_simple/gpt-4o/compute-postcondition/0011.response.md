Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from either end of the list to the positions of the integer 1 and the integer `n`, and prints this maximum distance. The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the expected format or constraints, such as if the list does not contain the integers 1 or `n`. **
