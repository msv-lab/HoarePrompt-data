The code assigns `min_pos` the value of the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The variable `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and since `1` is assumed to be one of the integers within the list, `min_pos` will hold the index of `1` in `a`. The output state reflects the values of `n`, `a`, and `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`.**
