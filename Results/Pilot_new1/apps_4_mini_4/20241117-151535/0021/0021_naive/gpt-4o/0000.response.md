To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it in the context of the problem description.

The problem requires us to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The program first finds the index of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
2. It then calculates the distances from both the minimum and maximum elements to both ends of the array (positions 0 and n-1).
3. Finally, it takes the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Potential Issues:
- The program calculates distances assuming that the swap can only move the minimum and maximum elements to the ends of the array. However, it does not consider the case where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array and that no effective swap can increase the distance further than already present.
- For example, if the input is:
   ```
   2
   1 2
   ```
   The minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (2) is at index 1. The distance is already 1. The program would calculate distances as follows:
   - dist1 = abs(0 - 1) = 1
   - dist2 = abs(1 - 1) = 0
   - dist3 = abs(0 - 0) = 0
   - dist4 = abs(1 - 0) = 1
   The maximum distance output would be 1, which is correct, but the program does not perform an actual swap since it can't increase the distance. This means it does not fulfill the requirement of performing exactly one swap.

- Another case to consider is:
   ```
   4
   1 2 3 4
   ```
   The minimum (1) is at index 0 and the maximum (4) is at index 3. The distance is already 3. The program would calculate:
   - dist1 = abs(0 - 3) = 3
   - dist2 = abs(3 - 1) = 2
   - dist3 = abs(0 - 0) = 0
   - dist4 = abs(3 - 0) = 3
   The maximum distance output would be 3, which is correct, but it does not perform any meaningful swap.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the requirement of performing a meaningful swap to maximize the distance. It calculates the maximum distance based on static positions without considering the effect of an actual swap. Therefore, it does not adhere to the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
