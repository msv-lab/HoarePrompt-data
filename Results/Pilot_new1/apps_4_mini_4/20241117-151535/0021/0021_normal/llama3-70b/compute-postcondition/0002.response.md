The code assigns `pos1` the index of the value `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input and `1` is expected to be one of those integers (as it is a distinct integer), `pos1` will hold the index of `1` in the list `a`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`.**
