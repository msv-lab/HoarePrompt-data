The variable `dist3` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - min_pos)`. The value of `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`. Thus, `dist3` will be the absolute value of `min_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is the list of `n` distinct integers provided by the user; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`**
