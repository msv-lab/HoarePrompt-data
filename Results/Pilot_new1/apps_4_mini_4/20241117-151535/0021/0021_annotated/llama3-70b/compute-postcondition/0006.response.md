To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet provided.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in list `a`.
   - `posn` is `n - 1`, which represents the last index in the list `a`.
   - `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
   - `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

2. **Calculating `max_dist` and `min_dist`**:
   - `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` calculates the distance between the position of `1` and the last index, minus one.
   - `n - 2` is a constant that represents the maximum possible distance between any two distinct integers in the list, minus one.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The code `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))` calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `max_dist`, `min_dist`, and the result of the print statement.

Since the specific values of `pos1`, `n`, and the contents of `a` are not provided, we cannot calculate exact numerical results, but we can summarize the relationships and the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is `n - 1`; `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`; `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`; print outputs the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.**
