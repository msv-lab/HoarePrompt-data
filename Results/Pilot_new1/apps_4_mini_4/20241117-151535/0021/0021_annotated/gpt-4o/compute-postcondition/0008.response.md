The code attempts to calculate `max_distance` using the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. 

- `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.
- `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, which is a valid calculation since both `n` and `max_pos` are defined.
- `dist3` cannot be calculated because `min_pos` is undefined.
- `dist4` also cannot be calculated for the same reason.

Since `dist3` and `dist4` are undefined, the `max` function will raise an error due to the presence of undefined variables.

Therefore, the output state reflects the inability to compute `max_distance` due to the undefined values of `dist3` and `dist4`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `min_pos` is undefined; `dist3` cannot be calculated; `dist4` cannot be calculated; and an error occurs due to undefined `dist3` and `dist4`.**
