The code assigns the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in the list `a` to the variable `min_pos`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, so we need to ensure that `1` is present in the list for the `index` method to work correctly. The value of `min_pos` will be the position of `1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`.**
