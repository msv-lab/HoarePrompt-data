The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`, which calculates the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is determined by the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Since `max_pos` is an index, it will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, `dist1` will simply be the value of `max_pos`.

The output state reflects the values of the variables after this calculation. Since `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of distinct integers, and `max_pos` is defined, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos**.
