To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
Nicholas has an array of distinct integers from 1 to n, and he wants to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap. The output should be the maximum possible distance after the swap.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers.
2. It locates the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates the distance from both elements to the ends of the list (positions 0 and n-1).
4. It finds the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Edge Cases:
- The program assumes that both 1 and n are present in the list `a`, which is guaranteed by the problem description (distinct integers from 1 to n). Therefore, this assumption is valid.
- The code computes the distances to both ends of the list but does not consider the actual swapping of elements, which could potentially change their positions. However, the distances calculated are based on the initial positions of 1 and n, which is sufficient for this problem as we are only looking for the maximum distance achievable with one swap.

### Comparison with Examples:
- For the input `5` and array `4 5 1 3 2`, the output is `3`, which is correct since swapping `1` with `2` maximizes the distance to `4`.
- For the input `7` and array `1 6 5 3 4 7 2`, the output is `6`, which is correct since swapping `7` with `2` places `1` and `7` at the ends of the array.
- For the input `6` and array `6 5 4 3 2 1`, the output is `5`, which is correct since `1` and `6` are already at the ends.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly calculates the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap. The annotations align with the code's logic, confirming that it handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True** 

The reasoning is based on the fact that the code accurately computes the maximum distance achievable by swapping, and all provided examples confirm that the output is as expected for the problem requirements.
