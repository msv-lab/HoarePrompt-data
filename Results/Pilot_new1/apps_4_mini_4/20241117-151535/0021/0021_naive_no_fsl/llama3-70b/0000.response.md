To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The goal is to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array after performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between their positions.

Let's break down the program:

1. It reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) using `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`.
3. It calculates the current distance between these two positions.
4. It attempts to compute the maximum possible distance after one swap.

However, upon reviewing the logic:

- The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` seems incorrect. The formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` does not correctly account for the scenario where the minimum and maximum elements are swapped to the ends of the array. 
- The program also seems to assume that the maximum distance achievable after one swap is simply derived from the current positions, which is not necessarily true. 

To illustrate a potential case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case:
- `pos1` (position of 1) = 0
- `posn` (position of 5) = 4
- The current distance is `abs(0 - 4) = 4`.

The maximum distance possible after one swap should be `4` (swapping 1 with 5 to achieve positions `4` and `0`), and the output should be `4`. However, the program will incorrectly calculate this distance due to its flawed logic.

Since the program does not correctly handle the cases where the maximum distance is achievable by swapping the elements to the ends of the array, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
