The values of `a` and `b` are swapped. The new value of `a` is the previous value of `b`, and the new value of `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`, where the previous value of `b` is greater than 0. So, after execution, `a` takes the value of the previous `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`, and the previous value of `b` is greater than 0**
