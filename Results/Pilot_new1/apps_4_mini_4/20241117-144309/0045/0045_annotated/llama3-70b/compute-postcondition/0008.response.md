The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. The function returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Since `b` is 0 at the start, the function will return `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the value of `a` as the GCD when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns a as the GCD when b is 0.**
