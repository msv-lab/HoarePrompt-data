The values of `a` and `b` are swapped in the assignment `a, b = b, a % b`. Since `b` is the result of `a % b`, we know that `b` is less than `a`. After the operation, `a` will take the value of the previous `b`, and `b` will take the value of `a % b`, which is the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`. 

Given that `a` is greater than `b`, the new value of `b` will be a positive integer less than the previous value of `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b`. 

Output State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b` which is less than the previous value of `b`**
