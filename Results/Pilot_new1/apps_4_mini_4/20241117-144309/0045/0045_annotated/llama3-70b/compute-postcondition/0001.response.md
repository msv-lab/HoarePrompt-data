According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. 

Since `b` is the result of `a % b`, this implies that `a` must have been greater than or equal to `b` for `b` to be non-zero (as `a % b` equals zero only when `a` is a multiple of `b`). Therefore, to ensure that `b` is non-zero, we need to adjust the state such that `a` is not a multiple of `b`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `a` is not equal to `k * b` for any integer `k`, which means we can state that `a` must be greater than `b` for the next iteration.

State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`**
