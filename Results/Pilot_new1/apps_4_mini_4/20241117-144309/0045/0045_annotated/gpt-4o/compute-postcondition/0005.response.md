The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are known. The calculation for `remainder` will depend on the specific values of these variables. Since `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, the value of `d` is an integer that represents how many times `min_sum` can fit into `n`. Therefore, `remainder` will represent the leftover amount after accounting for the maximum multiples of `min_sum` that can be subtracted from `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is equal to `n - d * min_sum`**
