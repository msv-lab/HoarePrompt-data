The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first checks if the minimum required sum, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If not, it calculates a base sequence where each element is multiplied by a quotient `d`, derived from dividing `n` by the minimum sum. It then distributes any remaining value (if `n` is greater than the minimum sum) across the last `k` elements of the sequence, incrementing them as necessary. The final output is the modified sequence.
