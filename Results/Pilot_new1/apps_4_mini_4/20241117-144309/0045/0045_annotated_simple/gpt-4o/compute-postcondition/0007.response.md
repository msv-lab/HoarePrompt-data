According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0, since the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, we know that `k` must be at least `1` for the loop to run.

At the start of the loop, `i` will take the value of `k - 1` in the first iteration, and it will decrement down to `0`. The values of `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop itself, but they can provide context about the program state.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is at least `1`. Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are that `k` must be greater than or equal to `1`, and `i` will start at `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of values [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd], `i` is `k - 1`**
