The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is `k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
