Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking.***
