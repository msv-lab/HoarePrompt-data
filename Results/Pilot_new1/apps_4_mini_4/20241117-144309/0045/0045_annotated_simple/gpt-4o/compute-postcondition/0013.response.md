According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, which means it has been decremented to `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted back to `k - 2`. 

Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is now `k - 2`, which is still greater than or equal to `0` if `k` is at least `1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence[i]` are not directly affected by the loop index decrement.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`**
