To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description:
We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n`, while maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
   if (min_sum > n):
       return -1
   ```
   The minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers is calculated. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1`, which is correct since it's impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Divisor Calculation**:
   ```python
   d = n // min_sum
   remainder = n - d * min_sum
   sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
   ```
   Here, `d` is the factor by which the minimum sequence can be multiplied to stay within the sum `n`. The initial sequence is generated as multiples of `d`.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
       if remainder == 0:
           break
       
       sequence[i] += 1
       remainder -= 1
   ```
   The loop attempts to distribute any remaining value (`remainder`) to the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `n` is not divisible by `min_sum` properly. If `n` is not a multiple of the `min_sum`, the sequence generated might not maximize the GCD as expected. The GCD is maximized when all elements can be divided by the same number, which is not guaranteed by simply distributing the remainder.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
n = 10
k = 3
```
- The minimum sum (`min_sum`) for `k = 3` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- Here, `d = 10 // 6 = 1` and `remainder = 10 - 6 = 4`.
- The initial sequence will be `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The loop will increment the last elements, resulting in `[1, 2, 7]` or similar, which does not maximize the GCD. The GCD of `[1, 2, 7]` is `1`, but a better sequence like `[2, 3, 5]` would yield a GCD of `1` as well, but it doesn't utilize the maximum divisor possible.

### Conclusion:
Since there are cases where the program does not produce the correct sequence according to the problem's requirements, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**
