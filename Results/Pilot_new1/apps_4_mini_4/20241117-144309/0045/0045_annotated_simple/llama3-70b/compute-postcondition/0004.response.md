The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the values according to the expression `a, b = b, a % b`. Given that `a` is `n % k` and `b` is `k % (n % k)`, we can substitute these values into the expression. 

1. The new value of `a` will be the old value of `b`, which is `k % (n % k)`.
2. The new value of `b` will be the result of `a % b`, which translates to `(n % k) % (k % (n % k))`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` after the assignment, while the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `n % k`, `b` is `k % (n % k)`, `a` is `k % (n % k)`, `b` is `(n % k) % (k % (n % k))`**
