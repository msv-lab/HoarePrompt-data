The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum` which equals 0, `sequence` is a list of the first `k` multiples of `d`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
