To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of \( k \) positive integers such that:
   - The sum of the sequence equals \( n \).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized.
2. If no such sequence exists, the output should be -1.

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   - The program first calculates the minimum sum required for a strictly increasing sequence of \( k \) numbers, which is given by the formula \( \text{min\_sum} = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \). If this minimum sum exceeds \( n \), the program correctly returns -1.
  
2. **Divisor Calculation**:
   - The program calculates \( d \) as \( d = \frac{n}{\text{min\_sum}} \), which is intended to scale the minimum sequence up to potentially reach \( n \).
   - The sequence is created as \( \text{sequence} = [d \times (i + 1) \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(k)] \).

3. **Handling Remainder**:
   - The program then calculates the remainder when \( n \) is reduced by \( d \times \text{min\_sum} \) and adjusts the last elements of the sequence by incrementing them until the remainder is exhausted.

### Potential Cases:
1. **Case When \( n < k \)**:
   - If \( n \) is less than \( k \), the program should return -1 since it is impossible to create \( k \) positive integers that sum up to \( n \). However, the program does not explicitly check for this case before calculating the minimum sum, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

2. **Testing with \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \)**:
   - The program correctly identifies that the minimum sum for \( k = 3 \) is \( 6 \) (i.e., \( 1 + 2 + 3 \)), which is greater than \( 5 \), so it returns -1.

3. **Testing with \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 3 \)**:
   - The program will produce the sequence \( [1, 2, 3] \) which sums to \( 6 \) and has a GCD of \( 1 \).

4. **Testing with \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 2 \)**:
   - The program will produce the sequence \( [2, 6] \) which sums to \( 8 \) and has a GCD of \( 2 \).

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and considering edge cases, the program behaves correctly for the examples provided. However, it may not handle cases where \( n < k \) correctly without an explicit check for this condition. 

Thus, since the program does not guarantee correct behavior for all potential inputs as required by the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
