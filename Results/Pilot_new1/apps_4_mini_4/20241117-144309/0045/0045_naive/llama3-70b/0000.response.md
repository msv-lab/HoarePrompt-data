To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

The problem requires creating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers that sum up to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD). If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Given Program:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1` since it is impossible to create a sequence of `k` positive numbers that sum up to `n`.

2. **Building the Sequence**: The program tries to build a sequence of the first `k` natural numbers (1, 2, ..., k). It keeps adding these numbers to the sequence until it can no longer do so without exceeding `n`.

3. **Final Check**: After attempting to build the sequence, it checks if the length of `seq` is equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`. If it is, it prints the sequence.

### Potential Issue:
While the program builds the sequence of the first `k` natural numbers, it does not consider the requirement of maximizing the GCD of the sequence. 

For instance, if we take `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program will produce `1 2 3` which sums to `6`. However, a better sequence would be `2 4 6`, which sums to `12` and has a GCD of `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to maximize the GCD of the resulting sequence. It only considers the first `k` natural numbers, which does not guarantee that the GCD is maximized.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure:
For input `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program outputs `1 2 3`, which has a GCD of `1` and sums to `6`. The correct output should be `2 4 6`, which sums to `12` and has a GCD of `2`.
