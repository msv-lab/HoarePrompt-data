Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers without leading zeros, with `a` having a length greater than or equal to `b`. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The program correctly handles the cases where `b` is empty by treating it as '0', and if `a` is empty, it is treated as '0', ensuring all edge cases are covered in the comparisons.***
