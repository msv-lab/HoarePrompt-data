The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`, which means it is now a string representing the number zero. The initial state indicates that `b` was empty, but after the assignment, `b` is now `'0'`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, and if it was empty, it would have been set to `'0'`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `b` while `a` remains as is.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0'**
