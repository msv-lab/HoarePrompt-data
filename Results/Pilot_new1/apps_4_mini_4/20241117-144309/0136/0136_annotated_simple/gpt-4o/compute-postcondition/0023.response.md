Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings representing numbers without leading zeroes, or '0' if they are empty, and their lengths are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons are valid due to the precondition that ensures `a` and `b` are properly formatted strings of equal length.***
