The value of `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `data` is a list of strings obtained from user input, `data[0]` can be any non-negative integer string, including a string of zeroes. 

If `data[0]` consists solely of zeroes, `a` will be assigned an empty string. If `data[0]` contains other digits, `a` will be the string representation of that integer without leading zeroes. The variable `b` remains unaffected as it is not part of this operation.

Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `data[0]`. 

Output State: **`a` is `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` remains unchanged**
