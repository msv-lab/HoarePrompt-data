Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where the inputs are both "0". In this case, after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` would become an empty string, leading to incorrect comparisons. Specifically, if both inputs are "0", the expected output should be "=", but the program would not handle this correctly because it compares two empty strings, resulting in the output being ">", which is incorrect.
