Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings without leading zeros, where if `a` is empty, it is treated as '0', and if `b` is empty, it is also treated as '0'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the output will be '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. All conditions regarding the values of `a` and `b` are maintained, ensuring valid comparisons.***
