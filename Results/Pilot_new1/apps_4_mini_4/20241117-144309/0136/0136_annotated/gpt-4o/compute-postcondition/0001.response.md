The value of `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, the leading zeros will be stripped from it. The value of `b` and `data` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.**
