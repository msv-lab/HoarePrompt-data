To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description:
Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to modify it to a triangle of side length `y`. The task is to find the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this, where each second allows changing one side of the triangle while ensuring it remains non-degenerate (i.e., having positive area).

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent the starting and ending side lengths of the triangle, respectively.
2. **Calculation**: The program calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)`.
3. **Output**: It prints this difference.

### Correctness Check:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of seconds needed to change the triangle from side length `x` to `y`. However, the logic of simply taking the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` does not accurately reflect the operations needed to maintain a non-degenerate triangle.

#### Example Case:
Let's consider the input:
```
6 3
```
- The expected steps to transform (6, 6, 6) to (3, 3, 3) would take 4 seconds as described in the problem statement.
- The program would output `3` since `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly account for the operations needed to maintain a non-degenerate triangle while transitioning from `x` to `y`. It oversimplifies the problem by only calculating the difference, which does not reflect the actual number of operations required.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
