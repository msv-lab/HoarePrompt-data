The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the constraints that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the absolute difference `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer since `x` is always greater than `y`. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but the output will be a positive integer based on their difference.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on the input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(`x - y`) which is a positive integer**
