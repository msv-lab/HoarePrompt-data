The provided Python program is supposed to compute the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. The problem states that the side lengths must remain integers and that the triangle must remain non-degenerate (which means no side can be equal to or less than zero).

The code given is as follows:

```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
```

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. According to the problem description, `x` must be greater than `y` (specifically, `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`).

2. **Logic**: The program calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using `abs(x - y)` and prints this value.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The problem requires that the program computes the minimum number of modifications needed to transform the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`. 
   - The output of the program (i.e., `abs(x - y)`) does not account for the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate during the transformation process. The code simply returns the difference in lengths without considering the steps needed to ensure that each side length remains positive and that the triangle remains valid throughout the process.

### Edge Cases and Missing Logic
- Consider the case where `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The program would output `3` (the absolute difference), but the necessary steps to transform `(6, 6, 6)` to `(3, 3, 3)` involve multiple adjustments that cannot be reduced to just a single subtraction.
- The annotations mention that the function does not enforce any constraints on `x` and `y`, which suggests that it could theoretically handle invalid inputs. However, the problem explicitly states constraints that must be respected.
- The program does not handle the necessary intermediate steps and the requirement that all sides must remain positive integers, which is critical for maintaining a valid triangle.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description correctly, as it fails to compute the actual number of modifications needed while ensuring that all side lengths remain valid throughout the process. Given these considerations, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to transform the triangle while adhering to the constraints of non-degeneracy and integer side lengths.
