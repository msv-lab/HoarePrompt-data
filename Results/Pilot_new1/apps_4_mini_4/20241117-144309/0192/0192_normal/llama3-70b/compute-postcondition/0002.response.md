The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers with the conditions that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. 

Since the output details are not provided, I will describe the expected behavior based on the constraints. Given these constraints, the function is likely designed to perform some operations or calculations involving `x` and `y`, but without specific output information, I cannot detail the exact return values.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate with the integers `x` and `y`, which must satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. However, the specific return value or behavior of the function is not defined in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates with integers x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
