The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers with the conditions that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value or behavior without additional context. Therefore, based on the available information:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified.**
