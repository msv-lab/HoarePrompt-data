To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

The problem requires calculating the probability of at least two people having the same birthday when there are \(2^n\) days in a year and \(k\) people being interviewed. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where \(A\) and \(B\) are coprime numbers.

### Code Analysis
1. The program calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\).
2. It initializes the numerator and denominator for the probability calculation.
3. It uses a loop to calculate the product for the numerator, which corresponds to the probability that no two people share a birthday.
4. The denominator is simply the total number of ways to assign a birthday to \(k\) people, which is \( (2^n)^k \).
5. After calculating the numerator and denominator, the program computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) to reduce the fraction.
6. Finally, it returns the values of \(A\) and \(B\) modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Potential Issues
1. **Overflow and Performance**: The values of \(n\) and \(k\) can be as large as \(10^{18}\). The calculations for `numerator` and `denominator` could lead to extremely large numbers that may cause overflow or performance issues, even though Python handles big integers. However, the logic must ensure that it can handle such large values efficiently.
2. **Guaranteed Collision**: When \(k > 2^n\), the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is guaranteed to be 1 (i.e., \(A = 1\) and \(B = 1\)). The program does not explicitly handle this case, which could lead to incorrect results for large \(k\).
3. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**: The calculation of gcd is performed on the numerator and denominator before they are reduced modulo \(10^6 + 3\). This may lead to incorrect results if the gcd is computed on very large numbers without considering modular arithmetic.

### Test Case to Illustrate Failure
Consider the input:
```
1 3
```
Here, \(n = 1\) implies there are \(2^1 = 2\) days. Since \(k = 3\) (people), it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. Thus, the expected output is:
```
1 1
```
However, the program does not check if \(k > 2^n\) and will attempt to compute the numerator and denominator without this check, leading to potentially incorrect results.

### Conclusion
Given that the program does not handle the case where \(k > 2^n\) correctly and could produce incorrect results or even fail to execute properly for very large values, the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**.
