Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function calculates the probability of at least one pair sharing a value based on combinatorial principles, but it does not return any value or handle cases where `k` exceeds `total_days` properly, potentially leading to incorrect calculations. The function ultimately prints the reduced values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD`.**
