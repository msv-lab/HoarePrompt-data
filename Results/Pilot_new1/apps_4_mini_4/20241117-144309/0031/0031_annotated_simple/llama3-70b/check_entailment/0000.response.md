To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Breakdown:
- We are given `n` and `k`, where `2^n` represents the number of days in a year, and `k` is the number of people.
- We need to calculate the probability that at least two of the `k` people share the same birthday.
- The probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

### Understanding the Code:
1. **Initialization**: The program calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 2 ** n`.
2. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**:
   - The numerator is calculated as the product of the number of available days decreasing with each person added, which correctly represents the scenario where no two people share a birthday.
   - The denominator is simply \( total\_days^k \), representing all possible birthday combinations for `k` people.
3. **GCD Calculation**: The program computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction.
4. **Return Values**: The function returns the numerator and denominator modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `k > total_days`**: If `k` exceeds `2^n`, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, resulting in a probability of \( \frac{A}{B} = \frac{1}{1} \). The program does not handle this case explicitly, and thus it may return an incorrect result.
2. **When `k = 1`**: The program does not explicitly handle `k = 1`, but since the problem states `k >= 2`, this case is irrelevant.
3. **Large Values of `n` and `k`**: Given that both `n` and `k` can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), the calculations for `total_days` and the products for numerator and denominator could lead to overflow or excessive computation time.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` exceeds `total_days`, which is a crucial part of the problem description. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
