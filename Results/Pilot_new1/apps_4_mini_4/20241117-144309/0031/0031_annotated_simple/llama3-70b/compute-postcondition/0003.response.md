According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the loop will execute `k` times. The variable `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration. The states that need to be adjusted are related to the loop variable `i` and the number of iterations defined by `k`.

Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `i` is initially not defined but will be set to 0 at the beginning of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute properly, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
