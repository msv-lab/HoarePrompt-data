Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\) and computes the `numerator` as the product of values decreasing from `total_days` for `k` iterations, while the `denominator` is \(2^{(k \cdot n)}\). After calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the `numerator` and `denominator`, it reduces both by this GCD. Finally, the function returns the `numerator` and `denominator` modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is 0, the function will return 1 for both `numerator` and `denominator` since the loop does not execute.**
