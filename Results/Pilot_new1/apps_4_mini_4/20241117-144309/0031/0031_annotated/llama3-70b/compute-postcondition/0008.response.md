The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Previously, `denominator` is 2, and `total_days` is also 2. Therefore, after the execution, `denominator` will be 2 * 2 = 4. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is an integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 1**
