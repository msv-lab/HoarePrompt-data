The code assigns the value of `10 ** 6 + 3` to the variable `MOD`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `MOD` while keeping `n` and `k` as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**
