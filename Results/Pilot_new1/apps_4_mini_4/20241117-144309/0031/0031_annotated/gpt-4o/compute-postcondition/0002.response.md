The code snippet `print(1, 1)` outputs the values `1` and `1`. The initial state contains variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD`, but these variables are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the printed output is (1, 1)**.
