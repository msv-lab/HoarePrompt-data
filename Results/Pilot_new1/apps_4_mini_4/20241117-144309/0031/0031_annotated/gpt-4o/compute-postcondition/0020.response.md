The variable `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The initial state does not provide the value of `denominator`, but it indicates that `p_no_shared` is assigned a value based on a calculation involving `numerator`. However, the assignment of `p_total` does not affect `p_no_shared` or any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment made to `p_total`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.**
