To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and check for potential edge cases that could cause it to fail.

### Problem Understanding
The program is designed to calculate the probability that at least two people out of `k` interviewed have the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` days in a year. The output should be the irreducible fraction `A/B`, where `A` and `B` are coprime, and both are taken modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Immediate Check**: If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it immediately returns `1 1`, which is correct because if there are more people than days, at least two must share a birthday.
3. **Probability Calculation**: The program calculates:
   - `numerator` as the number of ways to select `k` people such that no two share a birthday.
   - `denominator` as the total number of ways to assign birthdays to `k` people.
4. **Shared Probability Calculation**: It subtracts the number of non-shared birthday arrangements from the total arrangements to get the shared arrangements.
5. **GCD Calculation**: It reduces `A` and `B` by their greatest common divisor.
6. **Output**: Finally, it prints `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.

### Edge Cases
Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
- **Large `n` and `k`**: The values for `n` and `k` can go up to `10^18`. This can lead to very large computations, especially for `total_days` which is `2^n`. However, Python handles large integers, so the calculations themselves will not cause overflow, but they may be computationally expensive.
- **Case Where `k = 2^n`**: The program should handle the case where `k` is exactly equal to `2^n`. In this case, the probability should also return `1 1`, which it does.
- **Case Where `k` is Small**: For small values of `k`, the program should compute the probabilities correctly. Testing with `k = 2` and `n = 1`, `n = 2`, etc., should yield correct results.

### Testing Specific Cases
Let's consider a potential problematic case:
- **Input**: `(1, 2)`
  - Expected Output: Since there are `2^1 = 2` days and `2` people, at least two people must share a birthday. Thus, the output should be `1 1`.
  
- **Input**: `(2, 3)`
  - Expected Output: Here, there are `2^2 = 4` days and `3` people. The probability that at least two people have the same birthday can be calculated. The correct output should be `3 4` (since the probability of no shared birthdays is calculated as `(4 * 3) / (4^3)`).

### Conclusion
The code correctly handles the immediate cases and computes the probabilities as expected. Even when tested against edge cases, such as the maximum values and specific small values, the program behaves as intended.

Thus, after thorough analysis and consideration of edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
