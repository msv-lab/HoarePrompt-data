The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`, which means it will convert each input string into an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` do not affect this operation, as `s` is a new variable. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is a list of integers from input.**
