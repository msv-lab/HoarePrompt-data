Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order, and `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` and `r` unchanged from their previous state.***
