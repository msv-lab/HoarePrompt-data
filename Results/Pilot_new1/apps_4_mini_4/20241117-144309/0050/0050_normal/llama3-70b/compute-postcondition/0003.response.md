The code snippet `s.sort()` sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The state of the list `s` will change to its sorted version, but the specific values of `s` are not known from the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is now sorted while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is sorted; `b` is a list of integers from input**
