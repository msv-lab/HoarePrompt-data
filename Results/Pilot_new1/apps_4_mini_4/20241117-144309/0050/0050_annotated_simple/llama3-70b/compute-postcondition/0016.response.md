The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `shares` is unchanged at 0, `r` is less than `s[i]`, `i` is less than `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
