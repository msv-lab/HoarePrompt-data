Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, and `shares` remains unchanged at 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` unchanged and `r` still less than `s[i]`. This ensures that `shares` is only modified when `r` is sufficient to cover the current value of `s[i]`.***
