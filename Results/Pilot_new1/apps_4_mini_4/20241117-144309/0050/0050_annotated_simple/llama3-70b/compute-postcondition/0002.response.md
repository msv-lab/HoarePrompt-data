The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created from the input values, where the input values are split into separate strings and then converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new assignment for `b` and the unchanged state of other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers created from input values; `b` is a list of integers from input values.**
