The code initializes `s` as a list of integers by taking input from the user, splitting the input string, and mapping each part to an integer. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly altered by this line of code, but `s` will now hold a list of integers based on the input provided. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, and `s` is a list of integers from input.**
