Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer assigned from input, `r` is an integer assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in reverse order, and `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[1]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and no changes are made to `shares` or `r`. Additionally, if `s` has fewer than 2 elements, or if `s[1]` is zero, the program may encounter a division by zero error or undefined behavior.***
