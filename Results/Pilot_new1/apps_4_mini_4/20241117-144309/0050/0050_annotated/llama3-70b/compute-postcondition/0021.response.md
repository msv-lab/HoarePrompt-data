The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer assigned from input, `r` is an integer assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in reverse order, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
