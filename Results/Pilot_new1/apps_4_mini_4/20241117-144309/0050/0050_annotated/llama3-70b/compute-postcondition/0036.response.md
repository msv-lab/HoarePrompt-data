Postcondition: ***`shares` is greater than or equal to 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated by adding `shares * b[1]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` unchanged and maintaining the conditions that `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.***
