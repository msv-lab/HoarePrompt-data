The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers within specified ranges, but the value of `apartment` is undefined. Therefore, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `floor_within_block`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a`, `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the undefined variable `apartment`.**
