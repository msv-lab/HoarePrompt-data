The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\). It also accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(a \neq b\). 

The function does not explicitly return a value based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` with specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (integers between 1 and 1000) and a, b (integers between 1 and n·m·k, where a ≠ b).**
