Functionality: ** The function accepts five integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the minimum time required to move between two floors and blocks in a given structure based on the input parameters, taking into account block and floor differences. The function outputs the total time, which is the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time. The function does not handle any input validation or edge cases for invalid input values. **
