The variable `direct_walk_time` is assigned the value of `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not specified in the initial state, but they are integers that fall within the defined ranges. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, modulo `n`, multiplied by 15.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`**
