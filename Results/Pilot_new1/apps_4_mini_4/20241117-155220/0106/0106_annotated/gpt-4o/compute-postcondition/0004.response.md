The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number, where 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k. After executing the function, it calculates the values of 'block' and 'floor', where 'floor' is determined by the expression 'floor_within_block // k + 1'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the apartment number's position within a multi-block structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the apartment number's position within a multi-block structure.**
