To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state.

1. The initial state defines `direct_walk_time` as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. However, the specific values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not given, so we cannot calculate `direct_walk_time` numerically.

2. The code snippet computes `reverse_walk_time` using the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. This means we will calculate `reverse_walk_time` based on the same `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` that were used to define `direct_walk_time`.

3. The calculation of `reverse_walk_time` does not affect the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, but it introduces a new variable `reverse_walk_time`.

Given that we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`**
