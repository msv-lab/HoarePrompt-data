Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input; `a`, `b` are integers from input; `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `a_block`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are calculated values. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In either case, `min_floor_time` is adjusted based on the absolute difference between `a_floor` and `b_floor`, ensuring that it accounts for the minimum time required to traverse the floors.***
