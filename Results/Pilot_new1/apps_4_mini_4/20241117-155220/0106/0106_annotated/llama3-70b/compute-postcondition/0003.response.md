The variable `a_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a`, `m`, and `k`, which were assigned values from input. The expression calculates the integer division of `(a - 1)` by `(m * k)` and then adds 1. Therefore, the output state will include the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input; `a`, `b` are the two integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
