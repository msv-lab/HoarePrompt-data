The function accepts five integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` represent dimensions of a building, and `a` and `b` are identifiers for two locations within that building. It calculates the total time required to exit from location `a` and reach location `b`, which includes the time to exit the current floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is returned as the output.
