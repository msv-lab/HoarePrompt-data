To determine the output state after executing the given code, we need to analyze the impact of the code snippet on the initial state of the variables.

1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
2. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
3. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Since the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are defined by the function `get_location(a)` and the initial state, we can conclude that `min_walk_time` will be the lesser of the two computed walk times.

However, we do not have the specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`, so we cannot compute exact values. The output will reflect that `min_walk_time` is calculated based on the provided formulas.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is calculated as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`**.
