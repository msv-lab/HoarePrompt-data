To determine the output state, we need to evaluate the assignment of the variable `block` based on the provided formula. The formula calculates which block an apartment belongs to, based on its number and the dimensions of the apartment layout defined by `m` and `k`.

Given the initial state that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\), and `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers within the range \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\), we can see that the formula will compute a value for `block` based on either `a` or `b`.

However, since the values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot calculate a specific numeric value for `block`. Instead, we can describe the output state in terms of the variables and the formula used.

The variable `block` is assigned the value calculated by the expression \((apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1\), where `apartment` can be either `a` or `b`. The output state will reflect this assignment without specific values for `a` or `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers within the range 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k`; `block` is assigned the value of (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**.
