To determine the output state, let's break down the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables:

1. The variable `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
2. The values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are not specified, but we know they are integers within their respective ranges.
3. The calculation involves the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, which is then adjusted by `n` and multiplied by 15.

Since the specific values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not given, we cannot compute a specific numeric value for `reverse_walk_time`. However, we can describe the relationship and the resulting state of the variables:

- `reverse_walk_time` is assigned a value based on the calculation involving `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`, without providing a specific numeric result.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are values returned by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are values returned by `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.**
