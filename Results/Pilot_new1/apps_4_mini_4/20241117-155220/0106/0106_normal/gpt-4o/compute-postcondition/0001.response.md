The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not explicitly provided, but we know that `apartment` is one of the distinct integers `a` or `b`, and `m` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range. 

Since `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, the output state will reflect this calculation. The exact value of `floor_within_block` will depend on the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, but since these values are not provided, we can only describe the relationship.

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
