The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which accepts three positive integers separated by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unspecified, but they will now hold the values provided by the user input. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `k` now hold the values from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a` and `b` remain unchanged.**
