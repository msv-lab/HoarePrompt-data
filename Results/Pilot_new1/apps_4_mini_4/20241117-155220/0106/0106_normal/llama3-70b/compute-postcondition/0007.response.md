Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input integers. `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1. `b_floor` is dependent on the undefined variable `b`. `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, but `b` is undefined, so `min_block_time` cannot be calculated. The value of `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.***
