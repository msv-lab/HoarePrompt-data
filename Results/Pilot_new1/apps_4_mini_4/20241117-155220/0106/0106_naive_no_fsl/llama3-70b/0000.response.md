To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code against the problem description.

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of three integers `n`, `m`, `k` representing the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor respectively.
   - The second line provides two integers `a` and `b`, the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.
   - The output should be the minimum time in seconds for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

2. **Apartment and Floor Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the floor and block (entrance) for both apartments:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1` calculates the floor number for apartment `a`.
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` calculates the block number for apartment `a`.
     - Similar calculations are done for apartment `b`.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time to move between blocks is calculated based on the minimum distance in a circular manner, multiplied by 15 seconds per block.
   - The time to change floors is calculated based on the difference in floor numbers, with an additional 10 seconds for waiting for the lift.

4. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The calculation of `a_block` and `b_block` is incorrect. The formula used for block calculation should consider the total number of apartments per block, which is `m * k`, not just `m * k` as the denominator. The correct calculation should be:
     ```python
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where Edward is already on the same floor as Natasha, as it adds the lift time unnecessarily.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`. The program will incorrectly calculate the blocks and floors leading to an incorrect time output.

Given these observations, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and has logical flaws in its calculations.

Correctness: **False**
