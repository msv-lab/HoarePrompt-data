Output State: **`seen` is a set containing all unique remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set. If any remainder is repeated during the loop execution, 'No' is printed, and the program exits immediately. If `k` is at least 1, `i` will be at least 1 and at most `k`, and `remainder` will be the result of `n % i`, which could be any integer from 0 to `i-1`.**
