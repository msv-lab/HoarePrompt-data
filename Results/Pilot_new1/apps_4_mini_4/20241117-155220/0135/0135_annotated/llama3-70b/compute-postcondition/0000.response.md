The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only state that they will hold integer values within the range specified (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). The output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now assigned input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
