The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. Since `seen` may or may not already contain `remainder`, its state will change to include `remainder` if it wasn't there already. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
