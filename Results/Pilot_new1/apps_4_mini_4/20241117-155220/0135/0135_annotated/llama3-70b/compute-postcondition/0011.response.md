The code prints 'No', which does not change the values of any variables. The values of `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
