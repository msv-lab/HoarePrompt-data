Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `remainder` is not in `seen_remainders`, the function does not return anything, and the state of `seen_remainders` remains unchanged.***
