The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is 3. The possible values for `remainder` can be either 0 or 1 depending on the specific value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
