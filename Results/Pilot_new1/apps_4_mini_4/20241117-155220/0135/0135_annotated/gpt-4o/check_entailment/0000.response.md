To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's break down the logic step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to check whether all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**: 
   - The program first checks if `k >= n`. If this condition is true, the function returns 'No'.
   - This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the values of `n mod i` will definitely repeat for `i = n` (where the remainder is `0`), hence not all remainders can be distinct.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - If `k < n`, the program initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` and enters a loop from `1` to `k`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `remainder = n % i`.
   - It checks if this `remainder` has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If the remainder is new, it adds it to the `seen_remainders` set.

3. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The annotations indicate that if `k` is `2` or more, the first iteration will always find `0` in `seen_remainders` (since `n mod 1 = 0`), leading to an immediate return of 'No'. This is correct, as for any `n`, `n mod 1` will always be `0`, which means if `k >= 2`, the function will always return 'No'.
- The annotations state that if `k < 1`, the loop does not execute, and the function will implicitly return `None`. However, the problem description does not specify handling for `k < 1`, as it states that `1 ≤ k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether all remainders are distinct based on the rules provided in the problem description. However, the handling of `k < 1` is not explicitly addressed, and while the input constraints guarantee that `k` will always be at least `1`, the lack of handling for this case could lead to confusion.

Nevertheless, since the program correctly returns 'No' when `k >= n` and accurately checks for distinct remainders for valid inputs, I conclude that the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
