To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The problem asks us to check if the remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program does the following:

1. It reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the remainders.
3. It iterates over the range from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` when divided by `i`.
4. If the calculated remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints 'No' and exits.
5. If all remainders are distinct after the loop, it prints 'Yes'.

Let's analyze some specific cases:

1. **Case when k = 1**: 
   - If `n = 5`, then `n % 1 = 0`. The output should be 'Yes' since there is only one remainder.
   - If `n = 4`, the output should also be 'Yes'.
   - The program correctly handles this case.

2. **Case when k = 4 and n = 4**:
   - The remainders are: 
     - `4 % 1 = 0`
     - `4 % 2 = 0`
     - `4 % 3 = 1`
     - `4 % 4 = 0`
   - Here, we see that `0` appears multiple times. The correct output is 'No', which the program provides.

3. **Case when n = 5 and k = 3**:
   - The remainders are:
     - `5 % 1 = 0`
     - `5 % 2 = 1`
     - `5 % 3 = 2`
   - All remainders are distinct, so the output should be 'Yes', which the program correctly outputs.

4. **Edge case with large values**:
   - Let's consider `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`. 
   - The program will calculate `10^18 % i` for all `i` from `1` to `10^18`.
   - However, the remainders will not be distinct for all `i` because `10^18 % 10^18 = 0`, and `10^18 % (10^18 - 1)` will yield `1`, and so forth. There will definitely be repetitions for large values of `i`.

5. **General case for k > n**:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, then for `i` from `n+1` to `k`, `n % i` will always equal `n`, which means there will be a repetition of the remainder `n` for at least two values of `i`. Hence, the output should be 'No'.

Given the analysis, the program correctly identifies cases where the remainders are not distinct, including edge cases where `k` is greater than `n`.

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all remainders are distinct for any valid input within the constraints provided.
