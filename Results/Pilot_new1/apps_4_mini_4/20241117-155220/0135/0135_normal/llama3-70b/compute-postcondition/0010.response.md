The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and `n` is an input integer. Therefore, `remainder` will be the result of the modulus operation between the input integer `n` and 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`**
