The statement `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console. This action does not modify any of the variables in the program, so their states remain unchanged. The output state is as follows, reflecting the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now the set containing `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'**
