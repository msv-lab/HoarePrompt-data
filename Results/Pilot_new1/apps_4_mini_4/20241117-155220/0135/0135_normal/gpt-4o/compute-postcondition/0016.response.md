The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). 

- Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return anything, indicating that execution continues without any output.
  
- Case 2: If `k` is at least 1, the function checks for remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found in the set of `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains empty.

- Case 3: If none of the above conditions are met and no remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on their values, it returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, continues without output if `k` is less than `n`, returns 'No' if any remainders are found during checks, and returns 'Yes' if all conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, continues without output if `k` is less than `n`, returns 'No' if any remainder is found during checks, and returns 'Yes' if all conditions are satisfied.**
