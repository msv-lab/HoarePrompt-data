Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Since `seen_remainders` is initially empty, this implies that the function will return 'No' only if `remainder` has been previously encountered in another execution context where it was added to `seen_remainders`.***
