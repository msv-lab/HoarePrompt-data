According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `i` must still be less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 3 if we want the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be 3.
- `k` should be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
