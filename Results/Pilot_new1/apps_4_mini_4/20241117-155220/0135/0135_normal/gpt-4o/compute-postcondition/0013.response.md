According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current state indicates `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased to 4. Since `k` is at least 3, it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `seen_remainders` and `remainder` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2**
