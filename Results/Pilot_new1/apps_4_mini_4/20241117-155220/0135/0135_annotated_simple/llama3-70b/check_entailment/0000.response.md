To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the logic of the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine if all remainders of `n` when divided by every integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. The output should be "Yes" if they are distinct and "No" otherwise.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Set for Distinct Remainders**: It initializes an empty set `seen` to track the distinct remainders.
3. **Loop from 1 to k**:
   - For each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, it calculates `n % i`.
   - If the remainder has already been seen (exists in the set), it prints "No" and exits.
   - If not, it adds the remainder to the set.
4. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Potential Edge Cases:
- When `k` is very large (close to `10^18`), the loop will iterate many times, which is impractical. However, this does not affect correctness but rather efficiency.
- The case where `k = 1` will always result in "Yes" since the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always `0`.
- When `n` is much smaller than `k`, the program might still find repeated remainders for larger values of `i`.

### Key Insight:
The code correctly identifies distinct remainders for values of `i` from `1` to `k`. However, it fails to account for the fact that when `k` exceeds `n`, the remainders will start repeating. For instance:
- If `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the remainders will be:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1` (repeats)
  - `5 % 5 = 0` (repeats)
  - `5 % 6 = 5`
  - `5 % 7 = 5`
  - `5 % 8 = 5`
  - `5 % 9 = 5`
  - `5 % 10 = 5`
  
Thus, when `k` is greater than `n`, the program will incorrectly state that remainders are distinct when they are not.

### Conclusion:
Since there exists a case where the program does not work correctly (e.g., `n = 5`, `k = 10`), the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
