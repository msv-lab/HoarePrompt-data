Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute k times, calculating the remainder of n divided by each integer from 1 to k. The set seen will contain all unique remainders calculated during the loop. If any remainder is repeated, the program will print 'No' and exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and seen remains an empty set.**
