The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. This means that the current state of the variables does not change, but the program execution stops. Therefore, the output state reflects that the function prints 'No' before exiting.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, the function prints 'No' and the program exits.**
