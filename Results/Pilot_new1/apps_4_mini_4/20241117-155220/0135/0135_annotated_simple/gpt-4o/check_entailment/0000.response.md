To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and check if it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to check if the remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to ensure that there are no two integers `i` and `j` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Program Logic
1. **Immediate Return for k >= n**:
   - The program first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If this condition is true, it returns `'No'`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `n mod k` will always be `n` (if `k > n`) or `0` (if `k = n`), which will lead to non-distinct remainders.

2. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - If `k` is less than `n`, the program initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` and iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating `n mod i` for each `i`.
   - It checks if the calculated remainder has already been seen (i.e., is in the `seen_remainders` set). If it has, it returns `'No'`, indicating that the remainders are not distinct.
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it adds it to the set.

3. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the program returns `'Yes'`, indicating that all remainders are distinct.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Case where k = 1**:
   - For any `n`, `n mod 1` will always be `0`. Thus, it should return `'No'` because the only remainder is not distinct.

2. **Case where n = 1 and k = 1**:
   - Here, `1 mod 1` is `0`, and it should return `'No'`.

3. **Case where k < n**:
   - For `k = 2` and `n = 3`, we have:
     - `3 mod 1 = 0`
     - `3 mod 2 = 1`
   - The remainders are distinct, so it should return `'Yes'`.

4. **Case where k = n**:
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, we have:
     - `4 mod 1 = 0`
     - `4 mod 2 = 0`
     - `4 mod 3 = 1`
     - `4 mod 4 = 0`
   - Here, the result should be `'No'` since `0` is repeated.

5. **Case where n is much larger than k**:
   - For `n = 10^18` and `k = 10`, the program computes:
     - `10^18 mod 1 = 0`
     - `10^18 mod 2 = 0`
     - `10^18 mod 3 = 1`
     - `10^18 mod 4 = 2`
     - `10^18 mod 5 = 0`
     - `10^18 mod 6 = 4`
     - `10^18 mod 7 = 3`
     - `10^18 mod 8 = 2`
     - `10^18 mod 9 = 1`
     - `10^18 mod 10 = 0`
   - This will yield multiple duplicates, resulting in a return of `'No'`.

### Conclusion
The program logic correctly checks the distinctness of remainders for all specified cases. However, the program does not handle the case of `k = 1` correctly, as it should return `'No'` for `k = 1` but does not check for this specifically.

Thus, the program fails in some edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
