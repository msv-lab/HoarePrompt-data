According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k + 1`. Given that `n` is not directly relevant to the execution of the loop, we only need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, it can take any valid value within this range.

To summarize, for the loop to execute, we need `k` to be at least 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
