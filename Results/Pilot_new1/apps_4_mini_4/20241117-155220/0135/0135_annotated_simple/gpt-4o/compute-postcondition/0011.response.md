According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. The value of `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, it is not certain whether it is greater than or equal to 3, so we need to adjust that state as well.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
