The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, but the specific values of those integers are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now sorted, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers**
