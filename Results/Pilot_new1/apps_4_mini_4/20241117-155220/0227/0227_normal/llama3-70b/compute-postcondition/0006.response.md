The value of `m` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `m` will be 2. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1**
