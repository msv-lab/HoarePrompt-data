Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, making `m` at least 3. Since `n` remains at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, and `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[1]`), the state of `m` reflects that the loop did not execute, and `can_form` remains unchanged. If `can_form` were True, `m` would not change, but since it is False, `m` is incremented.***
