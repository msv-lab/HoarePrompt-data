Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially, but if the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or statement. Regardless, `m` remains at least 3, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[1]`), and `i` is 2. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False.***
