The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` is at least 3, after the execution, `m` will be at least 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is False, `m` is at least 4, `assigned` contains at least one element, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is at least 4, `assigned` contains at least one element, and `i` is 2**
