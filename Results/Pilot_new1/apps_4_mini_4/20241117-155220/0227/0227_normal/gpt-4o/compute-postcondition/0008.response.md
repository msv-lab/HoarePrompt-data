The value of `can_form` is set to `True`. The previous state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is a[0], and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the list `assigned`.
