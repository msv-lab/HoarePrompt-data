The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, but it is already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `can_form` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least four elements, `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`**
