The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least four elements, and `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
