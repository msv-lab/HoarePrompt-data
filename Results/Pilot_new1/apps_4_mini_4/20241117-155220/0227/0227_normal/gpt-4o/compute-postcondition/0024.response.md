The code `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `a` to the set `assigned`. Since `i` is 1, the element being added is `a[1]`. The state of `can_form`, `m`, and `i` does not change as this line only affects the `assigned` set.

Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[1]`, `m` is at least 2, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[1]`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
