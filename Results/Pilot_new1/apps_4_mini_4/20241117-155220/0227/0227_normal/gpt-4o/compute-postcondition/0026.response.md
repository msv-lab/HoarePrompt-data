The value of `can_form` is assigned `False`, which is its current value. Since `can_form` was already `False`, there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[1]`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[1]`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
