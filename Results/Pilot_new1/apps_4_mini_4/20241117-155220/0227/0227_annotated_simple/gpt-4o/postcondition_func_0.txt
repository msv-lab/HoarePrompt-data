The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It counts and returns the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the differences of previously assigned elements. If `n` is 1, it will always return 1, as there are no other elements to form a difference with. If `n` is greater than 1, the function iterates through the sorted list and checks for each element if it can be formed by the difference of any two previously assigned elements. The return value `m` represents the count of such elements that cannot be formed from the differences.
