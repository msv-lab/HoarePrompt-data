Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (which is `a[0]`) exists in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False and no changes are made to the other variables.***
