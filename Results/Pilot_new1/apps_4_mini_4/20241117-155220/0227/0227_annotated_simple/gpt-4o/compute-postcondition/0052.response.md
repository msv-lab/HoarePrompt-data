Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, while `m` and `n` remain unchanged, `assigned` contains at least one element, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `m` and `n` stay unchanged, `assigned` still has at least one element, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
