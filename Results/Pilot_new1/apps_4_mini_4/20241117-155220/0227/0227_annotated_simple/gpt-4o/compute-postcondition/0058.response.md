The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`, which indicates that the state has changed. The other variables (`m`, `n`, `assigned`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while the others remain as they were.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `assigned` contains at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `assigned`**
