The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `assigned` contains at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
