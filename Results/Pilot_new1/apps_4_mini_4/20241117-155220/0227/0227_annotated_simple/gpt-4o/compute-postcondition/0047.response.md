The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `can_form` is not specified, but it is now explicitly set to `False`. The other variables (`m`, `n`, `assigned`, and `i`) remain unchanged, as stated in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while noting that the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `assigned` now includes `a[i + 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
