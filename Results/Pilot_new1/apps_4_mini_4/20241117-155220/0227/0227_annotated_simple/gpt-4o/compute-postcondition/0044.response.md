Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether a valid element `x` exists in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, while `n` and `i` remain unchanged. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and both `n` and `i` also remain unchanged. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False, and thus `m` is incremented by 1.***
