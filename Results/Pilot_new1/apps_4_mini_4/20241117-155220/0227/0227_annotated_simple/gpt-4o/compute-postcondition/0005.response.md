The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of the unaffected variables.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, and `can_form` is False**.
