The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer based on user input and `a` is currently uninitialized. After executing the code, `a` will contain `n` distinct integers provided by the user input, where each integer is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^9\). Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct integers where 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9 based on user input**
