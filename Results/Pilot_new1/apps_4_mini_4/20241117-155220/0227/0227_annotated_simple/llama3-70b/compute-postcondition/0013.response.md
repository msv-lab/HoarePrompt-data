Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, and `m` is either 3 or 4. If the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n-1]`) is not equal to twice the second-to-last element (i.e., `a[n-2]`), then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being 4. Otherwise, `m` remains 3.***
