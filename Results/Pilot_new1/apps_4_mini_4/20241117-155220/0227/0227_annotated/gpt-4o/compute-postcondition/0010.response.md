Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found, `can_form` remains False, indicating that no valid combination was found.***
