The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `m` is 1, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop.
