Postcondition: ***`can_form` remains True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned` after the current one. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` may remain unchanged, and the program continues without breaking.***
