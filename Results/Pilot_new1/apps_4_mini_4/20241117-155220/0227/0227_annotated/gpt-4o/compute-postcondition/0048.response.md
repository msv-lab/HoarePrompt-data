According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` variable. The loop will execute if `assigned` contains at least one element. Given that `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, it implies that there is at least one element in `assigned`, so the loop can execute. 

Additionally, the variable `x` will take on the value of the elements in `assigned` during each iteration. Since `i` is either 1 or 2, it indicates that it could be in the first or second iteration. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `assigned` contains elements, and `x` should be the first element in `assigned` during the first iteration.

State: **`can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[n-1]`**
