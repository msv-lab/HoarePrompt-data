According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. The loop will execute again if there are more elements in `assigned` after the current `x`.

Since `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more element in `assigned` after `x`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `x` should be the next element in `assigned` after the current one. If `assigned` has at least one more element after `x`, then `x` would be the next element, and `i` would be incremented accordingly.

State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned` after the current one**.
