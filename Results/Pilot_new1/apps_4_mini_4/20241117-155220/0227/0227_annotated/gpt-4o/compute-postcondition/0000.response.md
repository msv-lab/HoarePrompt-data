The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, and since the integers are distinct, sorting will rearrange them without any duplicates. The specific values of the integers in `a` are not provided, but we know they will be rearranged in increasing order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as sorting does not affect the number of elements in the list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers**
