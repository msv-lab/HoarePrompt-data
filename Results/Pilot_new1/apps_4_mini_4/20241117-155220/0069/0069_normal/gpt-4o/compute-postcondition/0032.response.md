According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of `prefix_balances`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. For the loop to execute one more time, `prefix_balances` must contain at least 2 elements, and `b` must be updated to the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` is 1**
