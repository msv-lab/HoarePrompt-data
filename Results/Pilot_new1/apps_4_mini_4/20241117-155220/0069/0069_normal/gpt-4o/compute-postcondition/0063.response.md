Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and `balance` is not equal to 0. This indicates that there is a cumulative imbalance in the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s` after processing, and if `n` is at least 1, the list contains the cumulative balance values for each index from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros.***
