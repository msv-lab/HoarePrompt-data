Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` is appended to `results`; otherwise, `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated as the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is non-negative and divisible by `balance`, and this count is appended to `results`. In all cases, `results` reflects the appropriate value based on the conditions evaluated.***
