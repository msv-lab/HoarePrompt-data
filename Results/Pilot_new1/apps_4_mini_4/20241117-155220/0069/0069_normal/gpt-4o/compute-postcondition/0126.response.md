The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it processes multiple test cases based on the constraints provided. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `x`, followed by a binary string `s` of length `n`. The function evaluates these inputs according to the specified logic. 

The output of the function is determined by the conditions defined for each test case, which may involve calculations or evaluations based on the values of `n`, `x`, and the binary string `s`. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases consisting of two integers `n` and `x`, followed by a binary string `s` of length `n`, and produces outputs based on the evaluations of these inputs.**
