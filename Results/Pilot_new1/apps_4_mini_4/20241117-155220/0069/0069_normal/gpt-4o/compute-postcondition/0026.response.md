Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where each character contributes either +1 (if '0') or -1 (if '1'). After the loop executes, `balance` is not equal to 0, indicating that there is a net contribution from the characters in `s`.***
