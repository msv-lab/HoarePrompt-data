Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to 0, indicating that the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` is balanced. If `n` is at least 1, then `prefix_balances[i]` reflects the cumulative balance for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, with `prefix_balances[n]` being the final balance. If `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with zeros.***
