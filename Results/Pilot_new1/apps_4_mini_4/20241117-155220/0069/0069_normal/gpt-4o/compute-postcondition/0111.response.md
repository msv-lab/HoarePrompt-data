Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums with at least 1 element, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `n` is 1, `T` is greater than 0, and `count` remains unchanged at 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.***
