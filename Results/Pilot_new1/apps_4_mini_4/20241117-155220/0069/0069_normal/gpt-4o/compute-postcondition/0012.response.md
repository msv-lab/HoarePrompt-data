According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1 and will increment with each iteration. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is initialized to a list of size `n + 1`, which is valid as long as `n` is non-negative.

For the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized to all zeros**
