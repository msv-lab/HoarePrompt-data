Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and it is not the case that `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` (meaning either `cnt0 - cnt1` is zero or `x - balance` is not divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`).***
