The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. The values of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.**
