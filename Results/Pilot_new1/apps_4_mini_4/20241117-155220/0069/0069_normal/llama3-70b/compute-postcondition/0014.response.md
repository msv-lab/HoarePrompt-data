Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for the number of complete cycles needed to adjust the balance towards `x`. This ensures all scenarios are handled, including edge cases where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, leading to division by zero.***
