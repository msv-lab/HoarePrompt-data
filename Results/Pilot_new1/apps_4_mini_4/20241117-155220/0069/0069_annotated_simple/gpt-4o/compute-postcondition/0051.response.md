According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop can execute again if `i` is still less than `n + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The variable `prefix_balances` does not need any adjustments since its length is already `n + 1` and is initialized correctly. 

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements as 0; `i` is 2; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 (if `s[0]` is '0') or -1 (if `s[0]` is not '0')**
