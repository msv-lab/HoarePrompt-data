Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. If `x` is not present, `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. This ensures that all possible values of `x` in relation to `prefix_balances` are accounted for, including cases where `n` is 0 (resulting in no loop execution) and where `balance` could potentially be zero or non-zero.***
