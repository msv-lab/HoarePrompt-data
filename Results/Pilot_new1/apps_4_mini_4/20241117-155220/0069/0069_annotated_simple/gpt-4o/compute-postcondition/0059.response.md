The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `-1` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, and `-1` is appended to `results`**.
