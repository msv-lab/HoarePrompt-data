Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If the value of `x` minus the first element `b` of `prefix_balances` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
