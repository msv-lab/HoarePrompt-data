To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: A string `s` of length `n` consisting of `0`s and `1`s, and an integer `x` representing the desired balance.
2. **Output**: The number of prefixes of the infinite string `t` (which is `s` repeated infinitely) that have a balance equal to `x`. If there are an infinite number of such prefixes, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Balance Calculation**: The program computes the balance of string `s` by counting the number of `0`s and `1`s:
   ```python
   balance = s.count('0') - s.count('1')
   ```
2. **Prefix Balances**: It creates a list `prefix_balances` to store the cumulative balance of prefixes of `s`:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)
   ```
3. **Handling Cases**:
   - If `balance` is `0`, it checks if `x` is in `prefix_balances`. If yes, it appends `-1` to the results (indicating infinite solutions). If not, it appends `0` (indicating no valid prefixes).
   - If `balance` is not `0`, it counts how many prefixes can achieve the balance `x`:
     ```python
     count = 0
     for b in prefix_balances:
         if (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0:
             count += 1
     ```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Infinite Solutions Check**: The condition for infinite solutions is only checking if `x` is in `prefix_balances`. This may not cover all scenarios where `balance` is `0` and there are multiple valid prefixes, especially if `x` can be achieved in multiple ways due to the repeated nature of `t`.
2. **Prefix Count Logic**: The logic for counting valid prefixes when `balance` is not `0` checks for non-negative results of `(x - b) // balance`. However, it does not consider if `x` can be negative or if the required balance can be achieved with the infinite nature of `t`.

### Test Case Consideration:
- **Case with Infinite Valid Prefixes**: If `s` is `0101` and `x` is `0`, the balance is `0` and there are infinitely many prefixes, but the program might incorrectly return `0` instead of `-1` if `x` is not in `prefix_balances` but still can be achieved infinitely.
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, particularly when checking for infinite solutions. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
