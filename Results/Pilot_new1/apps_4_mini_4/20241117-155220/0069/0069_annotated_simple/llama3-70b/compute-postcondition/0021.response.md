The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. It does not change the values of the variables `cnt0`, `cnt1`, or `balance`. Therefore, the output state remains the same for these variables.

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1**
