Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is valid if `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero or `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0`. Edge cases include scenarios where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a potential division by zero, which is addressed by the conditions in the else part.***
