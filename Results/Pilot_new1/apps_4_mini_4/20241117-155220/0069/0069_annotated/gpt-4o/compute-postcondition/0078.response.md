Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums of '0's and '1's up to index `n`, `balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, and `x` is an integer. If `balance` is equal to 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain at least three elements including two `-1`s and one additional `-1`. If `x` is not found, `results` will contain at least two elements including one `-1` and one `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and `results` is updated to include `count`. In both cases, `T` remains greater than the current iteration count, and `index` is increased by 3. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
