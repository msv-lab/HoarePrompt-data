Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, and `index` is increased by 3. If `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, otherwise `count` remains 0.***
