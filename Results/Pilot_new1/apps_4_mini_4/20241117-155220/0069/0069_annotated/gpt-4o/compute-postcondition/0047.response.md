To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet in relation to the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state indicates that `s` has been assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The specific value of `s` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact counts of '0's and '1's in `s`.
2. The line of code `balance = s.count('0') - s.count('1')` will compute the difference between the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.
3. The variable `balance` will then be updated based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`.

Since we do not have the specific string value for `s`, we cannot provide a concrete numerical value for `balance`, but we can express its relationship to the counts of '0's and '1's.

Output State: **`balance` is the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `index` is increased by 3**
