Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative differences for the first `n` characters of `s`, where `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times updating `prefix_balances`; if `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.***
