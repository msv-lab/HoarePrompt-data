Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `index` is increased by 3, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
