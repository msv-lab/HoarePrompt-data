The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `data[index + 1]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `x`. The initial state indicates that `balance` is 0, `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, and `T` is greater than the current iteration count. The assignment of `x` does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1, and `T` is greater than the current iteration count.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1, and `T` is greater than the current iteration count**
