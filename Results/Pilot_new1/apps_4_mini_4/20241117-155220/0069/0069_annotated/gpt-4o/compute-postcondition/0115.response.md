Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative differences for the first `n` characters of `s`, and `balance` is an integer. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and this count is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.***
