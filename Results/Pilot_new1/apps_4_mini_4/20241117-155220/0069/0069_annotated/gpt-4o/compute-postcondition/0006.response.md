The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` is 1, so `n` will be the integer representation of the string located at the second position (index 1) of the `data` list. The initial state does not provide the specific content of `data`, but it indicates that `data` is a list of strings. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `n` based on the value at `data[1]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value of `data[1]**.
