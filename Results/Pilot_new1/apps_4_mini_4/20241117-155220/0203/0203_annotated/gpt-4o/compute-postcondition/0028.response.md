The value of `d_index` is assigned the value of `d_queue.pop(0)`, which removes and returns the first element of `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` will change to reflect that the first element has been removed, but the specific value of the first element is not provided. The values of `r_index` and `r_queue` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now missing its first element, `r_index` is an integer, and `r_queue` is not empty.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now missing its first element, `r_index` is an integer, `r_queue` is not empty**
