The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The variable `r_queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we assume it exists and can hold values. The previous value of `i` is 2, so after execution, `r_queue` will contain the value 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; and `r_queue` now includes the value 2.
