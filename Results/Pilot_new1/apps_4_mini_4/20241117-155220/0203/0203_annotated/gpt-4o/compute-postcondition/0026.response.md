Postcondition: ***`d_index` and `r_index` are integers. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is modified to include the element `d_index + n` after removing its first element. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` is modified to include the element `r_index + n` after removing its first element. In either case, both queues are updated by removing their respective first elements.***
