The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` is an unknown integer. The previous state of `r_queue` is not specified, but we know that `r_queue` will now have an additional element.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d_index` is the second element of the original `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`; `r_queue` now has an additional element which is `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_index` is the second element of the original `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`; `r_queue` now has an additional element which is `r_index + n`**
