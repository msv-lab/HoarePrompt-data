The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified logic involving the characters in the `fractions` string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
