According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. The loop will execute again as long as there are more characters in the string. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `fractions` is a non-empty string, and the first character has been processed. 

Since we have processed the first character of `fractions`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now at the second character of the string. The loop will continue if there are more characters after the first one. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `fractions` must have at least 2 characters remaining.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string with at least 2 characters, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and the current character being processed is the second character of `fractions`.**
