Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D'. If `fractions` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once, processing each character in `fractions`.**
