According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `fractions`. The loop will continue as long as there are characters left to process in `fractions`. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` has at least 2 characters, and since we are processing one character at a time, we need to ensure that there is at least one character remaining in `fractions` for the loop to execute one more time.

If we denote the length of `fractions` as `len(fractions)`, and since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), we can say that `n` is at least 2 at the start of the loop. After processing one character, the remaining characters will be `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3 (to ensure at least one character remains).

The current character being processed does not affect the count of `depublicans` and `remocrats` unless it is 'D' or not, but it does not change the requirement for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is at least one character remaining in `fractions` after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `fractions` is a string with at least 2 characters**
