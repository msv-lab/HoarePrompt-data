The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. Previously, `remocrats` was 0, so after execution, `remocrats` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, `depublicans`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string with at least 2 characters, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 1, and the current character being processed is the second character of `fractions`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string with at least 2 characters, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 1, and the current character being processed is the second character of `fractions`**
