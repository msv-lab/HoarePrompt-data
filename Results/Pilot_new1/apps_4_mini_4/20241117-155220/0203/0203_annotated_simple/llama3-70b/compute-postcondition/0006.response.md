The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, and `fraction` is equal to 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, and `fraction` is equal to 'D'**
