The code appends the value of `i` to `r_queue`. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n`, which is an input integer between 1 and 200,000. Since `v` is undefined, it does not affect the output state. The output state will reflect the current values of `n`, `i`, and the change in `r_queue` after appending `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is `n`, and `r_queue` now contains `n`**
