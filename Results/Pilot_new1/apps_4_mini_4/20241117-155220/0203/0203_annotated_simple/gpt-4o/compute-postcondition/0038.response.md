Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` have one less element each. If `d_index` (the popped element from `d_queue`) is less than `r_index` (the popped element from `r_queue`), then `d_queue` has one more element, which is `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` now includes `r_index + n`, maintaining the condition that `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue` and `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`.***
