The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, so the value appended to `d_queue` will be 0. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is now [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is now [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is 'D'**
