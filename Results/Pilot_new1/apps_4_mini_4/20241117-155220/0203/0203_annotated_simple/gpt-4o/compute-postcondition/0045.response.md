Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed, and `r_queue` may be empty or non-empty. If `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed, and `r_queue` can contain any remaining elements. In either case, both queues may have fewer elements than initially, depending on prior operations, and if `votes` is an empty string (i.e., `n` is 0), both queues remain empty.***
