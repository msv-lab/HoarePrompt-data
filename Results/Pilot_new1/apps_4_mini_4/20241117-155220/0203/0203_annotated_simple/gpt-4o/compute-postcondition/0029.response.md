The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the element that is popped from `r_queue` at index 0. Since `r_queue` has at least one element, the popping operation will successfully remove the first element from `r_queue` and assign it to `r_index`. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`**
