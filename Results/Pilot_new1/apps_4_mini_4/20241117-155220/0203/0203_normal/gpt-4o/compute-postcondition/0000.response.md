The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input string and `int()` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `votes` remains a string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`**
