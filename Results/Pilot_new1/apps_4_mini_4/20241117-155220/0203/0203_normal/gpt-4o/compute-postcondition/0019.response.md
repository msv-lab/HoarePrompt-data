Output State: **`d_queue` contains indices of 'D' votes, `r_queue` contains indices of non-'D' votes. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes exactly `n` times, processing each character in `votes`. After execution, `i` will equal `n - 1` at the last iteration, and `v` will be the character at that index.**
