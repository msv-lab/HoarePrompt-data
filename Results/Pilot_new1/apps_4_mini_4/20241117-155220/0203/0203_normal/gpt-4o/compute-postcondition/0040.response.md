Output State: **If `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty and the loop does not execute. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes while both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty. After execution, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are modified based on the comparisons of the indices: if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` will have one more element (`d_index + n`) and `r_queue` will have one less element; if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` will have one more element (`r_index + n`) and `d_queue` will have one less element. The loop will continue until at least one of the queues becomes empty. At the end of the loop, `i` will be the last index processed (which is `n - 1`), and `v` will be the character at that index in `votes`. If either queue is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged.**
