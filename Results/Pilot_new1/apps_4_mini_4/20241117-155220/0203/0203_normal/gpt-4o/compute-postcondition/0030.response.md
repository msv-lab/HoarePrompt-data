The code appends the value `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` initially has one less element, the operation will add a new element based on the current value of `d_index` and `n`. The variables `d_index` and `n` remain unchanged, and the state of `r_queue` and `r_index` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one more element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
