Postcondition: ***If `votes` is an empty string, then both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged and empty, and 'R' is printed. If `d_queue` is non-empty, the loop executes while both queues are non-empty, modifying `d_queue` and `r_queue` based on the comparisons of `d_index` and `r_index`. At the end of the loop, `i` will be `n - 1`, and `v` will be the character at index `i` in `votes`, with 'D' printed. If both queues are empty initially, the loop does not execute, and 'R' is printed.***
