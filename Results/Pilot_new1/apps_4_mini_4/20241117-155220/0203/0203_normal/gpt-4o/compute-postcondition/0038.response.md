Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` have been modified based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one more element (with `d_index + n` appended), while `r_queue` remains one element less. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has one more element (with `r_index + n` appended), while `d_queue` has one less element. In either case, `r_index` retains the value of the first element that was in `r_queue` before the operation. This ensures that all potential scenarios regarding the relationship between `d_index` and `r_index` are covered.***
