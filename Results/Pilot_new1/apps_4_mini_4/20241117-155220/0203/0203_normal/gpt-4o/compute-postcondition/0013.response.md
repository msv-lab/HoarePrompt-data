Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. If the character `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the index `i` (which is `n - 1`). If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` includes the index `i`, while `d_queue` remains unchanged. In both cases, `i` is equal to `n - 1`.***
