The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` has at least one element, this operation will successfully retrieve and remove that first element. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The `d_index` also remains the same as it is not impacted by the pop operation on `r_queue`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` now has one less element, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`**.
