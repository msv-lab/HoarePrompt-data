According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, it ensures that the `fractions` string will have at least one character. Therefore, the loop can execute as long as `fractions` is not empty.

At the start of the loop, the `fraction` variable will take on the value of each character in the `fractions` string, starting with the first character. Thus, before the loop starts, we can set `fraction` to the first character of the `fractions` string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
