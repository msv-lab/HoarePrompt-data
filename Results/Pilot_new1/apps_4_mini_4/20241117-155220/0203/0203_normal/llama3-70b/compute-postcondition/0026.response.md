Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (which is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' (depublicans) is greater than the count of 'R' (remocrats), it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0, but it is expected that `n` will always be a positive integer as per the problem statement.**
