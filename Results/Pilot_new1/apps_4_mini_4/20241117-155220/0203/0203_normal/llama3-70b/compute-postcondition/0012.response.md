The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `fraction`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 and `n` is greater than 1; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the next character in the string; `remocrats` is increased by 1.
