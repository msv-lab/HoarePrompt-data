The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 0 to 1. The values of `n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1**
