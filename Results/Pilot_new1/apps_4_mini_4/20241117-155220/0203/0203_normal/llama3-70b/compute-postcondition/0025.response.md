The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 200,000 \), and `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, the output is determined by the contents of the `fractions` string and the value of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string fractions of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
