In the given initial state, `a` is currently `a % b`, and `b` is the previous value of `a`, which is greater than 0. 

1. The line `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment. 
2. The new value of `a` will be assigned the current value of `b`, which is the previous value of `a`.
3. The new value of `b` will be assigned the result of `a % b`, where `a` is currently `a % b` and `b` is the previous value of `a`. 

Since `a` is `a % b`, this means that the new `b` will be `(a % b) % b`, which will effectively be `a % b` since `b` is greater than 0.

Thus, after the execution:
- `a` will take the previous value of `b`.
- `b` will take the value of `a % b`.

The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`a` is now the previous value of `b`, `b` is now `a % b`**
