The expression `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified range. However, without specific values for `n` and `k`, we can only describe the relationship.

`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` integers. The variable `n` remains unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2**
