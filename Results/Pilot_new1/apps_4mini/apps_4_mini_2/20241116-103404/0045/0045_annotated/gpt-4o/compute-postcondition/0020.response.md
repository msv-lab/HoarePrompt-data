Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is updated at index `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `k - 3`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues executing without breaking.***
