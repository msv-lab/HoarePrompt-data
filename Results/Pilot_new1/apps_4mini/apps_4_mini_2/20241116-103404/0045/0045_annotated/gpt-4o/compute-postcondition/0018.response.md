According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 2`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 3`. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to `k - 3`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `k - 3` will be non-negative as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted because the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`) do not affect the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is updated at index `k - 2`, and `i` is equal to `k - 3`**
