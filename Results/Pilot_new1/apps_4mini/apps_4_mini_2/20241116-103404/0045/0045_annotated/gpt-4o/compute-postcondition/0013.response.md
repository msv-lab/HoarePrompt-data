According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. The loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 2`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is not less than `0`.

The other states, such as `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence`, do not need to be adjusted because they are not affected by the loop iteration directly.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, `i` is equal to `k - 2`**
