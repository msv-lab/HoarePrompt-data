The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to `0`, `sequence` is `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, and `i` is equal to `k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
