The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if `min_sum` (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that `n` is insufficient to meet the minimum sum requirement. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, indicating that `n` is sufficient to meet or exceed `min_sum`.

In Case 2, if a certain condition regarding a remainder is satisfied (greater than 0), the function returns a modified sequence. If this condition is not satisfied, it returns the unchanged sequence.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on the comparison of `n` with the calculated `min_sum`, it either returns -1 or indicates sufficiency. Additionally, it may return a modified or unchanged sequence based on another condition related to a remainder. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It returns -1 if the calculated minimum sum is greater than `n`. If `n` is sufficient, it does not return a value. Additionally, it returns a modified sequence if a certain condition regarding a remainder is met; otherwise, it returns the unchanged sequence.**
