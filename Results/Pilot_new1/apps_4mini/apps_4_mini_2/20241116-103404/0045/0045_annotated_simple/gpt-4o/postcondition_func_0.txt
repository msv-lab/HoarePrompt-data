The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` consecutive integers starting from 1. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. If `n` is sufficient, it calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n` and constructs a sequence of `k` integers that sum to `n`. The sequence is initialized with multiples of the base integers and then adjusted by incrementing the last elements based on any remaining value after distributing the base sum. The function always returns the modified sequence, even if no adjustments were made.
