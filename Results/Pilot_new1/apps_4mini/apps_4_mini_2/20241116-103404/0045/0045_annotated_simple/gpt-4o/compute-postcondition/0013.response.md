According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be adjusted to be `k - 2`, which is one less than its current value of `k - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1` (the last value it took), and for the loop to run again, `i` needs to be `k - 2`. The other states (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence[i]`) do not need to be adjusted since they do not change due to the nature of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 (where `i` is now `k - 2`)**
