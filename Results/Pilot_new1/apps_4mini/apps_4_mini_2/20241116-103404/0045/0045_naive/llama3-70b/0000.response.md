To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires creating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers that sum up to `n` and have a maximal greatest common divisor (GCD). If such a sequence is not possible, the program should return `-1`.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Strictly Increasing Sequence**: The sequence must consist of strictly increasing numbers.
2. **Sum Equals n**: The sum of the sequence must equal `n`.
3. **GCD Maximization**: The GCD of the sequence should be maximized.
4. **Edge Case**: If `n < k`, it's impossible to create such a sequence, and the program should return `-1`.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct.
2. The program initializes an empty list `seq` to store the sequence.
3. It then tries to construct the sequence by adding numbers from `1` to `k` while ensuring that `n` is still sufficient to cover the sum.
4. If it successfully constructs a sequence of length `k`, it prints the sequence; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
- The sequence generated (`1, 2, ..., k`) is indeed strictly increasing and sums to `k * (k + 1) / 2`. 
- If `n` is less than this sum, the program will correctly return `-1`.
- However, the program does not consider the GCD maximization. The sequence it constructs does not necessarily have the maximal GCD.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where `n = 8` and `k = 2`. The program would produce `1 2`, which sums to `3`. The maximal GCD for a valid sequence that sums to `8` could be `2`, leading to a valid sequence such as `2 6`, which is strictly increasing and sums to `8`. 

The program fails to account for the requirement of maximizing the GCD. It only produces the first `k` positive integers, which may not yield the optimal solution.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the requirement of maximizing the GCD correctly and can produce incorrect results for valid inputs, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
