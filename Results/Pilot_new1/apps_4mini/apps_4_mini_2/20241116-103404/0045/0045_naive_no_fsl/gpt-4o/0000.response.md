To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and identify if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Constraints**: The function takes two integers `n` (the sum of the sequence) and `k` (the number of elements in the sequence).
2. **Output Requirements**: 
   - If it's impossible to create such a sequence, return `-1`.
   - If it is possible, return a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and has the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Code Analysis:
- The minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing positive integers is calculated using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` (minimum sum) is greater than `n`, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- The program calculates a base value `d` by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, which is intended to scale the sequence.
- It constructs a sequence of the first `k` positive integers scaled by `d`.
- The program then attempts to distribute any remaining value (`remainder`) across the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Strictly Increasing Requirement**: The code ensures the sequence is strictly increasing by starting with `d * (i + 1)`. However, when distributing the `remainder`, if it adds `1` to the last element multiple times, it could potentially violate the strictly increasing condition if not handled correctly.
2. **GCD Maximization**: The program aims to maximize the GCD by scaling the sequence with `d`. However, if `n` is not a multiple of `min_sum`, the distribution of the remainder could lead to a sequence that does not maximize the GCD.

### Edge Cases:
- Consider the case where `n = 7` and `k = 3`. The minimum sum required is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, which is less than `n`. The program would calculate `d = 7 // 6 = 1`, leading to the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` initially. The remainder is `1`, which would be added to the last element, resulting in `[1, 2, 4]`, which is not strictly increasing.
- For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is again `6`. The program would yield a sequence of `[1, 2, 3]` with a `remainder` of `3`, which could lead to `[1, 2, 6]`, also violating the strictly increasing condition.

### Conclusion:
The program does not consistently ensure the output is a strictly increasing sequence while also maximizing the GCD. Therefore, it fails for certain inputs as outlined in the potential issues.

Correctness: **False**
