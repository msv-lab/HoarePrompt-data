The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is `k - 1`, this means the last element of the `sequence` list is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 1`.
