To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the provided information and the loop structure.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):`, which means it will iterate from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. 
2. The loop variable `i` starts at `k - 1` and decrements by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `-1`, at which point the loop will terminate.
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 2` for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect this.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, `sequence`) do not need to be adjusted since they do not affect the loop's execution in this context. The state of `i` is the only one that needs to change.

Thus, the adjusted state for the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -1, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`**
