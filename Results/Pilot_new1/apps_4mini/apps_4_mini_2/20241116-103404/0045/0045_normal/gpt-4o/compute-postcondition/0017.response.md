The code decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is -1, so after executing the statement, `remainder` becomes -2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, `i`, and `sequence[i]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
