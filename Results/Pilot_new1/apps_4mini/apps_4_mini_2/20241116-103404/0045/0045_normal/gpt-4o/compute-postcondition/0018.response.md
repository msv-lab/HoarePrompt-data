According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be decremented to `k - 1` in the next iteration. This means `i` will be `k - 2` at the start of the next iteration, which is already the case.

The loop condition checks if `i` is within the range from `k - 1` down to `0`. Since `i` is currently `k - 2`, it will be decremented to `k - 3` in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need `i` to be adjusted to `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` should be the element at index `k - 2` in the list.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` are already defined correctly for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is the element at index `k - 2` in the list**
