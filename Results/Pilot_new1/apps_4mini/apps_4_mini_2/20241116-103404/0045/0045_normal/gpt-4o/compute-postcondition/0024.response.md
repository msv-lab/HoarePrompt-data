Output State: **`if remainder is greater than 0 then sequence will have the last k elements incremented by the number of times the loop executes, remainder will be negative of the number of times the loop executes, and i will be the index of the last element modified. If remainder is 0 before the loop starts, then sequence remains as [d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k], remainder is unchanged, and the loop does not execute.`**
