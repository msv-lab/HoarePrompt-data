Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: [d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k], and `i` is `k - 1`. If `remainder` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
