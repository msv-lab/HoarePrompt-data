To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have the maximal greatest common divisor (GCD). If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The code calculates the minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing numbers starting from 1 using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct, as the smallest such sequence is `1, 2, ..., k`.

2. **Feasibility Check**: It checks if `min_sum > n`. If true, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to create such a sequence.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The code computes `d = n // min_sum`, which represents how many times the minimum sum can fit into `n`. This is intended to maximize the GCD of the sequence.

4. **Sequence Generation**: The sequence is generated as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`. This ensures that the sequence starts from `d` and is strictly increasing.

5. **Remainder Adjustment**: The code adjusts the sequence by distributing the remainder (`n - d * min_sum`) across the elements of the sequence, which is done by incrementing the last elements.

### Edge Cases to Consider
- If `k = 1`, the only valid sequence is `[n]`, provided `n > 0`.
- If `n < min_sum`, the function correctly returns `-1`.
- If `n` is exactly equal to `min_sum`, the function should return the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]`.
- The program must ensure that the final sequence remains strictly increasing and that the GCD is maximized.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that the function generates a sequence of `k` integers, checks the minimum sum, and adjusts for any remainder. This aligns with the code's functionality, as it describes the process of generating the sequence and adjusting it based on the remainder.

### Conclusion
Upon reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The program covers the necessary edge cases and correctly generates the sequence or returns `-1` when appropriate.

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, generating a valid strictly increasing sequence of `k` integers that sum to `n` with a maximal GCD, or returning `-1` when such a sequence cannot be formed.
