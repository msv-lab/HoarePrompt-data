Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, allowing for further processing in the program.***
