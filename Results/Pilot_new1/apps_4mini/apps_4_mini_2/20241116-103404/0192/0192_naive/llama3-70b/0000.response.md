Correctness: **False**.

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not account for the necessary operations to modify the triangle sides while maintaining the properties of a non-degenerate triangle. The problem requires a sequence of modifications to reach the target side length while ensuring that the triangle remains valid at all times.

For instance, consider the input case:
```
x = 6, y = 3
```
The expected output is `4`, as it takes four operations to transform `(6, 6, 6)` into `(3, 3, 3)`. However, the program would output `abs(6 - 3)`, which is `3`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the intermediate steps required to maintain the triangle's properties during the transformation.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
