Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, calculates the value of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, and prints the result. It does not return any value. The calculation effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. The function assumes that the input values satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. **
