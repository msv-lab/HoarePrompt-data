The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates with two integers `x` and `y`, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. However, since these parameters are not explicitly passed to the function, the function likely utilizes them from a different context or source.

The function does not return any specific output description based on the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact nature of the output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specified return value based on the given constraints.**
