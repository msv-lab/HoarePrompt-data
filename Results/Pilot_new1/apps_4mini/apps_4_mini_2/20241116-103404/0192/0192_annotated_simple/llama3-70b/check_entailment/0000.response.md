Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints that value. However, this logic is incorrect based on the problem description.

The problem states that Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to modify it to side length `y` while ensuring that the triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle (which requires that the lengths of the sides remain positive). The program simply outputs the difference `|x - y|`, which does not account for the specific operations required to transform the triangle while maintaining its properties.

For example, consider the input `6 3`. The program would output `3`, which is incorrect because the actual minimum number of operations needed is `4`, as described in the problem. The correct sequence of operations would involve multiple steps of reducing the sides while ensuring the triangle remains valid.

Thus, since the program fails to provide the correct number of operations needed in various cases, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
