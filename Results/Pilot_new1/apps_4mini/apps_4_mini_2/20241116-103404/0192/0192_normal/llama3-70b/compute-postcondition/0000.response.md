The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided through `input().split()` which is then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The range constraints indicate that `y` is an integer such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. However, the exact values of `x` and `y` after the execution depend on the specific input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`**
