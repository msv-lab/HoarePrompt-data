The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. After executing the function body, the specific output or behavior based on these parameters has not been provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers `x` and `y` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers satisfying the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
