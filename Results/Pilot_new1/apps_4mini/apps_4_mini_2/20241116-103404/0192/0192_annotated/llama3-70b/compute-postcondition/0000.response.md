The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input received through `map(int, input().split())`. Since `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the output state will reflect the new values of `x` and `y` as integers based on the input. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer greater than `y` and less than or equal to 100,000; `y` is an input integer such that `3 ≤ y < x`**
