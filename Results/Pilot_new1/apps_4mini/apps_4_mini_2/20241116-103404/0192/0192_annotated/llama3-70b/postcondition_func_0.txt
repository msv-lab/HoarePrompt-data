The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. It does not return any value. The function assumes that `x` and `y` are provided in the constraints where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but it does not handle cases where this assumption is violated, nor does it validate the input.
