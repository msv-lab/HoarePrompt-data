To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are \(2^n\) days in a year.
2. We want to find the probability that at least two out of \(k\) people share a birthday.
3. The output should be given as an irreducible fraction \(\frac{A}{B}\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are coprime, and both should be printed modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return (numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3))

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
(A, B) = func_1(n, k)
print(A, B)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Total Days Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\).
2. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**: The numerator is built by multiplying the number of available days for each person, while the denominator is simply \(total\_days^k\). This correctly computes the probability of no two people sharing a birthday.
3. **GCD Reduction**: The program reduces the fraction by calculating the GCD of the numerator and denominator.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Finally, the results are returned modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Edge Cases:
1. **When \(k > 2^n\)**: The code does not handle the case where \(k\) exceeds \(2^n\). In such situations, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday should be 1 (i.e., \(A = 1\) and \(B = 1\)). The current implementation would still compute a fraction that does not represent this scenario accurately.
2. **Very Large Values**: Given the constraints \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), the calculations for \(numerator\) and \(denominator\) can lead to extremely large integers that may not be handled properly in Python without specific considerations for performance and overflow.

### Example Case to Illustrate Incorrectness:
Let's consider the input:
```
1 3
```
Here, \(n = 1\) implies \(2^n = 2\) days, and \(k = 3\) people. The expected output is:
```
1 1
```
However, the current implementation will attempt to compute:
- Numerator: \(2 - 0\) (for person 1) \(\times (2 - 1)\) (for person 2) \(\times (2 - 2)\) (for person 3) = \(2 \times 1 \times 0 = 0\)
- Denominator: \(2^3 = 8\)

The GCD would be \(0\), leading to a division by zero scenario, which is not handled.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the case where \(k > 2^n\) correctly, it leads to incorrect outputs for such scenarios. 

Correctness: **False**
