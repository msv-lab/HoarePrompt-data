To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we will analyze the code, the problem requirements, and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to compute the probability that at least two people out of `k` interviewed in Udayland (which has `2^n` days) share a birthday. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. This is a standard implementation and seems correct.
   
2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - It first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If true, it prints `(1, 1)` since it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the probability of no two people sharing a birthday using the formula for permutations:
     - `numerator` counts the arrangements of `k` people with unique birthdays.
     - `denominator` represents the total possible birthday assignments.
   - Finally, it calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday and reduces the fraction by their GCD before printing.

### Edge Cases:
- The code correctly handles the case where `k > 2^n` by immediately returning `(1, 1)`.
- The code assumes `k` is at least `2`, as stated in the problem description. However, if `k` were to be less than `2`, the logic would not be valid since the problem requires at least two people to check for shared birthdays.

### Output Hints:
The output hints indicate that the function computes the correct fractions and reduces them properly. They also state that the function does not handle cases where `k` is less than `2`, which aligns with the original problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all valid input cases. However, the assumption that `k` will always be at least `2` is a potential edge case that could lead to incorrect behavior if `k` were to be less than `2` in a different context.

Since the problem description explicitly states that \( k \) must be at least \( 2 \), and no other issues arise from the provided code and hints, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
