Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`, and if so, it prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it calculates the probability of selecting `k` items from a total of `2^n` items without shared items, computes the corresponding fractions, and prints them modulo 1000003. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 2, as it assumes `k` is at least 2. **
