According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is ((2^n) % MOD * (2^n - 1)) % MOD, `denominator` is updated to (denominator * total_days) % MOD, `i` is 2**
