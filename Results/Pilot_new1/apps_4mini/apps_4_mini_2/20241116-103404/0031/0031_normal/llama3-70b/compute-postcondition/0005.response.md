The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is `2^n`. Therefore, after execution, `denominator` becomes `1 * (2^n)`, which is `2^n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `total_days`, `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 0**
