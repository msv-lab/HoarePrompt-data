The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It calculates `total_days` as \(2^n\), and then it computes the product of a sequence of integers for both the numerator and the denominator based on the value of `k`. Specifically, if `k` is greater than 0, the numerator becomes the product of values decreasing from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, while the denominator is \(total_days\) raised to the power of `k`. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, both the numerator and denominator are set to 1.

After calculating the numerator and denominator, the function computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the fraction formed by the numerator and denominator. Finally, it returns the values of the reduced numerator and denominator, both taken modulo \(10^6 + 3\). 

The annotations suggest that the function returns only the result of `numerator % 10`, which is incorrect. The function actually returns two values: the reduced numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, computes a reduced fraction based on the number of days calculated from `n` and the value of `k`, and returns the numerator and denominator of this fraction modulo \(10^6 + 3\). **
