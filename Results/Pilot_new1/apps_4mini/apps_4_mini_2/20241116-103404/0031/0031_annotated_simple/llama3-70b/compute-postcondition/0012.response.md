According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2, and `i` needs to be incremented to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is (2^n * (2^n - 1)) * (2^n - 2), `denominator` is 2^(3n), `k` is greater than 2, `i` is 3**
