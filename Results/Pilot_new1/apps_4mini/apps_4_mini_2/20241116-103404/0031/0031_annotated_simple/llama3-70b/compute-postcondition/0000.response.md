The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the value of `total_days` will be \(2^n\), which can be a very large number. The variable `k` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n` and `total_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is `2^n`**
