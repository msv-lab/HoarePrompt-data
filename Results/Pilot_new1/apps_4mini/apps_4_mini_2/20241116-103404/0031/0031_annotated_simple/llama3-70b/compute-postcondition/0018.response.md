The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the result of the expression (numerator % (10). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the result of a modulus operation involving a numerator and the number 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, and returns the result of (numerator % 10).**
