The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints the tuple (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is not greater than `2^n`, the function does not execute any further actions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds `2^n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns; otherwise, it performs no actions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If `k` is not greater than `2^n`, it does not execute any further actions.**
