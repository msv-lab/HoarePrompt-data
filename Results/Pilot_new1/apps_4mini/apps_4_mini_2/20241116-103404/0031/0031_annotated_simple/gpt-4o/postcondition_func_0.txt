The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, the function will return `a` as the GCD immediately without entering the loop. The function handles both positive and negative integers, as well as zero, correctly returning the GCD for all cases.
