The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If so, it prints (1, 1) and returns without further execution. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the function computes the number of ways to select `k` items from a total of `2^n` items without sharing, calculates the corresponding probabilities, and prints the reduced fraction of shared selections over total selections modulo \(10^6 + 3\). However, if `k` is 0, it defaults to returning a fraction of (1, 1) since no selections can be made.
