The code snippet `print(1, 1)` outputs the values `1` and `1`. The initial state of the variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` does not change due to the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the function prints 1, 1**
