The variable `p_shared` is assigned the value of the expression `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are `p_no_shared` (which is equal to `numerator`) and `p_total` (which is equal to `denominator`). The expression calculates `p_total - p_no_shared`, adds `MOD`, and then takes the result modulo `MOD`. 

Since the initial values of `p_no_shared` and `p_total` are not explicitly given, the output state reflects their assignments and the computation for `p_shared`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD**
