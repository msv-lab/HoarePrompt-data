The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The value of `p_total` is derived from the initial state, which is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`. The values of `numerator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_shared`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `B` and the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.**
