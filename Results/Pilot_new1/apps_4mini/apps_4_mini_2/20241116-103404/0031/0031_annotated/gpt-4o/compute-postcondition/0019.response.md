The variable `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. The value of `numerator` is defined as the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003. The other variables `denominator`, `total_days`, and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`; and `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`**.
