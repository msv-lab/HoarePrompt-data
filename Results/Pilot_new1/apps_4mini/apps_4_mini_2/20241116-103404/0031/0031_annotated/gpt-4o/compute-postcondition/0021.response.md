The value of `p_shared` is calculated using the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The previous values of the affected variables are `p_total` (which is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`) and `p_no_shared` (which is assigned the value of `numerator`, the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003). 

The operation modifies the variable `p_shared`, but the values of `numerator` and `denominator` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.**
