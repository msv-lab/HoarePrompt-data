The variable `numerator` is assigned the value of `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`. The current value of `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `i` is 1, so the expression becomes `numerator * (2^n - 1) % MOD`. The value of `numerator` is initially \(2^n \mod 1000003\). Therefore, the new value of `numerator` will be:

\[
\text{new numerator} = (2^n \mod 1000003) * ((2^n) - 1) \mod 1000003
\]

The value of `denominator` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 1. The value of `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `numerator`, while `denominator`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \((2^n \mod 1000003) * ((2^n) - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \(2^n \mod 1000003\), `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
