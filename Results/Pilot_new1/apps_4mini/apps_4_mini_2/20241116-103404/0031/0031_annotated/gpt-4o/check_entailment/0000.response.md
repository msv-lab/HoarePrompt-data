To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
ZS the Coder wants to find the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday among `2^n` days. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where both `A` and `B` are coprime and must be printed modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: 
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. 
   - The annotation states that it returns `k` if `n` is a multiple of `k`, otherwise it returns the GCD of `n` and `k`. 
   - This function seems to be used for simplifying the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The first check in this function is whether `k` is greater than \( 2^n \). If so, it prints `(1, 1)` and exits, which is correct because if there are more people than days, at least two must share a birthday.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to \( 2^n \), the code enters a loop to calculate the numerator and denominator for the probability of no shared birthdays:
     - The numerator is calculated as the product of available days for each person.
     - The denominator is \( (2^n)^k \).
   - It calculates the probability of shared birthdays as \( p_{shared} = p_{total} - p_{no\_shared} \).
   - Finally, it simplifies \( A \) and \( B \) using `func_1` and prints them.

### Issues Identified:
- The function does not handle edge cases where `k` could be less than 2, which is outside the specified constraints but could lead to unexpected behavior if the constraints were not enforced.
- The output for the case when `k` exceeds \( 2^n \) is correctly implemented, but it does not consider cases where `k` is equal to \( 2^n \) or where `k` is very large relative to `n`, which could lead to performance issues or incorrect calculations due to integer overflow, although Python handles large integers.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case when `n` could be very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)), which could lead to inefficiencies in calculating \( 2^n \) for large values.

### Conclusion:
While the program seems to correctly handle the provided examples, it lacks robustness in handling edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description. Specifically, the handling of large values and the potential for incorrect outputs when `k` is very large relative to `n` could lead to incorrect results.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
