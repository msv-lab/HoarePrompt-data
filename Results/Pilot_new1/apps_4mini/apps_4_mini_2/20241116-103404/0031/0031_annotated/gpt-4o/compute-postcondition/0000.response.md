The code assigns a value to the variable `MOD`, which is calculated as \(10^6 + 3\). This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`, which remain as integers within their specified ranges. The value of `MOD` is now defined as `1000003`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), and `MOD` is 1000003.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003**
