You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2

Output
1 8
Input
1 3

Output
1 1
Input
4 3

Output
23 128


-----Note-----

In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.

In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: if n is a multiple of k then a is k (the GCD), b is 0. if n is not a multiple of k then a is the GCD of n and k, and b is 0 after the loop terminates.
    return a
    #The program returns the value of a, which is either k if n is a multiple of k, or the GCD of n and k otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, it returns `a` as the GCD. The function does not specifically check if `a` is a multiple of `b`; it simply calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, k):
    MOD = 10 ** 6 + 3
    if (k > 1 << n) :
        print(1, 1)
        return
        #The program returns None, as there is no value specified to be returned.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the program prints (1, 1) and returns without any further action. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the program does not execute any further operations.
    total_days = 1 << n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD
        
        denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numerator` is the product of terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, all modulo 1000003; `denominator` is `(2^n)^k mod 1000003`; if `k` is greater than 0, the loop executes `k` times; if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
    p_no_shared = numerator
    p_total = denominator
    p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
    A = p_shared
    B = p_total
    g = func_1(A, B)
    A //= g
    B //= g
    print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`. It prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function calculates a numerator and a denominator based on `k` and `n`, but does not return or print any output in this case. The function does not handle the scenario where `k` is 0 or negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The final output is only produced if `k` exceeds \(2^n\).




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
