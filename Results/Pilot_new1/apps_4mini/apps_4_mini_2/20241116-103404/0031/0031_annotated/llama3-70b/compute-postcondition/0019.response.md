The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It calculates `total_days` as \(2^n\), then computes the `numerator` as the product of \((2^n - i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to \(k-1\) and the `denominator` as \((2^n)^k\). If \(k\) is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and both `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. After the loop, the function computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the `numerator` and `denominator` and simplifies them accordingly. Finally, it returns both the simplified `numerator` and `denominator` modulo \(10^6 + 3\). 

However, the annotations inaccurately suggest that the function always returns (1, 1). In reality, the outputs depend on the values of `n` and `k`, especially when \(k\) is greater than 0. The function does not cover the case where \(k = 0\) explicitly, which would lead to returning (1, 1) due to the initial values of `numerator` and `denominator`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\), computes a numerator and denominator based on \(k\), simplifies them by their gcd, and returns the results modulo \(1000003\). If \(k\) is 0, it returns (1, 1). **
