According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1.

Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, it does not need to be adjusted, as the loop will still have a valid range to execute again. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`, which should be set to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
