The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the function returns the tuple (1 % 1000003, 1 % 1000003), which evaluates to (1, 1). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` and return the tuple (1, 1). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, and always returns the tuple (1, 1).**
