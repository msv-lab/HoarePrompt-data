The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), the new value of `denominator` will be \(1 \times 2^n = 2^n\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \(2^n\), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
