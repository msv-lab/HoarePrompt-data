The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, but the previous values of `denominator` and `total_days` are unknown. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `denominator` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days`, and the other variables remain unchanged.**
