Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. If `a` is an empty string, then `a` is set to '0'. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged and retains its value without leading zeros. In either case, `b` remains the string of the second integer without leading zeros.***
