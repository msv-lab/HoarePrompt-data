The string `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. The initial state indicates that `b` was originally an empty string, and now it has been changed to `'0'`. The first string `a` remains unchanged and retains its value. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` while `a` stays the same.

Output State: **`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers; the first string `a` is either unchanged or set to '0', and `b` is '0'.**
