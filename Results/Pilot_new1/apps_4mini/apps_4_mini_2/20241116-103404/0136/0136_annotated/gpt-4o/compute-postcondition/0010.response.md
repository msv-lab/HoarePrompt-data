Output State: **`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers; the first string `a` is unchanged or is '0' if it was originally empty, and has no leading zeros; the second string `b` is either '0' if it was originally empty or remains unchanged without leading zeros; the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`; and the output is '<'.**
