Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the function prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'. If the lengths are equal, the function compares the values of `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'; and if they are equal, it prints '='. Additionally, if `b` was originally an empty string, it is treated as '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The function correctly handles all cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros, ensuring accurate comparisons and outputs, including edge cases where `b` is empty or where both strings are equal.***
