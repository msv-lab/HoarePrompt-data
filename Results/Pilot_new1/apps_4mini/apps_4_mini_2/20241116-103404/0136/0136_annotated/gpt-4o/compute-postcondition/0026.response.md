The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeros, and each can contain no more than 10^6 digits. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of the two integers represented by `a` and `b`, also as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string, handling any leading zeros appropriately.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns the sum of a and b as a string.**
