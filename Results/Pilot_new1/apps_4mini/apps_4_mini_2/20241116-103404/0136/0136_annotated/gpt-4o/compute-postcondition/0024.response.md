Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two strings representing non-negative integers. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the function prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. Additionally, if `b` was originally an empty string, it is treated as '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The function correctly handles all cases where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros, ensuring accurate comparisons and outputs, including edge cases where `b` is empty or where both strings are equal.***
