The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input()` after removing any leading zeroes with the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is initially a string representation of a non-negative integer, its value may change depending on the input. If the input is a string of digits that contains leading zeroes, those will be removed. If the input is "0000", it will become an empty string, which in the context of non-negative integers can be treated as "0". The variable `b` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.**
