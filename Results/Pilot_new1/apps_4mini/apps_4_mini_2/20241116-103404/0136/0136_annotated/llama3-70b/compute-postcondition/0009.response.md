Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, and `b` is the input string after leading zeroes have been removed. The string `a` is not equal to `b`. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, the output is '>', indicating that `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`.***
