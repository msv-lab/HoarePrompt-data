The code executes a print statement which outputs the string '='. The previous values of the variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this print operation, and since `a` is equal to `b`, both variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string after leading zeroes have been removed, and `a` is equal to `b`. The output is '='.**
