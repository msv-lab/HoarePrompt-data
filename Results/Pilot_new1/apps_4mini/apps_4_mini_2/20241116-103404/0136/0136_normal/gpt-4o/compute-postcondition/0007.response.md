The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`, which means it will now hold the string `'0'`. The initial state mentions that `a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros, and if `a` was initially empty, it is set to '0'. However, since the code only affects `b`, the value of `a` remains unchanged. The output state reflects the changes made to `b` while noting that `a` is unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is '0'**
