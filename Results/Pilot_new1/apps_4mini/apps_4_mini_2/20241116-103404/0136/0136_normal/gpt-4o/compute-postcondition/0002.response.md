The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The variable `a` remains unchanged as this operation does not affect it. The value of `data` is also not altered. The output state reflects the new value of `b` after the leading zeros have been stripped. 

Output State: **`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input**
