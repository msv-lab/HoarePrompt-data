The code assigns the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed to the variable `a`. Since `a` is a string representing a non-negative integer, `lstrip('0')` will remove any leading zeros from that string. The variable `b` remains unaffected, and the initial state of `data` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a list of strings. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` after leading zeros are stripped.

Output State: **`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input**
