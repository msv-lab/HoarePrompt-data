The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes. Each string can have a length of up to 10^6 characters. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers represented as strings, potentially containing leading zeroes, with each string having a length of no more than 10^6 characters.**
