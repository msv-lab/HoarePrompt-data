The code prints the character '<', indicating that `a` is less than `b`. The values of the variables `a` and `b` are not changed by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and `a` is less than `b` in lexicographical order, and the output is '<'.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and `a` is less than `b` in lexicographical order, and the output is '<'**
