The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that the input string will have any leading zeroes removed. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The final state will reflect the updated value of `b` after leading zeroes have been stripped.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes**
