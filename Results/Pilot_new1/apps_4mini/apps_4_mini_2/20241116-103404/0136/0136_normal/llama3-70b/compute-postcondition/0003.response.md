The code prints the string `'='`, but it does not change the values of any variables. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `a` and `b`, along with the action taken.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, `a` is equal to `b`, and the output is '='**
