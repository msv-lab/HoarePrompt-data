The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input()` with leading zeroes removed using `lstrip('0')`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string that may contain leading zeroes, after executing this line, `a` will either be an empty string (if `input()` was "0" or all zeroes) or a string representation of the integer without leading zeroes. The variable `b` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
