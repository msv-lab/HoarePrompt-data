The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `'>'`. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same for `a` and `b`, and we include the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, and the output is '>'**
