The code executes a print statement that outputs the character '='. The variables `a`, `b`, and `data` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged apart from the printed output.

Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, `a` is equal to `b`, `data` remains unchanged, and '=' is printed.**
