Postcondition: ***`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, and `len(a)` is greater than or equal to `len(b)`, with `data` remaining unchanged. If `len(a)` is greater than `len(b)`, '>' is printed. If `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, the output is determined by comparing `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed; if `a` is equal to `b`, '=' is printed. This ensures that all comparisons are valid and no edge cases related to leading zeros or negative values are present.***
