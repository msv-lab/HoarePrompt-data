The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros from it using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, the value of `data[0]` could be any non-negative integer string. The impact of this code is that `a` will now hold the string representation of the integer value without leading zeros. The variable `b` and the list `data` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the integer without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of input strings split by whitespace**
