The value of `b` is assigned the string '0'. Since `a` is an empty string, it does not affect `b`, which is now explicitly set. The state of `data` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is '0', and `data` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '0', and `data` remains unchanged**
