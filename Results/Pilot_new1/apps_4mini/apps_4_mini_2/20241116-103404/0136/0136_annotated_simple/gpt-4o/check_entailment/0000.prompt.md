You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

Annotated Program:

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `a` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. In all cases, `b` remains the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `data` is a list of input strings split by whitespace. If `a` was not empty, it retains its original value.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *If `b` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. In all cases, `a` is either '0' (if it was originally empty) or retains its original value, `b` remains the string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros, and `data` remains unchanged.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, and `data` remains unchanged. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. The conditions ensure that both `a` and `b` have the same length, which prevents any edge cases related to leading zeros or negative values since `b` cannot have leading zeros and `a` is either '0' or equal to `b`.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, and `data` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. The conditions ensure that both `a` and `b` have the same length, preventing any edge cases related to leading zeros or negative values, thus maintaining the integrity of the comparisons.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`b` is a non-empty string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros, `a` is either '0' or retains its original value, and `len(a)` is greater than or equal to `len(b)`, with `data` remaining unchanged. If `len(a)` is greater than `len(b)`, '>' is printed. If `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`, the output is determined by comparing `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed; if `a` is equal to `b`, '=' is printed. This ensures that all comparisons are valid and no edge cases related to leading zeros or negative values are present.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
