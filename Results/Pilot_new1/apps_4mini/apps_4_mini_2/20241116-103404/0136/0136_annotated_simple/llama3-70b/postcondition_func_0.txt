The function accepts two non-negative integer inputs as strings, removes any leading zeroes from both inputs, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the two strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if it is greater. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are empty strings or invalid strings (non-numeric), which could lead to unexpected behavior.
