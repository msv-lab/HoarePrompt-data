The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '<'. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The output is simply the printed character. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and the string `a` is lexicographically less than the string `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and the string `a` is lexicographically less than the string `b`, and the function prints '<'**
