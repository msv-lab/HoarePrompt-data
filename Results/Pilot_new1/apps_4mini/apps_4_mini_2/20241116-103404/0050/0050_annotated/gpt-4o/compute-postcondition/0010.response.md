To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

1. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers.
   - `s` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`.
   - `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.
   - `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.
   - `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code calculates `total_bourles` using the formula:
     ```
     total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles
     ```
   - Here, `max_shares` is the number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles `r` at the minimum buy price, and `remaining_bourles` is the leftover amount after buying the maximum shares.

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The value of `total_bourles` is computed based on the previously defined variables. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`) remain unchanged.

4. **Output State**:
   - The output state will include the calculated value of `total_bourles` along with the unchanged states of the other variables.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is input integer, `m` is input integer, `r` is input integer, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
