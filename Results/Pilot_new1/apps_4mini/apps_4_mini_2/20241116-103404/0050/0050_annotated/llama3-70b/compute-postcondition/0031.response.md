Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, and `m` is greater than 0. If `shares` was greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without modifying `r` or `shares`.***
