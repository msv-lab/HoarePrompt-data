Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from input in descending order, and `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[1]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` and `r` unchanged in that case. Additionally, if `r` is exactly equal to `s[1]`, `shares` will be incremented by 1 and `r` will be set to 0, while for values of `r` less than `s[1]`, no changes to `shares` or `r` occur.***
