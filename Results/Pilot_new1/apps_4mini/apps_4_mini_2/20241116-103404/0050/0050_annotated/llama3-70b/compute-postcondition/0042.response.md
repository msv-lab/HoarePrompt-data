According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, which means we need to ensure that `i` is 3 and `m` must be at least 4 to allow another iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to 3.
- `m` should be greater than 3 to allow another iteration.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `m` is greater than 3, and `i` is 3**
