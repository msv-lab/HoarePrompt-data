The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `m` is between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from input in descending order, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
