The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged. The exact state of `s` after sorting depends on its initial values, which are provided via input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input.**
