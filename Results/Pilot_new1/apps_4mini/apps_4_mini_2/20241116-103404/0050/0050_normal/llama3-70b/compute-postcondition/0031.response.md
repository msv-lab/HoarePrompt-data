Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `s` is a non-empty list. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
