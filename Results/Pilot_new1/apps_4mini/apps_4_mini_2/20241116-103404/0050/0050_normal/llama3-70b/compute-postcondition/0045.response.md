The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as indicated by the absence of parameters in the function definition. However, it operates on the following constraints:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 30\).
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(s[i]\) is such that \(1 \leq s[i] \leq 1000\).
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer \(b[i]\) is such that \(1 \leq b[i] \leq 1000\).

Since the output of the function is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the specific return values or cases. Thus, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function operates on integers `n`, `m`, `r` and lists `s` and `b` with specified constraints but does not return any value or output based on the provided information.**
