According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value (which is `n-1` if we assume it started from 0). 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `n`, which is the next value in the range. Additionally, since `i` is now equal to `n`, the loop will not execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted as we don't have information about `s`, `r`, or `shares` in the context of the loop execution.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 30, `i` is `n`, `shares` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged**
