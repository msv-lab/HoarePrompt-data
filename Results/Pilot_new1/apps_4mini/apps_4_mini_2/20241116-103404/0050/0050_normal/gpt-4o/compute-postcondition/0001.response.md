The variable `s` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take an input of space-separated integers, convert each to an integer, and store them in a list. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged, as this operation only affects the variable `s`. The output state will reflect the new assignment to `s` based on the input provided, while the other variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from the input; `s` is a list of integers from the input; `b` is a list of m integers**
