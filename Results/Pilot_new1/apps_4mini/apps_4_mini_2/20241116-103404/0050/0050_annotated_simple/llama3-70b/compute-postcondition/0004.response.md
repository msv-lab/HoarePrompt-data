The list `b` is sorted in reverse order, meaning that its elements will be rearranged from largest to smallest. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new arrangement of `b` after sorting.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order**
