The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values through the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer. The states of the lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are taken from user input, they can be any integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now assigned input integer values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers.**
