According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, but we do not have the exact value of `i`. Since `i` is not specified, we must assume that it is currently less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next iteration. Assuming `i` was `k` at the end of the last iteration, it will now be `k + 1`.

Since `n` is greater than 1, we can conclude that `n` remains unchanged. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` is updated to `k + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is k + 1** (where k is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration).
