According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `m` is at least 2, it must be adjusted to be at least 3 for the loop to allow an additional iteration.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is at least `s[0]`, `m` is at least 3, and `i` is 3**
