Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `r` is at least `s[0]`, `m` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r` unchanged.***
