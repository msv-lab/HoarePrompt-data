Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the result of the integer division of `r` by `s[1]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` unchanged and `r` as it was.***
