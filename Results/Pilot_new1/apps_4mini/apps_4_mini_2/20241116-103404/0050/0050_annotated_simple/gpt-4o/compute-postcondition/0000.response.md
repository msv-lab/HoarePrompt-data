The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned from the input, which is split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not specified, so we only know they are integers within the specified ranges. Other variables (`s` and `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now assigned input values.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers within the ranges 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of n positive integers; `b` is a list of m positive integers**
