The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, which calculates the remainder of `r` when divided by `min_buy_price`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, and `max_shares` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the newly calculated value of `remaining_bourles`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers within the ranges 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of `n` positive integers; `b` is a list of `m` integers based on user input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`; `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is calculated as r // min_buy_price; `remaining_bourles` is calculated as r % min_buy_price.**
