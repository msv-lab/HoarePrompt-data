The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the expression (a_floor - b_floor) will yield a positive value. Therefore, `min_floor_time` will be greater than 10.

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.
- The specific values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are not provided, but we know that the difference is positive.

Since we cannot determine the exact values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`, we can only express the relationship and the resulting calculation. Thus, the output state reflects this relationship.

Output State: **`min_floor_time` is greater than 10, calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10, where `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`**.
