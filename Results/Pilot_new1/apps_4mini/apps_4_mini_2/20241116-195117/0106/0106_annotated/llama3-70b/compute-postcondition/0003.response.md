The variable `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a` is given, and `m` and `k` are also known input values. The operation involves integer division and addition. 

To determine the output state:
- The value of `a_block` will be assigned the result of the calculation, which depends on the specific values of `a`, `m`, and `k`.
- Other variables (`n`, `b`, `a_floor`) remain unchanged.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are not specified, we can only describe the impact of the calculation and how it relates to the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to new input values; `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range 1 to n·m·k; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1.**
