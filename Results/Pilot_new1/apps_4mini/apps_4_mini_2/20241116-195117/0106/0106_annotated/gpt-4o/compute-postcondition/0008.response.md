The value of `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The previous values of `block_a` and `block_b` are used to compute the absolute difference, and then the result is adjusted by `n` and multiplied by 15. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `floor_a`, and `floor_b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.**
