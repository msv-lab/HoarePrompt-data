The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is a distinct integer representing an apartment number, constrained such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers ranging from 1 to 1000. After executing the function body, it returns the values of 'block' and 'floor', which are calculated based on specific formulas related to the apartment number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding 'block' and 'floor' values based on the apartment number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, which is a distinct integer representing an apartment number, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' calculated based on the given formulas.**
