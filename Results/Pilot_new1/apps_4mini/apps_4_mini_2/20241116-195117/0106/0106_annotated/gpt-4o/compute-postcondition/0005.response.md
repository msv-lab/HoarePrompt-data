Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer parameter `apartment`, which represents an apartment number. It calculates and returns two values: `block`, which indicates the block number the apartment is in, and `floor`, which indicates the floor number within that block based on the formulas provided. The function does not handle any potential edge cases, such as negative apartment numbers or zero, which could lead to incorrect calculations. **
