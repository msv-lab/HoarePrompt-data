The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\). Additionally, `a` and `b` are distinct integers constrained such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\). After executing the function body, it returns the total time calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and distinct integers `a`, `b`, and return the total time based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), and a, b (distinct integers), and returns the total time calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor.**
