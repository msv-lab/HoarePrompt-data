Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15.**
