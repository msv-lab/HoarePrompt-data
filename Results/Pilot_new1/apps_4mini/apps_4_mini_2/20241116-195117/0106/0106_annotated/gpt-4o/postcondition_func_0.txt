The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as two distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from the location represented by `a` to the location represented by `b`. This total time is computed as the sum of the time to exit from the current floor, the minimum walking time between the blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function handles various scenarios based on the floor levels and the blocks, ensuring that the walking time is calculated correctly based on the absolute difference between the blocks.
