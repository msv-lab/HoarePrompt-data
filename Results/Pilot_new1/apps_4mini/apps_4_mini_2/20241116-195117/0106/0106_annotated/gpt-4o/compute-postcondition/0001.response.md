The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not explicitly given, but they are constrained by the initial state. The calculation involves taking the apartment number, subtracting 1, and then finding the remainder when divided by the product of `m` and `k`. 

Since `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers, we can assume `apartment` could be either `a` or `b`. 

The output state will reflect the calculation of `floor_within_block` based on the given constraints. 

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
