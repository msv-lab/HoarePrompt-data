To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and calculations based on the problem description. 

The program is supposed to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given parameters of the building (number of entrances, floors, and apartments per floor). 

### Key Points of the Problem:

1. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered from 1 to n * m * k.
2. **Floor and Entrance Calculation**: 
   - The floor of an apartment can be calculated by `(apartment_number - 1) % m + 1`.
   - The entrance (block) of an apartment can be calculated by `(apartment_number - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
3. **Time Calculations**:
   - Moving between entrances takes 15 seconds.
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds, with the lift taking 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor movement.

### Potential Issues in the Code:

1. **Entrance Calculation**: The calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` seems incorrect. The code uses `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which is not the correct way to find the entrance. It should be `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` for the correct entrance number, but the way it is structured, it might not correctly identify the entrance in all cases.
   
2. **Floor Time Calculation**: The code assumes that if `a_floor > b_floor`, then it calculates the time as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`, which implies that Edward is using the lift. However, if he is already on the first floor of his block, he cannot use the lift to go down. The lift can only be used to go up, and if he is already on the first floor, he would have to use stairs, which would not be considered in this calculation.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the scenario where both apartments are on the same floor but in different entrances. In such a case, the time should be calculated only based on the time taken to move between entrances, which is not properly isolated in the current logic.

### Example Case Where the Program Might Fail:

Consider the following case:
- Input: `1 1 1` (1 entrance, 1 floor, 1 apartment)
- Input: `1 2` (Edward is in apartment 1, Natasha is in apartment 2)

In this case, the program would incorrectly calculate the blocks and floors since there is only one apartment. It would not be able to handle this case correctly because it assumes there are multiple apartments and floors.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, especially with the handling of the entrance calculation and the edge cases, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description fully.

Correctness: **False**.
