To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the `func_1` function and see if it correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment under all possible scenarios.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Get Location Function**: 
   - The function `get_location` calculates the block (or entrance) and the floor for a given apartment number. This appears to be correct based on the description.
   - The formula used to determine the block and floor seems appropriate considering the structure of the building.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `time_to_exit` based on whether Edward is on the first floor or not. If he is not on the first floor, it adds 10 seconds for the elevator wait time and the time to go down to the first floor.
   - The walking time between blocks (entrances) is calculated in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise), which is correct. It uses the modulo operation to ensure that the circular nature of the building is respected.
   - The time to reach Natasha's floor from the first floor is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, which is correct as each floor transition takes 5 seconds.

3. **Return Value**:
   - Finally, the total time is calculated by summing `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, which seems to follow the problem description correctly.

### Potential Edge Cases

- **Case where Edward is on the first floor**: If Edward is already on the first floor of his block, `time_to_exit` will be 0. This case is handled correctly.
  
- **Case where Edward and Natasha are in the same block (entrance)**: If they are in the same block, the program should correctly calculate the time based only on the floor difference and not include any walking time between blocks.

- **Minimum values for n, m, k**: When `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `k = 1`, the only apartment is 1, and since `a` and `b` are guaranteed to be different, this case is not applicable. However, if `n = 1` and there are multiple floors and apartments, the walking time should be correctly calculated as there are no other blocks to walk to.

- **Maximum values for n, m, k**: With maximum values (1000, 1000, 1000), the program should still function correctly without overflow or performance issues since Python handles large integers and the operations involved are straightforward.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and the potential edge cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic required to calculate the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha under all given conditions in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
