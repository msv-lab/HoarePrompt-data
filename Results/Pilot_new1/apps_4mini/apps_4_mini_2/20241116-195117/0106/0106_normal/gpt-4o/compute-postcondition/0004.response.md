The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number, and it must be a distinct integer such that 1 ≤ `apartment` ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers constrained between 1 and 1000. After executing the function body, it returns the values of `block` and `floor`, which are calculated based on `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return its corresponding `block` and `floor` based on the calculations involving the apartment number and the dimensions of the building represented by `m` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on calculations from 'apartment', 'm', and 'k'.**
