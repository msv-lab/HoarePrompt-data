To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The program should calculate the minimum time Edward can take to reach Natasha's apartment from his apartment in a circular building with multiple entrances, floors, and apartments. The time taken for various transitions (e.g., using stairs or the elevator) is specified.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function determines the block and floor of a given apartment number.
   - The calculations appear to be correct based on the description, as it uses integer division and modulo operations to derive the block and floor.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It calculates the time for Edward to exit his floor, walk to Natasha's block, and then reach her floor.
   - The time to exit is calculated correctly, considering the elevator wait time and the time taken to descend floors.
   - The walking time between blocks is calculated using both direct and reverse paths, which is appropriate for a circular building.
   - The time taken to reach the target floor is also calculated correctly.

### Output Hints Analysis
- **Function 1 Hint**: The hint describes the function's purpose and mentions it calculates the total time based on the time to exit, walking time, and floor reaching time. This aligns with the function's implementation.
- **Function 2 Hint**: The hint states that the function does not handle invalid values for `apartment`, `m`, or `k`. However, the problem guarantees that the apartment numbers are valid and distinct, so this hint does not point to a flaw in the logic of the program as it pertains to the given constraints.

### Edge Cases
- The main edge cases to consider would be:
  - Moving between the first and last blocks (circular transition).
  - Moving from the first floor to the first floor of another block.
  - The scenario where Edward is on the first floor of his block (no elevator time needed).
  
However, the provided code handles these scenarios as follows:
- The circular nature of the building is accounted for in the walking time calculations.
- The elevator logic is properly implemented, and the code correctly handles the transition between floors.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the code, the problem description, and the output hints, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The logic for calculating the time is sound, and the assumptions made in the hints do not introduce any contradictions.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
