The variable `block` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. However, the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, so I cannot compute a specific numerical value for `block`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship and calculations based on the provided expression.

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
