The variable `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. The previous values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are not specified, but `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `min_walk_time` without changing other variables.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**
