The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. After executing the function body, it returns the sum of three components: `time_to_exit`, the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return a calculated sum based on the specified components. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, and returns the sum of time_to_exit, the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, and (floor_b - 1) * 5.**
