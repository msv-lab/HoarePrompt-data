The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned from the input, where the input is expected to be three integers separated by spaces. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified, but they will be replaced by the values from the input. The output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values**
