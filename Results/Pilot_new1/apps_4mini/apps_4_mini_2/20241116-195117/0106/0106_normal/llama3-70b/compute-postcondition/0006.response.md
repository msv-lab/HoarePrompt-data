To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code provided step by step. 

1. We have the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_floor`, `b_floor`, and `b_block`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values, while `a` and `b` are also input integers. 
2. `a_floor` is constrained to be in the range `1` to `m`, and `b_floor` is similarly constrained. 
3. The variable `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
4. The expression `min_block_time` is computed as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

Given that `a_block` is not defined in the initial state, we will assume it is derived from `a_floor` or some related calculation that is not provided in the initial state. However, since we cannot determine `a_block` without additional context, we can only comment on the calculation of `min_block_time`.

Assuming `a_block` is defined and has a value, the calculation of `min_block_time` will depend on the values of `a_block`, `b_block`, and `n`.

Since we don't have specific values for `a_block`, we cannot compute an exact output state for `min_block_time`. Therefore, we will express the output state in terms of the known variables and the calculations involved.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `a_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `b_floor` is in the range 1 to m; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.**
