Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the corresponding `block` and `floor` based on the formula provided. It returns a tuple containing `block` and `floor`, where `block` is determined by the division of the apartment number by the total number of apartments per block (m * k), and `floor` is calculated as the position of the apartment within its block divided by the number of apartments per floor (k). The function does not handle any edge cases such as invalid apartment numbers (e.g., negative or zero values). **
