The variable `block` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, and `a` and `b` are integers also within the specified range. However, the specific value of `apartment` is not provided in the initial state, making it impossible to determine the exact value of `block`. Therefore, the output state reflects the dependency on the unspecified variable `apartment`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
