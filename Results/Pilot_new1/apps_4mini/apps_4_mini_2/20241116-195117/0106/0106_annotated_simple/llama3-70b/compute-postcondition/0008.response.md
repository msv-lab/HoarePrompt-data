The value of `min_floor_time` is calculated using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. The previous values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are known, with `a_floor` being greater than `b_floor`. The calculation does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `min_floor_time` based on the given formula.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are integers; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10.**
