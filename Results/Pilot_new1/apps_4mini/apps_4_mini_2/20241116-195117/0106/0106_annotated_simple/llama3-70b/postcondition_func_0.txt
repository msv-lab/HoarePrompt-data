The function accepts five integer inputs: `n`, `m`, and `k` (which are positive integers), and `a` and `b` (which are integers representing apartment numbers). It calculates the time taken to move between two apartments `a` and `b` based on their respective floors and blocks within a building structure defined by `m` and `k`. The total time is computed as the sum of the time spent moving between blocks and the time spent moving between floors, which includes a fixed time cost. The function prints the total time calculated. It does not handle any invalid input cases or constraints on the values of `a` and `b` relative to `n`.
