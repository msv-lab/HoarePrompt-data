To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code step by step and check if it handles all potential edge cases.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads `n`, `m`, `k`, which represent the number of blocks (entrances), floors, and apartments per floor, respectively.
   - It reads `a` and `b`, which are the apartment numbers for Edward and Natasha.

2. **Floor and Block Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the floor (`a_floor`, `b_floor`) and block (`a_block`, `b_block`) for both apartments.
   - The formulas used are:
     - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1` (calculates the floor number based on the apartment number)
     - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` (calculates the block number based on the apartment number)

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum time to reach Natasha's apartment by:
     - Finding the minimum time to move between blocks (`min_block_time`), considering the circular nature of the blocks.
     - Calculating the time to reach the correct floor using the elevator (`min_floor_time`), which includes a 10-second wait time for the elevator.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the total time as the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

### Analysis of Potential Issues:

1. **Block Calculation**:
   - The formula for calculating the block number seems incorrect. It uses `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which assumes the block number is determined by the total number of apartments per block (which is `m * k`). However, the correct calculation should be based on the number of apartments per block (which is `m * k` apartments per entrance).
   - The correct block calculation should be: 
     ```python
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```

2. **Floor Calculation**:
   - The floor calculation appears correct, as it correctly maps the apartment number to its corresponding floor.

3. **Time Calculation Logic**:
   - The elevator time calculation (`min_floor_time`) adds a 10-second wait time, but it does not account for the scenario where Edward is already on the first floor. In that case, he should not wait for the elevator since he can directly go to Natasha's floor.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `a` is on the first floor and `b` is also on the first floor but in a different block, the elevator time should not be added since Edward can walk directly to Natasha's block.
   - The program does not handle cases where the blocks are adjacent and the floors are the same, leading to potentially incorrect time calculations.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement, particularly regarding elevator usage and block calculations. Hence, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

**Example of Failure**: If Edward is in apartment 1 (first floor, block 1) and Natasha is in apartment 2 (first floor, block 1), the program would incorrectly calculate elevator wait time when it should simply calculate the time to walk to Natasha's apartment, which would be 0 seconds in this case.
