The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0 and potentially 1, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 3`, and the program has exited.
