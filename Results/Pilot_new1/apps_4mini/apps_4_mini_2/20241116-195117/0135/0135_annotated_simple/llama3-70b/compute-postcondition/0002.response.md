According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to `k`, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `n` does not affect the loop's execution directly, but `seen` is an empty set and does not impact the loop's execution either.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 1, which is the first value in the range. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
