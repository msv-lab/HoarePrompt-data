To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    seen = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen:
            print('No')
            exit()
        
        seen.add(remainder)
        
    print('Yes')
```

### Code Logic Breakdown:
1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the unique remainders.
3. It iterates over integers from `1` to `k`:
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
   - It checks if this remainder has already been seen (exists in the `seen` set).
   - If it has been seen, it prints "No" and exits.
   - If it hasn't been seen, it adds the remainder to the `seen` set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- **Case when `k = 1`:** 
  - The only remainder calculated will be `n % 1`, which is `0`. Since there's no other `i`, the output will be "Yes", which is correct.
  
- **Case when `n < k`:**
  - For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 5`, the remainders will be `3 % 1 = 0`, `3 % 2 = 1`, `3 % 3 = 0`, `3 % 4 = 3`, `3 % 5 = 3`. Here, `0` and `3` are both repeated, so the output should be "No". The program will correctly identify this case.
  
- **Case when `n` is large and `k` is small:** 
  - For instance, if `n = 10^18` and `k = 5`, the remainders will be `0, 0, 0, 2, 0`, which would lead to "No". The program handles this correctly.

- **General Case:** 
  - The program will correctly handle any situation where `n` and `k` are both large, as it only loops `k` times and checks for duplicates in a set.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the remainders are distinct for all integers from `1` to `k`. Every potential edge case examined aligns with the expected output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
