The code executes the `print` statement, which outputs the string 'No'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, `remainder`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now includes 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the output is 'No'**
