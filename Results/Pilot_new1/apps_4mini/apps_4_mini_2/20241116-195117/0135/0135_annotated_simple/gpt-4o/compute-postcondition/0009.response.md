According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `k` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop continues. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `k` is already greater than or equal to 1, and the other variables do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0**
