Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainder of `n` when divided by integers from 1 to `k` is repeated. If `k` is less than `n` and all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns None. **
