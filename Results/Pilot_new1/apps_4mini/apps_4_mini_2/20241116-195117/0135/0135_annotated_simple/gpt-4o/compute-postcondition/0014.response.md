Output State: **`seen_remainders` contains the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If any remainder is repeated during the loop execution, the function returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, the loop completes without returning 'No'. Therefore, if `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders of `n % i` for `i` from 1 to `k`.**
