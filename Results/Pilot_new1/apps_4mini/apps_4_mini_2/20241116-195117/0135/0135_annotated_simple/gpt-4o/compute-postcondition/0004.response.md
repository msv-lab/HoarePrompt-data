According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, since the range is from 1 to `k + 1`. The variable `i` will take values starting from 1 up to `k`. 

Since `seen_remainders` is an empty set before the loop starts, it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to be executed, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start at 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
