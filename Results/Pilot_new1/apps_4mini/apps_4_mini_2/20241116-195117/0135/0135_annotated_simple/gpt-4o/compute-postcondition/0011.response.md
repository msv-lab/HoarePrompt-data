According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Therefore, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. Since `k` is currently only specified as being greater than or equal to 1, we need to adjust it to ensure that it is greater than or equal to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
