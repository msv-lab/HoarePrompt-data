The `seen_remainders` variable is assigned an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and there is no return statement executed at this point. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new state of `seen_remainders`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
