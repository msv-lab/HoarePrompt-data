The variable `seen_remainders` is initialized as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`, which remain as integers within the specified range. Since the code does not return anything and only initializes a new variable, the output state reflects the current values of `n` and `k`, along with the new variable.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
