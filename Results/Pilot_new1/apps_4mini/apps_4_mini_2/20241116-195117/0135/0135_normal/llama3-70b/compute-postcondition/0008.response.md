The `seen` set is modified by adding the value of `remainder` to it. Since `remainder` is 0 and it is specified that `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program execution would have terminated with an output of 'No' before this line. However, since the code provided is executed, it indicates that `remainder` was not found in `seen` at the time of execution, allowing the program to continue. 

After executing the line `seen.add(remainder)`, the set `seen` will now include the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains the value 0, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains the value 0, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
