Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, 'No' is printed and the program exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues without any output or change in the variable states.***
