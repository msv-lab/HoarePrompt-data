To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. We need to check if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct.
2. The output should be "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise.
3. The edge case where `k >= n` is handled, returning "No" since `n % n = 0` and `n % 1 = 0`, hence they are not distinct.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1(n, k)` does the following:
- If `k >= n`, it returns 'No'.
- It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to track distinct remainders.
- It iterates over each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`.
- If a remainder has already been seen (exists in the set), it returns 'No'.
- If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

### Testing Edge Cases
1. **Case where `k` is much larger than `n`:**
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the remainders would be:
     - `5 % 1 = 0`
     - `5 % 2 = 1`
     - `5 % 3 = 2`
     - `5 % 4 = 1` (duplicate)
   - The program should return 'No', which it does.

2. **Case where `k` is equal to `n`:**
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders would be:
     - `4 % 1 = 0`
     - `4 % 2 = 0` (duplicate)
   - The program correctly returns 'No'.

3. **Case where `k` is less than `n`:**
   - For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders would be:
     - `5 % 1 = 0`
     - `5 % 2 = 1`
     - `5 % 3 = 2`
   - All distinct, so it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Case with large values:**
   - For `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`, the program would return 'No' since `10^18 % 10^18 = 0` and `10^18 % 1 = 0`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly identifies cases where remainders are not distinct and handles the edge cases appropriately. 

Correctness: **True** 

The logic is sound, and I could not find any potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.
