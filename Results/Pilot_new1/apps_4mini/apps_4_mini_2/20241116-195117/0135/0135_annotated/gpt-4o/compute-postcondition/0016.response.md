The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

- Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 2: If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return anything, and this case is not explicitly handled in the provided code.
- Case 3: If any `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If no such `remainder` is found, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the values of these parameters, it returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if a duplicate remainder is found; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' if no duplicates are found and `k` is less than `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n` or if a duplicate remainder is found; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' if no duplicates are found and `k` is less than `n.**
