The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any duplicate remainder is found when calculating `n` modulo each integer from 1 to `k`. If no duplicates are found and `k` is less than `n`, the function returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
