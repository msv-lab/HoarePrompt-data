According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k + 1`. Given that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, we know that `k` is at least 1. 

At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will hold the value of `k`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least 1, and `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `k`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
