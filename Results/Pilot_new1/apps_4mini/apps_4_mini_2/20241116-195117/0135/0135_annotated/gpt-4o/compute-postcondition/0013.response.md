According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. Additionally, since `k` is at least 3 and can be as high as 10^18, we do not need to adjust `k` as long as it is greater than or equal to 4.

The `seen_remainders` set remains unchanged as it is empty and does not influence the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.**
