The code executes a print statement that outputs 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % 3,` and the function prints 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % 3,` and the function prints 'No'**.
