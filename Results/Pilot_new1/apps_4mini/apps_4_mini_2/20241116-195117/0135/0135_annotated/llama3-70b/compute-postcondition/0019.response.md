Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, and `remainder` is the result of `n % 3`. If `remainder` is present in `seen`, the function prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, the function continues execution without printing 'No'.***
