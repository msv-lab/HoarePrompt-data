The code initializes a variable `seen` as an empty set. This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`, which remain as input integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new state of `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set**
