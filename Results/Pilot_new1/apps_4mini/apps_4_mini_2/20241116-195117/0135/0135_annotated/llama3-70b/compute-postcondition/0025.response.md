Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input and checks for unique remainders when `n` is divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. It does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, which would result in no output since the loop would not execute. **
