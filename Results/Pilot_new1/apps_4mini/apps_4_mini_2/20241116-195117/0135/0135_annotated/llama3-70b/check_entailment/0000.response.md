To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code and its behavior.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to check if all remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is no pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` where `n % i = n % j`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The code reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Set for Tracking Remainders**: It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the unique remainders.
3. **Loop from 1 to k**: The loop iterates through each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`.
4. **Check for Duplicates**: If the remainder has already been seen (exists in `seen`), it prints 'No' and exits.
5. **Adding Remainders**: If the remainder is unique, it gets added to the `seen` set.
6. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints 'Yes'.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- The code does not explicitly handle the case where `k < 1`, but according to the problem constraints, `k` is always at least `1`. Therefore, this does not seem to be an issue in practice.

### Annotation Analysis:
The annotations state that:
- The function checks for unique remainders when `n` is divided by integers from `1` to `k`.
- If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits.
- If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'.

The annotations seem to correctly describe the function's behavior and align with the problem requirements.

### Test Cases:
- For the input `4 4`, the remainders are `0 (4%1), 0 (4%2), 1 (4%3), 0 (4%4)`, which indeed are not distinct (`0` appears multiple times). The output is 'No', which is correct.
- For the input `5 3`, the remainders are `0 (5%1), 1 (5%2), 2 (5%3)`, which are distinct. The output is 'Yes', which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies whether all remainders are distinct for the given inputs, and the annotations accurately reflect the logic and edge cases handled by the code.

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles the cases as expected.
