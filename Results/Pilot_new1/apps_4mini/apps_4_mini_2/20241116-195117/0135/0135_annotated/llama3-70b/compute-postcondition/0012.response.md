The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, and the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is `n % 2`, and the output is 'No'**
