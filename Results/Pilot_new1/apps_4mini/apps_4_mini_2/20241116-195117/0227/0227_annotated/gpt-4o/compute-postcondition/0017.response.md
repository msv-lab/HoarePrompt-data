The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
