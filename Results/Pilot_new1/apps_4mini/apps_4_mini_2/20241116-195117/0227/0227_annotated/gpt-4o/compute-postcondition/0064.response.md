The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unchanged, so we do not know its exact value. The values of `can_form`, `i`, and `assigned` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `i` is 3, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `i` is 3, and `m` is increased by 1**
