The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 4, `x` is the fifth element of `assigned`, `n` is greater than 3, and `assigned` has at least 5 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
