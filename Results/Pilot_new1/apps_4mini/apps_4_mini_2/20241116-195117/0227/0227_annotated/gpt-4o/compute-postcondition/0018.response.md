Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the value of `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues execution without breaking. Additionally, since `a` is sorted and contains distinct positive integers, edge cases include ensuring that `a[i]` is always greater than `x` for valid comparisons.***
