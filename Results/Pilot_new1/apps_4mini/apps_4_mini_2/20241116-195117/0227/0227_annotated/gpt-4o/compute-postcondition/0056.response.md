Postcondition: ***If `a[i] - x` (where `x` is the second element in `assigned`) is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `m` remains unchanged and `i` is 3. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, `m` stays the same, and `i` is still 3.***
