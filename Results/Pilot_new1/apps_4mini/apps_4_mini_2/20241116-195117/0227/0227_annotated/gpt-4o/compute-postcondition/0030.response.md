The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 2, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, `n` is greater than 2, and the value of `a[i] - x` is in the list `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
