The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown, so we cannot specify its new value. The other variables (`can_form`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `i` is still 2, and `m` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `i` is still 2, and `m` is incremented by 1**
