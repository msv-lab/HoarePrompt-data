The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
