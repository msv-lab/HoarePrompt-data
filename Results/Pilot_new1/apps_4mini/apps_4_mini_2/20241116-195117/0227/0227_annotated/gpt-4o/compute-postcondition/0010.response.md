Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, indicating that no such element exists in the list.***
