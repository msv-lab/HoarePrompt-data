The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment, and the other variables remain in their initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first two elements of `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
