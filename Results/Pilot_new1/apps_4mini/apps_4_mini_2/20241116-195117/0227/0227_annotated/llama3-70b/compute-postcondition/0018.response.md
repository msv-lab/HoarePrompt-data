Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list `a` are not equal to twice the preceding element. If the count `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, and it assumes valid input is always provided. **
