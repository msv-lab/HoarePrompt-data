The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers in ascending order. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a` is composed of distinct positive integers, after executing the sort method, the order of the elements in `a` will change to be in ascending order. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the sorting operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23); `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers**
