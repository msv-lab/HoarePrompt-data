The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is 1, so after execution, `m` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `a` is not equal to double the element at index `i - 1` of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `a` is not equal to double the element at index `i - 1` of `a`.**
