Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, which contains at least 3 elements, and `i` is 1, where `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
