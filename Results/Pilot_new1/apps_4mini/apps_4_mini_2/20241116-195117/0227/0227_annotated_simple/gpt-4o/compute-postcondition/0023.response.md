Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, the value of `m` remains unchanged. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is unchanged. If `assigned` contains only one element, the loop executes once, and if the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False and `m` is increased by 1.***
