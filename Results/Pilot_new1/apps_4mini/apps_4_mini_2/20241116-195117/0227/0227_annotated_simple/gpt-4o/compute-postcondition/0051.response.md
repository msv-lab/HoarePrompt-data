The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is an integer greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
