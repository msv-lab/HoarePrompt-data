The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state indicates that `can_form` was determined based on the conditions involving `a[i] - x`, `assigned` containing at least 3 elements, `i` being 1, and `x` being the second element of `assigned`. However, since the code snippet directly assigns `True` to `can_form`, the previous conditions do not affect the output state.

Output State: **`can_form` is True**
