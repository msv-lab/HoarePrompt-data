The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and `x` is contained in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
