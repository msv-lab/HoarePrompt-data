Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, indicating that there does not exist an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and that element is also in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop did not execute, and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains only one element, the loop executed once without meeting the condition, leaving `can_form` as False.***
