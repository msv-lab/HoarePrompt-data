The statement `can_form = False` assigns the value `False` to the variable `can_form`. Since `can_form` was already `False`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains the element `a[n-1]`, `i` is n.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains the element `a[n-1]`, `i` is n**
