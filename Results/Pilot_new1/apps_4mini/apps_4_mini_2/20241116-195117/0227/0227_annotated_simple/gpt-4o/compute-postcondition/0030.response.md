The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically the element `a[n-1]`), `i` is n, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
