The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers, the order of these integers will change based on their values, but the number of elements and their distinctness remain the same. The output state will reflect the sorted version of the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is the sorted list of distinct integers**
