The value of `m` is incremented by 1. Since `m` is an integer greater than its initial value, the new value of `m` will be greater than the previous value. The states of the other variables (`can_form`, `assigned`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `m` is an integer greater than its initial value plus 1, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is equal to `n - 1`.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is an integer greater than its initial value plus 1, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable, and `i` is equal to `n - 1**
