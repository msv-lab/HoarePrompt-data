The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, so it changes to `True`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, `x`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is `True`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically the element `a[n-1]`), `i` is `n`, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically the element `a[n-1]`), `i` is n, `x` is the first element of `assigned`**
