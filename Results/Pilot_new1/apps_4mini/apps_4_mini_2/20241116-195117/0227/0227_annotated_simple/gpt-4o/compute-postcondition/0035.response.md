Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, where `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`. If the condition is met, `m` is increased by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the values of `m`, `assigned`, `i`, and `x` remain as they were before the execution of the program fragment.***
