Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, and `m` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, `m` is still increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically the element `a[n-1]`), `i` is n, and `x` is the first element of `assigned`.***
