Postcondition: ***If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The integer `m` remains greater than its initial value, `assigned` is a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, and `i` is equal to `n`. If the condition is not satisfied, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the loop continues without any modifications to `m`, `assigned`, or `i`.***
