To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Breakdown
- We need to find the minimum number of variables \( m \) such that a sequence of operations can be performed.
- The first operation assigns \( a_1 \) to one of the variables.
- Subsequent operations involve assigning sums of previously assigned variables to new variables.
- If it is impossible to perform the sequence of operations with any number of variables \( m \), we should return -1.

### Program Analysis
```python
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()  # Sort the input array
    assigned = set()  # Set to keep track of assigned values
    assigned.add(a[0])  # Assign the first value
    m = 1  # Start with one variable
    for i in range(1, n):  # Iterate from the second element
        can_form = False
        for x in assigned:  # Check if current a[i] can be formed
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        if not can_form:  # If it can't be formed
            m += 1  # Increase the count of variables
        assigned.add(a[i])  # Add current value to assigned set
    return m
```

### Key Points in the Code
1. The input list \( a \) is sorted.
2. The first element \( a[0] \) is assigned to the first variable.
3. For each subsequent element \( a[i] \), it checks if it can be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values.
4. If it cannot be formed, it increments the count of variables \( m \).

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Case with impossible formation:** Consider the input:
   ```
   3
   1 2 5
   ```
   - Here, \( 5 \) cannot be formed by the sum of \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) since \( 1 + 2 \neq 5 \). The program should increment \( m \) to 3, but it will incorrectly return 2 since it does not account for the impossibility of forming \( 5 \) with \( 1 \) and \( 2 \).
  
2. **Case with negative outcomes:** Consider the input:
   ```
   4
   1 3 5 8
   ```
   - The program will assign \( 1 \) to \( b_1 \), \( 3 \) can be formed as \( 1 + 2 \) (but \( 2 \) is not in the assigned set), so it should increment \( m \) here too.

### Conclusion
The program will fail in cases where it cannot form the required sums, and it does not return -1 in such scenarios. Therefore, the logic for determining the minimum number of variables \( m \) is flawed.

Correctness: **False**.
