Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of variables \( m \) needed to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem statement. 

For instance, consider the input:

```
4
1 2 3 5
```

According to the problem description, we can only assign values to \( b_y \) based on the sum of two previously assigned variables. In this case, the required operations cannot be performed with any number of variables \( m \). Specifically, to get the value 3, we would need to have both 1 and 2 assigned to some variables first, but the given logic only checks for doubling the previous value. Therefore, the output should be -1, but the program would output 3 because it incorrectly increments \( m \) based on the doubling condition without considering the actual sums needed.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where the required sums cannot be formed, leading to incorrect results.
