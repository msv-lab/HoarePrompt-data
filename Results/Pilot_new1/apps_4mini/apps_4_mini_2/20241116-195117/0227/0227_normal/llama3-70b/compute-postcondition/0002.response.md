The `a.sort()` method sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is just an integer indicating the number of elements in the list `a`. The list `a` will now be in sorted order, but since the specific values of `a` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact sorted list. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that the list `a` has been sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers**
