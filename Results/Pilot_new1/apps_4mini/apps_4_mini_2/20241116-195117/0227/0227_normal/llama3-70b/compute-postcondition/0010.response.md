Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is either 2 or 3, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being 3. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` remains unchanged at 2.***
