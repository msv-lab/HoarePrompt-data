According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be adjusted to be 2 for the loop to execute one more time. Since the loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue. 

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- Since `can_form` affects `m`, if `can_form` was False, `m` would be increased by 1, but if it was True, `m` remains unchanged. 

Since we don't have specific information about `m` or `can_form`, we will keep `m` as is unless it was adjusted in the last iteration due to `can_form` being False. 

Thus, we can summarize the adjusted states as follows:

State: **`can_form` is the same, `m` is unchanged (or increased by 1 if `can_form` was False), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
