Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[3] - x` is found in `assigned`, which means `a[3] - x` is an element of `assigned`, with `i` being 3, `n` greater than 2, `assigned` containing at least three elements, and `x` being the third element in `assigned`. If these conditions are satisfied, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the conditions are not satisfied, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
