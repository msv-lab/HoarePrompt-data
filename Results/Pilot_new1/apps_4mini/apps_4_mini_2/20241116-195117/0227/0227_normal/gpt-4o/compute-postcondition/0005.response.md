The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `can_form` is False.
