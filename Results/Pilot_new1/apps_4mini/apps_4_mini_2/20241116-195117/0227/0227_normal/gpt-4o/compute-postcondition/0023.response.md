Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. This means that if there are no elements in `assigned` or only one element, `can_form` will be False, resulting in an increment of `m`. Otherwise, if `assigned` contains enough elements to satisfy the condition for `can_form`, `m` will not change.***
