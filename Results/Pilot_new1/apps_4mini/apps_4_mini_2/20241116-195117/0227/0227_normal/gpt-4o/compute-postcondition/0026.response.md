The value of `can_form` is assigned `False`. Since `can_form` was previously the same, it is now explicitly set to `False`. The variables `m` and `i` remain unchanged, and `n` remains greater than 2. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is `False`, `m` is unchanged (or increased by 1 if `can_form` was False), `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is unchanged (or increased by 1 if `can_form` was False), `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**
