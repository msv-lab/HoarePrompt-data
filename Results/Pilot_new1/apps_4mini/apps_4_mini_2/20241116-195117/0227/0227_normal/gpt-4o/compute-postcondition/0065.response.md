Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if any value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`; if `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is unchanged. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. Thus, `m` is incremented only when `can_form` is False, and the conditions regarding `i`, `n`, and the size of `assigned` are satisfied.***
