The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` may be increased by 1, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `assigned` includes at least one element (specifically `a[2]`), and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
