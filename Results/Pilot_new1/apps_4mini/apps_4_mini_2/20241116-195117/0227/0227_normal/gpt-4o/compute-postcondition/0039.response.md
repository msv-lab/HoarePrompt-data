Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the list `assigned`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `assigned` contains at least 3 elements. If the condition is met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged.***
