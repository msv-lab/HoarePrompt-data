The operation appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `r_index` (which is a popped value from `r_queue`) and `n` (the length of the `votes` string). Since `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, it does not affect the operation.

The output state reflects the updated state of `r_queue`, which will now contain one additional element, specifically the value of `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes with the first index removed, `r_queue` has one more element (the value `r_index + n` appended), `n` is the length of the `votes` string, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, and `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
