The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, it processes the `votes` string to determine the outcome based on the characters within it. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of 'D' and 'R', and return a result based on the analysis of the votes. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string votes of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the analysis of the votes.**
