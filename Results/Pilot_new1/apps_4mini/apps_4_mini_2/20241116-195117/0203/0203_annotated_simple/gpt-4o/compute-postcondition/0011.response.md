The code `d_queue.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, the value of `i` being appended is 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (a positive integer), `votes` (a non-empty string), `i` (1), and `v` (the second character of `votes`). The state of `d_queue` is not provided, so we cannot determine its previous state or if it exists. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to `d_queue` without changing the values of `n`, `votes`, `i`, or `v`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and 1 is appended to `d_queue`**.
