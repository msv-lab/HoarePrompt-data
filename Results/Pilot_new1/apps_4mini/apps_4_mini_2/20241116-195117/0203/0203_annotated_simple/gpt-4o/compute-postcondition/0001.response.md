The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` is not directly affected by this operation, as it is not modified. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `votes` with the input value, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `votes` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace**
