The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n` and `votes` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `votes`, along with the new state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on user input; `votes` is the input string without leading or trailing whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list**
