Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` includes `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has `r_index + n` appended. This covers the case where `d_index` is equal to or greater than `r_index`, ensuring that both queues are updated based on the comparison of their first elements.***
