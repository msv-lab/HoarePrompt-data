The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. This means that `d_queue` will now have one less element, and `d_index` will hold the value of the index that was at the front of the queue. The state of `r_queue` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged**.
