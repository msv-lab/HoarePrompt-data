The function accepts input in the form of a positive integer followed by a string of votes consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes in a way that simulates a competition between 'D' and 'R' votes, where each 'D' vote can eliminate an 'R' vote and vice versa. After processing all possible eliminations, the function prints 'D' if there are remaining 'D' votes, or 'R' if all 'D' votes have been eliminated. If there are no votes initially, it defaults to printing 'R'.
