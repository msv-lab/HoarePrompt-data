Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has at least 1 element (now one less). If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one additional element which is `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` remains not empty. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated with `r_index + n`, maintaining at least one element in `d_queue`, and `d_index` remains the first element of the original `d_queue`, while `r_index` is the element removed from the front of `r_queue`.***
