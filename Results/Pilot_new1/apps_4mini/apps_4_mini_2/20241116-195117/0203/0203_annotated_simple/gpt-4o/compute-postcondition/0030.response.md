The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is known (the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`), and `n` is an additional value that is added to `d_index`. The state of `d_queue` will now include this new element, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `d_queue` now includes `d_index + n`.**
