According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop iterates over each character in `fractions`. At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the next character in the string. Since `fractions` is a non-empty string, it means there are still characters left to process.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the `fraction` to the next character in the string. The variable `fractions` itself remains unchanged, and no other states related to `depublicans` or `remocrats` need to be modified since they depend on the current `fraction`.

Thus, the only change needed is to update `fraction` to the next character in the string, which we cannot determine explicitly from the provided state. However, we know that `fraction` will be the next character in the sequence of `fractions`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the next character in the string**
