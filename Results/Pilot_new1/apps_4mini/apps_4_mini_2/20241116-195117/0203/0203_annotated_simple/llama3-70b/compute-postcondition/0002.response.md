The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' based on user input. The initialization of `depublicans` does not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `depublicans` while maintaining the initial conditions of `n` and `fractions`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0**
