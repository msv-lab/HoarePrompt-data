The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. `n` is a positive integer that must satisfy the constraint (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent the affiliations of the employees. The function does not return any specific values in the provided output information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` that contains the characters 'D' and 'R'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string fractions of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
