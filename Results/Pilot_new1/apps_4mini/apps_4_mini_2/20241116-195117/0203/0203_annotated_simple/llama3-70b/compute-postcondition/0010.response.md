According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the string. At the end of the last iteration, the string `fractions` is non-empty, and the loop processes one character at a time.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The variable `fraction` will take the next character from the string `fractions`. 
2. Since `fractions` is non-empty, it will have at least one character left for the loop to execute again.
3. The current state of `depublicans` and `remocrats` will depend on the character that was processed in the last iteration, but since we are not given the exact character processed, we can only state that one of them has been increased based on the last character.

If `fractions` has a length of `n`, and if the loop has processed up to the `k-th` character, then for the loop to execute one more time, the state must reflect that `fraction` is the next character in the string, which would be the `(k+1)-th` character.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `fraction` is the next character in the string, while keeping `depublicans` and `remocrats` as they were after the last iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 0 or 1, `remocrats` is either 0 or 1**
