The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since `depublicans` can either be 1 or 2, the new value will be either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `fraction` is the next character in the string, `depublicans` is either 2 or 3, `remocrats` is either 0 or 1.
