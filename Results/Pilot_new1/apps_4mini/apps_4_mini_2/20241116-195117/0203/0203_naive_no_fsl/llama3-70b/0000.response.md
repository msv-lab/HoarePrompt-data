Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The voting process is not simply about counting the number of 'D' and 'R' characters; it involves a more complex interaction where employees can deny others from voting, and this can significantly affect the outcome.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
DRDRR
```

In this scenario, the optimal strategy would allow the first employee (D) to deny the second employee (R), and the third employee (D) to deny the fourth employee (R). The last employee (R) would then be the only one left, and they would win since they would be the last to vote. 

However, the program simply counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' and declares the one with the higher count as the winner. This approach fails to account for the voting dynamics and the strategic denial of votes.

Therefore, the program does not accurately reflect the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
