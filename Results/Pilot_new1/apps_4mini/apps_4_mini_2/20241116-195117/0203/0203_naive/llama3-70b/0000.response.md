Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the voting procedure as described in the problem. It simply counts the number of employees from each fraction and declares the winner based on which fraction has more members. However, the voting process involves denying employees the right to vote based on the order they make their statements, which can lead to scenarios where, despite having more members, one fraction could be eliminated entirely before the voting concludes.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this scenario, each employee can deny the next one in a way that could lead to all remocrats being denied the right to vote first, despite having an equal number of employees. The program fails to consider the dynamics of the voting process and simply counts the members, which does not guarantee the correct outcome. Thus, the program is incorrect.
