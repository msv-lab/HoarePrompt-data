According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will execute again as long as there are more characters in the `fractions` string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, which indicates that there are still characters left in `fractions`. Since `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `fraction` to be the next character in the string and `n` to reflect the number of remaining characters.

So, if `fraction` is currently the first character, after the next iteration, `fraction` will be the second character, and `n` will be decremented by 1 (assuming `n` represents the number of characters left). 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`**
