The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' (for down) and 'R' (for right). The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the analysis of the `fractions` string.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a string fractions of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
