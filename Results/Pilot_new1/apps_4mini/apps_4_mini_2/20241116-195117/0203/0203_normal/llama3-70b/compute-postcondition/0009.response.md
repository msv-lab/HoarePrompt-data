Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and remains 1, while `remocrats` stays at 0. If `fraction` is any character other than 'D', then `depublicans` remains 0 and `remocrats` is increased by 1, resulting in `remocrats` being 1.***
