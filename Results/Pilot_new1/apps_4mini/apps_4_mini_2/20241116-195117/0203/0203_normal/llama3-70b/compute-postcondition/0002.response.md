The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` and `fractions` remains unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, and `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, and `depublicans` is 0**
