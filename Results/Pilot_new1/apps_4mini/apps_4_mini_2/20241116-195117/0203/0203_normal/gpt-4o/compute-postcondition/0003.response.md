The variable `r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `r_queue` while keeping the other variables in their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
