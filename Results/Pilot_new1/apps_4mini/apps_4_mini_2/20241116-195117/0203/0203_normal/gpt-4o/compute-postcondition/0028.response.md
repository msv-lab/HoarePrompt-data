The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The previous state of `d_queue` is that it contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` with the first index removed, and `r_queue` is non-empty. After executing this line, `d_queue` will have one less element, and `d_index` will hold the value of the first index that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_queue` is still non-empty.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_queue` is still non-empty**
