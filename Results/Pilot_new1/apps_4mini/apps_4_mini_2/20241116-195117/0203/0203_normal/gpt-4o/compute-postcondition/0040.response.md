Output State: **`if n is at least 1 and both d_queue and r_queue are not empty, the loop will execute until one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if d_queue is empty, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were not paired with 'D' characters, and vice versa. If both queues are empty, all indices have been processed. If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and both d_queue and r_queue remain unchanged. If either d_queue or r_queue is empty at the start, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged.`**
