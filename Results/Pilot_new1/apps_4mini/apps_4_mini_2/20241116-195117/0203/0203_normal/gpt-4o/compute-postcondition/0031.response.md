The operation `r_queue.append(r_index + n)` appends a new value to `r_queue`. The value being appended is the result of `r_index + n`. Since `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `n` is an unknown variable, the resulting value that will be appended to `r_queue` is dependent on the specific value of `n`. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_queue` now has an additional value which is `r_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less index, `d_index` is the index that was at the front of `d_queue` before the pop operation, `r_index` is the value that was at the front of `r_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_queue` now has an additional value which is `r_index + n`.**
