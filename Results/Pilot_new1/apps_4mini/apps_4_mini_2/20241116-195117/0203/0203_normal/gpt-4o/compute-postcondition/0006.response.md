The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `v` is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and `v` is 'D'**
