Functionality: ** The function accepts input for a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes in a way that pairs indices of 'D' and 'R' based on their order. If there are remaining 'D' indices after processing, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `n` is 0, the function does not process any votes and will not output anything. The function does not handle any input validation or edge cases for invalid input types. **
