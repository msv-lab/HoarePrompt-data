Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is less than `n - 1`; `v` is the character at index `i + 1` in `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `i` is appended to `d_queue`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `v` is not 'D', then `i` is appended to `r_queue`, while `d_queue` remains unchanged.***
