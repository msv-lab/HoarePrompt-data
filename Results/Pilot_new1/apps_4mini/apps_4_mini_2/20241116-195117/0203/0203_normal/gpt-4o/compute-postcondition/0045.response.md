Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is not empty, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed. If `n` is at least 1 and both queues are empty, the output remains unchanged, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. If `n` is 0 or either queue is empty at the start, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged.***
