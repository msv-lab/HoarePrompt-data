The code appends `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The value of `d_index` is known as the first element removed from `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that affects the calculation. The state of `d_queue` will have one additional element after the execution of this code, which is `d_index + n`. The `r_queue` state is not directly affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, `d_queue` now has one additional element `d_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, `d_queue` now has one additional element `d_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`**.
