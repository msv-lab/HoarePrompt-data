Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed, and `d_queue` contains the remaining indices of 'D' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed, while `r_queue` consists of the remaining indices of 'R' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed. If both queues were previously empty, 'R' is printed, and both queues remain empty. If `n` is less than 1, both queues remain unchanged, and 'D' is printed if `d_queue` is non-empty or 'R' is printed if both queues are empty.***
