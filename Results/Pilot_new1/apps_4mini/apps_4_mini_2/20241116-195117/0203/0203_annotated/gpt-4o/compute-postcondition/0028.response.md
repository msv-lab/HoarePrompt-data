The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. As a result, `d_queue` now has one less element, and `r_queue` is either unchanged or has one additional element added. The specific values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_queue` are not provided, but we know their states based on the operation performed.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one less element, and `r_queue` has one less element or one additional element added.**
