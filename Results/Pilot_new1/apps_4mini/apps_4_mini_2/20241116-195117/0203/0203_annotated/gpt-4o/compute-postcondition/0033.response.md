According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`. The loop will continue as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `d_queue` has one less element than before, and `r_queue` has been updated based on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index`. For the loop to execute one more time, both queues need to have at least one element remaining.

Since `d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, we can infer that `d_queue` must have had at least 2 elements before the last iteration for it to still have at least 1 element now. Similarly, since `r_queue` has been modified based on the comparison with `r_index`, we need to ensure that it also has at least 1 element remaining.

Thus, we need to adjust the states to ensure that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` still contain elements.

State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element and `r_queue` has at least 1 element**
