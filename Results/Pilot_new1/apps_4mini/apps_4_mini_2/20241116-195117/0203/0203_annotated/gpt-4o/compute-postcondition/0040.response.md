Output State: **If `votes` is an empty string, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty, and the loop does not execute. If `d_queue` and `r_queue` are both non-empty, the loop will execute until either queue is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, then `r_queue` consists of the remaining indices of 'R' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed. If `r_queue` is empty, then `d_queue` consists of the remaining indices of 'D' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed. If both queues were non-empty, the loop will continue until one of the queues is empty, and the last executed values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last elements processed from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, respectively. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and both queues will remain unchanged.**
