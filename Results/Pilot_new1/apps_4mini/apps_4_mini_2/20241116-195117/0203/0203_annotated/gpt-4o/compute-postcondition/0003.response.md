The variable `r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The previous values of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' only; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.
