Output State: **`votes` is an empty string or `d_queue` is non-empty; if `d_queue` is non-empty, the loop has executed with `d_queue` containing indices of 'D' characters, and `r_queue` may be empty or non-empty; the last executed value of `d_index` corresponds to the last processed index from `d_queue`; if `r_queue` is non-empty, it consists of the remaining indices of 'R' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed; if `r_queue` is empty, then `d_queue` consists of the remaining indices of 'D' characters, each incremented by `n` for those that were processed; if `n` is less than 1, both queues remain unchanged; and 'D' is printed.**
