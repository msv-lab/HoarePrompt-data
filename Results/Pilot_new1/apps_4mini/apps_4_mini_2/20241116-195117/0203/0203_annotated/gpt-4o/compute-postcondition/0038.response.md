Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, with `d_index + n` appended, while `r_queue` remains one element less than before. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `d_queue` has one less element, and `r_queue` has one more element with `r_index + n` appended. In all cases, `d_index` retains the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, and `r_index` retains the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.***
