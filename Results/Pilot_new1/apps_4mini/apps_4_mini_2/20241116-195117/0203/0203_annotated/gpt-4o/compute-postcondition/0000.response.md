The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected by this line. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' only.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' only**
