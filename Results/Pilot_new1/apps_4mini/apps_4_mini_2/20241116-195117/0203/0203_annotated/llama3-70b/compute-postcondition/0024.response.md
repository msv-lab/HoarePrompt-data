Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the output is 'D'. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the output is 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and the output will be 'R' since 0 is less than or equal to 0.***
