Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is either 1 or 0, and `remocrats` is either 0 or 1. If the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1, resulting in `depublicans` being 1 and `remocrats` remaining 0. If the first character of `fractions` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1, resulting in `depublicans` being 0 and `remocrats` being 1.***
