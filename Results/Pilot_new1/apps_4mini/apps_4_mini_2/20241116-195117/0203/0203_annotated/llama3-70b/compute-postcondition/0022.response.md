Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.***
