Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer in the range (-10^9, 10^9), `s` is a user-provided binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This covers the cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a potential division by zero, and ensures that the output reflects the relationship between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`.***
