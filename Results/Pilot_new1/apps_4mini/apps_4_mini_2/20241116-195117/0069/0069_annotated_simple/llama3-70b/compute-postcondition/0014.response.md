Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer in the range (-10^9, 10^9), `s` is a user-provided binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the output is -1. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, it ensures that the function handles the potential division by zero appropriately. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, reflecting the relationship between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`.***
