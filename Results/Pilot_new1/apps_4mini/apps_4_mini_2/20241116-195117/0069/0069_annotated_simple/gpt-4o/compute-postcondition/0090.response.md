According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`, meaning it will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop will not execute again unless `i` is incremented. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`. The state of `prefix_balances` is already updated based on `s[i - 1]`, so no further adjustments to that variable are necessary.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[n]`, `i` is n + 1**
