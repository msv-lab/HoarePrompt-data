Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, with the last value being 0. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` is updated to include `count`. The integrity of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged throughout the execution.***
