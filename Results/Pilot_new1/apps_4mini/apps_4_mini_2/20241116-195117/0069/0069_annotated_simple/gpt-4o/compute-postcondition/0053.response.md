According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop is set to iterate from `1` to `n + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` with all elements as `0`. Given that `i` is currently at the value of `n`, the next iteration would require `i` to be `n + 1` for it to terminate properly. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to `n + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `prefix_balances` remains unchanged and still meets the required conditions for the loop.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` with all elements as 0; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`; `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`**
