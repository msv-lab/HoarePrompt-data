Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the difference between `x` and `b` is a multiple of `balance` and non-negative. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
