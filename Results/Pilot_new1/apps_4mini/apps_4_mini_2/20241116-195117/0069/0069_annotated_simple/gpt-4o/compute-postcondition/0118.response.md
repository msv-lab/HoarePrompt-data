According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop will only execute if `results` contains at least one element. Additionally, since the loop iterates over `results`, it is important to ensure that `results` is not empty.

Before the loop starts, the conditions for `results` to contain elements must be satisfied. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1, which means `results` will not be empty. If `balance` is not 0, the count of elements satisfying the specified conditions must be greater than 0 for `results` to contain elements.

Furthermore, if `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and if `T` is less than 1, the outer loop does not execute, leading to `results` being empty.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `results` has at least one element. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `results` is not empty.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `results` is not empty, `balance` is either 0 or a non-zero value that leads to a non-empty `results`**
