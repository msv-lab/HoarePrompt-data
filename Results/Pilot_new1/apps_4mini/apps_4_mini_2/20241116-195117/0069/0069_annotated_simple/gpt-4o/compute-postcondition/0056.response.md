Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s` up to the `i-th` index, with `prefix_balances[0]` remaining 0. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of size `1` with all elements as 0. If `n` is at least 1, the values of `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` will be computed based on the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`.**
