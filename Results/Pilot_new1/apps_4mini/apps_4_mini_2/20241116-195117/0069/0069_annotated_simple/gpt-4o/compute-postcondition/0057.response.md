Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and the cumulative balance `balance` is equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, then the values of `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` are computed based on the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`.***
