The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and its previous value is 0. Therefore, after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `b`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`**
