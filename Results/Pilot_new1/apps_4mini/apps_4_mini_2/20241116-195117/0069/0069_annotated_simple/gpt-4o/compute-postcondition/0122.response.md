According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. The loop will execute as long as there are more elements in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least one more element, which indicates that there are still elements left to iterate over. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to account for the fact that `result` will take on the next element in the `results` list. Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, we can infer that `result` should be updated to the next element in the list.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there is one less element in `results` after the last iteration, and `result` should be the next element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `results` has at least one more element, `balance` is either 0 or a non-zero value that leads to a non-empty `results`, `result` is the next element in the results list**
