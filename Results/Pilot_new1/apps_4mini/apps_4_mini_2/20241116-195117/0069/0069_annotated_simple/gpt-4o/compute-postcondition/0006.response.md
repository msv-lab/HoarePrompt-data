The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `index` is 1, so `data[index]` refers to the second element of the `data` list. Since `n` is a positive integer, it will take the integer value of that element. The other variables (`T`, `x`, `results`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `x` is an integer, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer from `data[1]`, `x` is an integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
