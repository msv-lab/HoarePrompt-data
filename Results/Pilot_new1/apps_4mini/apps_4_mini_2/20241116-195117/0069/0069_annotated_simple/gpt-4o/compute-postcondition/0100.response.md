Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the net count of '0's minus '1's from the start of the string up to the i-th character. The value of `balance` is not equal to 0, indicating that there is a net excess of either '0's or '1's in the analyzed portion of the string. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros; otherwise, it has been updated through the loop execution.***
