According to the code, the loop executes based on the variable `T`, which represents the number of iterations. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that we are currently on the last iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be incremented by one, indicating that there is an additional iteration to process.

Since the loop executes `T` times and the current iteration is the last one, we need to adjust `T` to be greater than the current iteration count. There are no other states mentioned that need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, with the last value being 0, `T` is greater than the current iteration count**
