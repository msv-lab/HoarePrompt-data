The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so we can only state that `count` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable; `count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable; `count` is incremented by 1**
