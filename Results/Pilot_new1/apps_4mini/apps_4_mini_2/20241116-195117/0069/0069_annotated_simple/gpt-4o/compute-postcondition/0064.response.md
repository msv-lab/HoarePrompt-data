The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The initial state mentions that `prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where the first element is 0, and `balance` is not equal to 0. The state of `prefix_balances` and `balance` is not directly affected by the assignment of `count`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the addition of the initialized value of `count`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0; `balance` is not equal to 0; `count` is 0**
