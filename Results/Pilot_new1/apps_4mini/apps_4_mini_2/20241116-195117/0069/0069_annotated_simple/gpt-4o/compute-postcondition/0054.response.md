The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either 1 or -1, depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known, and it will either increase or decrease based on the character in `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
