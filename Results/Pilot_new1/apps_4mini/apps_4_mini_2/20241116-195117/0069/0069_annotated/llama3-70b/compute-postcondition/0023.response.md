Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 1, `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the function prints -1, indicating that the balance cannot be adjusted. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the adjustment needed based on the difference between `x` and `balance` divided by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. This accounts for all cases, including when `cnt0` equals `cnt1` and when it does not.***
