According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `T` must be greater than 0 since it determines the number of iterations. Given that `T` is a positive integer, it is already within the range of 1 to 100. Additionally, the loop will execute `T` times. However, we need to ensure that `T` has been assigned a value from the input before the loop starts. 

Thus, we can conclude that `T` should be a positive integer, and since the loop starts at 0, we can set the loop iteration variable to 0 (indicating the first iteration).

State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0**
