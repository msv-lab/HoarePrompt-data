The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. It does not change the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed value.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0, `n`, `x`, `s` are input values, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, the balance (cnt0 - cnt1) is not equal to `x`, and the difference (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), and the function prints -1**.
