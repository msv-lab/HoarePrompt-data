Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `_` is 0, `n`, `x`, `s` are input values, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and the balance (cnt0 - cnt1) is not equal to `x`. If the difference (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. This captures all edge cases where the divisibility condition or the balance condition affects the output.***
