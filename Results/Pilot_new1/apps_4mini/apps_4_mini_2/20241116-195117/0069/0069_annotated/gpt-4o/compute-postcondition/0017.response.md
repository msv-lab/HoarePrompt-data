The code updates `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i - 1]` corresponds to `prefix_balances[n]`. The value added to `prefix_balances[i]` is `1` if `s[i - 1]` is `'0'`, otherwise it is `-1`. 

Given the initial state, the exact value of `prefix_balances[n]` and the character `s[n - 1]` are not specified, but we know that `n` is at least 1, so `i` will be at least 2.

The output state reflects the updated value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on the previous balance and the character at `s[i - 1]`. Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and `s[n - 1]`, where `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is at least 1**
