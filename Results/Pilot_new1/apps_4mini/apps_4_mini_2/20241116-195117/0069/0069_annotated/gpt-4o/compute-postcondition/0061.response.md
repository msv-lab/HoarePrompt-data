The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is `0`, and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. The appending operation does not affect these variables; it only modifies the `results` list by adding a new element. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional element `0`.**
