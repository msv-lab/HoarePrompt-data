Precondition: **T is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100) representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and x (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), followed by a binary string s of length n (s_i âˆˆ {0, 1}). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
