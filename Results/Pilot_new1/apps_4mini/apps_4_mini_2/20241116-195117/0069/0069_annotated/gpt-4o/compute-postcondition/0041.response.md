Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` containing cumulative balances of '0's and '1's from the string `s`. If `balance` is 0, if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; otherwise, it includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and `results` is updated with this count. In all cases, `prefix_balances` retains its original size of `n + 1`.***
