According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4. We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to still be valid.

Since `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, we can infer that `n` must be at least 3 for `i` to have a valid next value of 4. However, we have no information about the specific value of `n` besides it being at least 3. Therefore, we adjust `n` to be at least 4 to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, initialized with zeros; `i` is 4; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `prefix_balances[3]` is either `prefix_balances[2] + 1` or `prefix_balances[2] - 1`; `n` is at least 4**
