The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the variables are not affected by this operation. The state of `prefix_balances` and `balance` remains unchanged, but the `results` list is modified to include `-1`. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, and `results` now includes -1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, and `results` now includes -1**
