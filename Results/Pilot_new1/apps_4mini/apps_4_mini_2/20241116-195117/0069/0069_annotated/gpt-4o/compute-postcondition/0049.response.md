According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `n + 1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

Given that `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros, it implies that `n` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
