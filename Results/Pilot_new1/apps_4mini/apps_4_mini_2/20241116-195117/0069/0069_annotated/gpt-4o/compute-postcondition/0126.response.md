The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `T`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it consists of two integers `n` and `x`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the length of a binary string and `x` is an integer that can range from -10^9 to 10^9. Additionally, it takes a binary string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The total sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function processes these test cases and returns results based on the input parameters. However, the specific output behavior is not described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer T representing the number of test cases, each consisting of two integers n and x, and a binary string s of length n. The function processes the test cases based on these inputs.**
