Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of size at least 2, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition was satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, `count` remains 0.***
