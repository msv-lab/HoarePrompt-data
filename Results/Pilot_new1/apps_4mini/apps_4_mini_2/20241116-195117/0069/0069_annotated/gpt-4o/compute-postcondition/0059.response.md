The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified in the initial state, but we know that `results` is modified by adding `-1` to it. The other variables (`prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1**
