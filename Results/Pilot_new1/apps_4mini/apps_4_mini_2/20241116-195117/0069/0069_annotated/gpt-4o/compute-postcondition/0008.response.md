The variable `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so `index + 2` equals 3. The variable `s` is now set to `data[3]`. The previous values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `T` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value from `data[1]`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is assigned the value from `data[1]`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
