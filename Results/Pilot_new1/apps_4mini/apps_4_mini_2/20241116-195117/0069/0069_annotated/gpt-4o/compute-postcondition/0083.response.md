The value of `index` is incremented by 3, which affects the current position in the `data` list but does not change the values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `results`, `T`, `n`, `x`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `index` has been updated.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized with cumulative balances based on string `s`, `balance` is determined by these balances, `results` contains the previous values, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is incremented by 3.**
