The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list containing `n + 1` zeros. The previous values of `prefix_balances` are unchanged, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `prefix_balances` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `results` is unchanged, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is increased by 3, and `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')**.
