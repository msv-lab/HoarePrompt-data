Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones up to index `n`, `results` is updated to include -1 if `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, or has an additional element `0` if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. In both cases, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is increased by 3, and `balance` remains equal to 0, indicating that the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s` are equal.***
