According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, which is `n`, since the loop starts from 1 and goes to `n + 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n + 1`, but since the loop's condition is `i < n + 1`, this means that the loop cannot execute again with the current state. Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is set to `n + 1` for the loop to be able to start the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character `s[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
