Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones up to index `n`, `results` remains unchanged, `T` is greater than the previous count of iterations, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the count of '0's is equal to the count of '1's in the string `s`, and `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`.***
