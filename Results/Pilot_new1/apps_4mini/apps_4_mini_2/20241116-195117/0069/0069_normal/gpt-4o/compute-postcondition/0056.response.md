Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where each '0' increases the balance by 1 and each '1' decreases it by 1. After the loop executes `n` times, `prefix_balances[n]` is the final balance, and `i` will be `n`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.**
