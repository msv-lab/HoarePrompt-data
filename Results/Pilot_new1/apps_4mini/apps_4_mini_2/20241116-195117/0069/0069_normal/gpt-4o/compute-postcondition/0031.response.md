Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 1, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true, where `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
