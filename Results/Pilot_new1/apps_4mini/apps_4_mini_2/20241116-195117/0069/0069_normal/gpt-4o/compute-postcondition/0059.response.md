The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `results` has been modified.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing cumulative balances, `balance` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains -1 appended to it.**
