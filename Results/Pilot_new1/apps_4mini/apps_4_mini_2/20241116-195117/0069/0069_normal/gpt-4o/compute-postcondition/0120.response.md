According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least two elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least one valid prefix balance, `result` is the first element of `results`, and `index` is 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least two elements, and `result` should be the second element in the list, while `index` should be adjusted to 1.

State: **`results` contains at least 2 valid prefix balances, `result` is the second element of `results`, `index` is 1**
