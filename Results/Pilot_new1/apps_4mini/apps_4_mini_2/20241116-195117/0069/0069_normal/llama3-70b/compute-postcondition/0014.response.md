Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, representing the number of operations required to achieve the desired balance between the counts of '0's and '1's. This ensures all edge cases regarding the relationship between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` are considered.***
