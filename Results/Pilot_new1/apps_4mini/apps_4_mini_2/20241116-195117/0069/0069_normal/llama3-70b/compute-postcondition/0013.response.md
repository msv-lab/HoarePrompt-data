Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then `-1` is printed. Otherwise, the result of the print statement is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, indicating the number of additional operations needed to balance the counts of '0's and '1's based on the given values.***
