Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, provided that `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, it implies that `balance` is 0, and the behavior of the program should be defined accordingly, potentially leading to an undefined or error state if `x` does not equal `balance`.***
