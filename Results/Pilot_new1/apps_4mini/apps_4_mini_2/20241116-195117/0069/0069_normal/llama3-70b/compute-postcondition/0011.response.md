Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the difference `(x - balance)` is not divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` or `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` (if `cnt0 - cnt1` is zero).***
