The values of `n` and `x` are assigned new values based on the input provided, where `input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into components, and `map(int, ...)` converts those components into integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are overwritten, but the specific new values are not known as they depend on the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer (new value from input), `x` is an integer (new value from input), `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
