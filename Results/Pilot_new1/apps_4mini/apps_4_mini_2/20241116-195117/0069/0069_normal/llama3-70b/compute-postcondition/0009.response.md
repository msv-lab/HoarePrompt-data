Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `balance` is not equal to `x`. The difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`.***
