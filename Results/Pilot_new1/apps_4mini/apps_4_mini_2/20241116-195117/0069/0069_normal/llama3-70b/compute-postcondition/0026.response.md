The values of `n` and `x` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` accepts input and `map` converts the split input into integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not known, as they are being assigned new values based on user input. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
