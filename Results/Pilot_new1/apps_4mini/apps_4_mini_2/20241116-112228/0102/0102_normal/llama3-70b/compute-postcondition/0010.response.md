The code constructs a string representation of the integer `s` based on its tens and ones places. It uses the `tens`, `ones`, and `teens` lists to map the numeric values to their corresponding English words. The value of `s` is an integer between 20 and 99. 

1. The tens place of `s` is calculated using `s // 10`, which gives the index for the `tens` list.
2. The ones place of `s` is calculated using `s % 10`, which gives the index for the `ones` list.
3. If the ones place is 0, it means that `s` is a multiple of 10, and thus no ones place word is appended.
4. If the ones place is not 0, a hyphen followed by the corresponding word from the `ones` list is appended.

Given that `s` is an input integer satisfying `20 ≤ s ≤ 99`, the output will be a string that represents the number in words.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, and the output is the English word representation of `s`.**
