Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the output is the corresponding string from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), the output is the corresponding string from `teens` based on `s`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is formatted as a combination of the appropriate string from `tens` and `ones`, separated by a hyphen if `s` is not a multiple of 10.***
