Postcondition: ***If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string representation from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format of either the tens place from the `tens` list if `n` is a multiple of 10, or a combination of the tens place and the ones place from the `ones` list if `n` is not a multiple of 10. For values of `n` less than 10 or greater than 99, the function does not execute any return statement, leading to undefined behavior.***
