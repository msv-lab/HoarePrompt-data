The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation for values from 0 to 99. It returns 'zero' for 0, the corresponding string from the `ones` list for values from 1 to 9, strings from the `teens` list for values from 11 to 19, and a combination of the `tens` and `ones` lists for values from 20 to 99. However, it does not handle the case for `n` equal to 10, and for any values less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value, leading to undefined behavior.
