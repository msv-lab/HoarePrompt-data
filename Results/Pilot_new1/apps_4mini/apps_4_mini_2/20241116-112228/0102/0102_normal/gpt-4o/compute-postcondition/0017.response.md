Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string representation from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99, it returns the string representation of `s` in the format of the tens place from the `tens` list if `s` is a multiple of 10, or a combination of the tens place and the ones place from the `ones` list if `s` is not a multiple of 10. For values of `s` equal to 10 or outside the range of 0 to 99, the function does not execute any return statement, leading to undefined behavior.***
