Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts an integer score (between 0 and 99) into its corresponding English words representation according to the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the code handles the different ranges of input:

1. **For scores from 0 to 9**: The program uses the `ones` list to directly map the integer to its corresponding word (e.g., 6 to "six").

2. **For scores from 10 to 19**: The program uses the `teens` list to convert these scores into words (e.g., 15 to "fifteen").

3. **For scores from 20 to 99**: The program calculates the tens and ones separately. It uses the `tens` list to get the word for the tens place (e.g., 20 to "twenty") and checks if there are any ones to append. If there are, it concatenates a hyphen and the corresponding word from the `ones` list (e.g., 23 to "twenty-three").

The program handles all specified cases correctly, including edge cases like 0 ("zero") and 99 ("ninety-nine"). Since the logic correctly covers all possible inputs in the specified range, the program is deemed correct.
