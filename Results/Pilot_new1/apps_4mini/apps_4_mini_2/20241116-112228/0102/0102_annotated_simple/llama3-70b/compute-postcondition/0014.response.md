Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input from the user. It prints the English word representation of the integer if it is between 0 and 99. For numbers less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list; for numbers between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list; and for numbers 20 and above, it combines the appropriate words from the `tens` and `ones` lists, using a hyphen if necessary. However, the function does not handle numbers outside the range of 0 to 99, nor does it validate the input, which could lead to errors if the input is not an integer.**
