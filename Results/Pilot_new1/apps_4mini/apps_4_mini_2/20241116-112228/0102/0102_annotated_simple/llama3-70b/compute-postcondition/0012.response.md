Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string representation of `s` from the `ones` array. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` array. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` in words, combining the appropriate values from the `tens` and `ones` arrays, with a hyphen included if `s` has a non-zero ones place.***
