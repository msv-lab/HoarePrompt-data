Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation from the `ones` list corresponding to `n`. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, and `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` formatted as "tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]". Cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99 are not handled and thus do not affect the output.***
