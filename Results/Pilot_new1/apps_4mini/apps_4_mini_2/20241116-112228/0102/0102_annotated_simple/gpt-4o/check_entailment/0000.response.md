To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code and consider all potential input cases based on the problem description.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n)` is designed to convert an integer score `n` (where `0 ≤ n ≤ 99`) into its English word representation. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Handling numbers from 0 to 9**:
   - If `n` is between `0` and `9`, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.

2. **Handling numbers from 11 to 19**:
   - If `n` is between `11` and `19`, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list.

3. **Handling tens and numbers from 10 to 99**:
   - If `n` is between `10` and `99`, it checks if `n` is a multiple of `10`:
     - If it is, it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list.
     - If it is not, it combines the word from the `tens` list (for the tens place) with the word from the `ones` list (for the units place) separated by a hyphen.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles all values from `0` to `99`:
  - For `0`, it returns "zero".
  - For `1` to `9`, it returns "one" to "nine".
  - For `10`, it returns "ten".
  - For `11` to `19`, it returns "eleven" to "nineteen".
  - For `20`, it returns "twenty".
  - For `21` to `29`, it returns "twenty-one" to "twenty-nine".
  - For `30`, it returns "thirty", and so on, up to `99`, which returns "ninety-nine".

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement, handling all specified cases without missing any potential inputs within the defined range.

Correctness: **True** 

The program effectively covers all numbers from `0` to `99` and outputs their correct English representations, adhering strictly to the problem requirements.
