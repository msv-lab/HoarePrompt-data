The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English word representation for values between 0 and 99. For values 0-9, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For values 11-19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For multiples of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list. For non-multiples of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns a formatted string combining the word from the `tens` list and the word from the `ones` list. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, which may lead to unexpected behavior for those inputs.
