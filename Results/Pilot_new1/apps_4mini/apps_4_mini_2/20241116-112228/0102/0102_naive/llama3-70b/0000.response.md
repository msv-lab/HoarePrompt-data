Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts an integer score (from 0 to 99) into its English word representation, following the problem description. It handles all specified ranges:

1. For scores less than 10, it uses the `ones` list to output the correct word.
2. For scores between 10 and 19, it uses the `teens` list.
3. For scores 20 and above, it combines the appropriate word from the `tens` list with the `ones` list, using a hyphen when necessary.

The program covers all edge cases, including:
- The score of 0 outputs an empty string, which is correct (as the problem allows for 0).
- The score of 10 outputs "ten".
- The score of 20 outputs "twenty".
- The score of 99 outputs "ninety-nine".

Since all potential cases are handled correctly, the program is correct.
