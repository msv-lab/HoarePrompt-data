The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `s` from the user. It prints the English word representation of `s` if it is between 0 and 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it formats the output using both the `tens` and `ones` lists, separating them with a hyphen if necessary. The function does not handle negative integers or integers greater than 99, which could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.
