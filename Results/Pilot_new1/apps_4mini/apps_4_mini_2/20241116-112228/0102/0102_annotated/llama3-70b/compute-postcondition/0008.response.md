The value of `s` is an integer between 10 and 19 (inclusive). The expression `teens[s - 10]` accesses the `teens` list at the index corresponding to `s - 10`. Since `s` is at least 10, `s - 10` ranges from 0 to 9, which are valid indices for the `teens` list. Therefore, the output will be a string representation of the number corresponding to `s`.

The output state will reflect the values of `s` and the string retrieved from the `teens` list based on the value of `s`. Since `s` is not specified, we will denote it as a variable.

Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10 and less than 20; the printed value is `teens[s - 10]`**
