Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), it prints the corresponding string representation from the `teens` list at index `s - 10`. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints a formatted string representing `s` as tens and ones, where the tens are derived from the `tens` list and the ones from the `ones` list, with a hyphen separating them if `s` is not a multiple of ten. The function does not handle negative integers or integers greater than 99, which could lead to potential errors or unexpected behavior.***
