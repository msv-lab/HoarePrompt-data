The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representation of `s` in the format 'tens-ones' for non-multiples of ten, or just the string representation of the tens place if `s` is a multiple of 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `s` in the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation based on the specified conditions for different ranges of `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, and returns the string representation of `s` based on its value: corresponding string from `ones` if `s` is between 0 and 9, corresponding string from `teens` if `s` is between 11 and 19, or 'tens-ones' format for values between 10 and 99.**
