According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, which means it is at least 1. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be incremented to allow for another iteration. As the loop runs `n` times, for it to execute again, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than the current value. 

Since the loop variable is not used in the loop body (indicated by the underscore `_`), the states that need to be adjusted are only concerning `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d)]**
