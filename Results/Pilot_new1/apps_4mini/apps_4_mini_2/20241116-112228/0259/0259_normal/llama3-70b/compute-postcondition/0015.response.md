According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list contains at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is `float('inf')` and `ans` is -1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `buses` list must have at least 1 tuple, and the index `i` should start at 0, with `(s, d)` being the first tuple in the list.

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is float('inf'), `ans` is -1**
