Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated as `(t - s) % d` for the bus that has the earliest next departure time, `ans` is the index (1-based) of that bus in the `buses` list. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains `float('inf')`, and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains tuples but all `time` values are greater than or equal to `min_time` for every bus, `min_time` and `ans` will remain unchanged from their initial values.**
