The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input, which will be converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now assigned integer values based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d)] where s and d are input integers**
