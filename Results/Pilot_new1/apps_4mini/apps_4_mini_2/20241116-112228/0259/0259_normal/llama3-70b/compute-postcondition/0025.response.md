Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `(s, d)` is the second tuple in the list. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
