According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 at the end of the last iteration, it indicates that the loop has executed at least once. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the number of iterations that have already occurred.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still greater than 0, but it needs to be adjusted to reflect that one iteration has been completed. Therefore, `n` should be decreased by 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted as neither `t` nor `buses` are affected by the loop iteration count.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is now `[(s, d), (s, d)]**
