The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the start time and the interval of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes (`n` is 0), the function will return -1, indicating no available routes.
