To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided and how it interacts with the initial state.

1. The variables `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are defined in the initial state with the following constraints:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\)
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\)
   - `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`
   - `i` is assigned the value of `n`

2. The code calculates `wait_time` as follows:
   - `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`

3. The calculation of `wait_time` depends on the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. Since these values are not explicitly provided, we can only describe `wait_time` in terms of the variables involved.

After evaluating the code's impact, the output state can be summarized as:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 to 100)
- `t` is a positive integer (1 to 100000)
- `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from `bus_routes[n]`
- `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 to 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 to 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
