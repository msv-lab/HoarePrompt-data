The code assigns the values of the tuple `bus_routes[i]` to `s_i` and `d_i`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100. Therefore, `s_i` and `d_i` will be assigned the values from the `bus_routes` list at index `n`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
