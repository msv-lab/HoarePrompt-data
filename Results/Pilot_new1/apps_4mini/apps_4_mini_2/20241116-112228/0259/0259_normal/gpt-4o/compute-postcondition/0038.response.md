Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum waiting time calculated based on the bus routes, and `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If `n` is at least 1, `min_wait_time` will be updated to a non-negative integer representing the least wait time for the given bus schedule, while `chosen_route` reflects the route index associated with that wait time. The loop ensures that all scenarios are accounted for, including cases where buses depart after or at time `t`, arrive exactly at time `t`, or the next bus arrives after time `t`.**
