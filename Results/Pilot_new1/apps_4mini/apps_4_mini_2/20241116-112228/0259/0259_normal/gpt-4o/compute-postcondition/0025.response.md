The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `chosen_route`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `chosen_route` is assigned based on the increment of `i` by 1.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time` based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`; `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1**
