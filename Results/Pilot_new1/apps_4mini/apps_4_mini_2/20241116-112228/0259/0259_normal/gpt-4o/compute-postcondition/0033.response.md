Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time to wait until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This ensures all scenarios are covered, including when `t` is less than, equal to, or greater than `s_i`, as well as when the bus schedule aligns perfectly with `t` or requires waiting.***
