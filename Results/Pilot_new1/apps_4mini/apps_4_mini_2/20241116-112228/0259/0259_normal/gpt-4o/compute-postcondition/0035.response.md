The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. However, the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `chosen_route` will depend on the value of `i`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1**
