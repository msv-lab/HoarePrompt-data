According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its maximum value of `n - 1` (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which means the loop will no longer execute again.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is to reflect that the loop has completed all iterations. Since `i` is at its maximum value, it should be set to `n` to indicate that the loop has finished executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, `i` is `n`**
