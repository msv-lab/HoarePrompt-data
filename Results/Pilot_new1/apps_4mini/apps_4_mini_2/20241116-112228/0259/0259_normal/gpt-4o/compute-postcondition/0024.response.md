The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`. However, without specific values for `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`, the exact value of `wait_time` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`, but we cannot specify its value.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time` based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`**
