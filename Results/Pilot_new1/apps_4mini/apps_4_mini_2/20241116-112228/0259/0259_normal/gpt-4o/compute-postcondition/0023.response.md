Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, indicating the waiting time until the bus departs. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, meaning the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. In the case where `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not zero, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`, ensuring that `wait_time` is a non-negative integer in all scenarios.***
