Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[2]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time to wait until the next bus arrives based on the schedule. The value of `wait_time` is always non-negative, as it accounts for the remainder of the division operation.***
