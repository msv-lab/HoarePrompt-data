The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is 0.
