The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. Since the specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided, the output state reflects that `min_wait_time` is set to the current value of `wait_time`, which is derived from the previously described logic.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time` based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.**
