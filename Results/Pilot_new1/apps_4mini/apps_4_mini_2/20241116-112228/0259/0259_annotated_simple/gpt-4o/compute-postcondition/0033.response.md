Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[2]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always non-negative, as it represents the time until the next bus arrives based on the schedule. The calculations handle all edge cases for the timing of bus arrivals.***
