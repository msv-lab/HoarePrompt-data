Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `chosen_route` is 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[2]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. This ensures that the minimum wait time reflects the shortest wait until the next bus, considering all edge cases for bus arrival times are properly handled. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` retains its previous value.***
