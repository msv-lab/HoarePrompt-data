Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `chosen_route` is 2. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` retains its previous value of 2. Additionally, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions given, ensuring it is non-negative and respects the boundaries defined by `min_wait_time`.***
