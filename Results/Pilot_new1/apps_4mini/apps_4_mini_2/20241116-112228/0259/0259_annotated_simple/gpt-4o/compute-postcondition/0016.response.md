Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`. The `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` (which is 1 in this case) if the condition is satisfied. The value of `wait_time` is a positive integer reflecting the calculated wait time for the next bus based on the conditions of `s_i` and `d_i`, ensuring that all scenarios, including edge cases where `s_i` equals `t` or is very close to it, are appropriately handled. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
