The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `min_wait_time`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1**
