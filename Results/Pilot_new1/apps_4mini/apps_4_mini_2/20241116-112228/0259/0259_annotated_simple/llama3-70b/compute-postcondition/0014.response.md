The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `-1`. The previous state of other variables, including `buses`, `t`, and `min_time`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `buses` contains `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are input integers; `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000; `min_time` is set to infinity (float('inf')); `ans` is -1.
