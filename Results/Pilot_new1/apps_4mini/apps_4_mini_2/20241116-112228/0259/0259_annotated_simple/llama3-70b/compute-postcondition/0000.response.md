The values of `n` and `t` are assigned from the input, where `input()` accepts a string that is split into two parts and converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The specific values of `n` and `t` are not provided, but they are constrained by the conditions given (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 100000). Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `t` are now assigned integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000**
