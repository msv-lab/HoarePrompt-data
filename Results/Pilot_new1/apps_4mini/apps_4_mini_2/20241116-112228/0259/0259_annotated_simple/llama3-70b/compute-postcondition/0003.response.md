The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `buses` is an empty list. The values of `s` and `d` are not previously defined, and their specific values depend on user input. Therefore, the output state reflects the input requirement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers.**
