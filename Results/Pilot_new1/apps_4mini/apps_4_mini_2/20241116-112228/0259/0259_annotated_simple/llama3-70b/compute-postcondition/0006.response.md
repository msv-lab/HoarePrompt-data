The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `s` and `d` are not specified, but they will be replaced by the new input values. The states of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now set to the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are input integers**
