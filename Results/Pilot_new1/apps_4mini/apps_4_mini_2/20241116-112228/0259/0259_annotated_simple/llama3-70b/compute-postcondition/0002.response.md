According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, which means `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start. The variable `t` is not directly affecting the loop execution, but it is within the defined bounds. Since `buses` is an empty list, it does not impact the loop execution either. 

At the start of the loop, the loop variable is typically not defined until the loop begins, but since the loop does not make use of a loop variable in this case (indicated by the underscore `_`), we can treat it as not needing initialization. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `n` is initialized correctly and that it is at least 1. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
