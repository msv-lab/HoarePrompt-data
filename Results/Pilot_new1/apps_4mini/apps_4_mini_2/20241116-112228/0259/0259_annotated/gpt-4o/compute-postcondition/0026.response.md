Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. All variables maintain their relationships as defined in the precondition, ensuring that `wait_time` accurately reflects the computed wait time based on the bus schedule and current time.***
