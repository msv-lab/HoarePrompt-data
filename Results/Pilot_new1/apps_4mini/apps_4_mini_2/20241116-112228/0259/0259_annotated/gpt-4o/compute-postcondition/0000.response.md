The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that `min_wait_time` is initialized to represent the maximum possible wait time, which will be used to compare against actual wait times later in the program. The other variables `n` and `t` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf')**
