The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, but `chosen_route` will be one more than whatever `i` is. The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `wait_time`, and `min_wait_time`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `chosen_route` and `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` is calculated based on the bus schedule, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
