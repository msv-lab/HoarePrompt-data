Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus schedules for the routes evaluated, and `chosen_route` is the index of the route with the shortest wait time (1-based index). If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all routes have a wait time greater than or equal to the initial `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.**
