Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5). If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, and `min_wait_time` is updated if `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `n`, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, and `min_wait_time` is updated if this new `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, with `chosen_route` updated to `n`, and `s_i` and `d_i` assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. In either case, the program ensures that `min_wait_time` reflects the minimum wait time based on the calculated `wait_time`.***
