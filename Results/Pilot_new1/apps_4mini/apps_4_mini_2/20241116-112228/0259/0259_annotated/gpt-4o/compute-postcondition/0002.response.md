According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `n` is already defined as a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. 

The loop variable `i` will start at 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0.

Given that the other variables (`t`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) do not affect the loop's execution directly, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
