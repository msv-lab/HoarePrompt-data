Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is a non-negative float, `chosen_route` is updated based on the shortest wait time, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is non-negative and reflects the next bus arrival based on the current time `t` and the schedule defined by `s_i` and `d_i`.***
