The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of bus routes, constrained between 1 and 100.
- `t` is a positive integer that indicates the total number of buses, constrained between 1 and 100,000.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i`, representing the start and destination of each bus route, with constraints that both `s_i` and `d_i` are between 1 and 100,000.

After executing the function body, it returns the index of the route with the shortest wait time, referred to as `chosen_route`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the bus route that has the shortest wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (total number of buses), and bus_routes (list of bus routes defined by start and destination), and returns the index of the route with the shortest wait time.**
