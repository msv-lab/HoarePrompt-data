Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is updated if `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is updated to `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
