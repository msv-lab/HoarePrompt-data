Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0]. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is the non-negative value of `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not zero, then `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time to wait for the next bus after `t`.***
