The line of code `min_wait_time = wait_time` assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The previous value of `min_wait_time` is not specified, but it will now hold the value of `wait_time`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` is calculated based on the bus schedule, and `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `wait_time` is calculated based on the bus schedule, and `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time**
