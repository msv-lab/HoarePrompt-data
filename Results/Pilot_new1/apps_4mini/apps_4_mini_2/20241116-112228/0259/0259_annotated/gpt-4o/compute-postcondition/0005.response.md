The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, which means `wait_time` will be a non-negative value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0], `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0], `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative value.**
