The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous value of `min_wait_time` is not specified, but it is indicated that `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, meaning that `wait_time` is a new optimal value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0].
