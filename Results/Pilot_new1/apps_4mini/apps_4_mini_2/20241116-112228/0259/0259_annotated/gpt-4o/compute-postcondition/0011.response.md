Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are values from bus_routes[0] with `s_i` less than `t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus is arriving exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time to wait for the next bus after `t`.***
