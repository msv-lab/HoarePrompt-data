The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), and `chosen_route` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^5), `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), and `chosen_route` is -1**
