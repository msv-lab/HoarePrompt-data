The code appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the list `buses`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation, and the previous values of `s` and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 100; `s` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; and a tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 100; `s` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; and a tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses.**
