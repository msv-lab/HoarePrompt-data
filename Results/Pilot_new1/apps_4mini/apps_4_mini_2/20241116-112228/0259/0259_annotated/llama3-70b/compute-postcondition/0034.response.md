The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it operates based on certain constraints related to positive integers. It is designed to handle a positive integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 100) and a positive integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 100000). Additionally, for each bus route, there are two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` (where 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000). 

The output of the function is based on the defined constraints and relationships of the inputs. However, the specific return values or functionality based on these inputs have not been provided.

Functionality: **The function operates on the constraints of positive integers n, t, s_i, and d_i, but does not accept any parameters directly. The exact return value or output based on these constraints is not specified.**
