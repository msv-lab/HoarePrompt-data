The function reads two integers, `n` and `t`, from user input, where `n` is the number of buses and `t` is a time value. It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and duration for each bus, storing them in a list. The function calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on the formula `(t - s) % d` and returns the 1-based index of the bus with the minimum wait time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it outputs `-1`. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.
