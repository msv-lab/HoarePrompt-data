The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by mapping the input values to integers. The input function will accept two space-separated integers, which will be assigned to `s` and `d`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is greater than 100, it does not affect `s` or `d`. The values of `s` and `d` will depend on the user input, which is not specified here. Therefore, the output state will reflect the potential assignment of `s` and `d` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 100; `s` and `d` are input integers**
