Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple of integers `(s, d)`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1` (which is 1 when `i` is 0). If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. In all cases, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`.***
