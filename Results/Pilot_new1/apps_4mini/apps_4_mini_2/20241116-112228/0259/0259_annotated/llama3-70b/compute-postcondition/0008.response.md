According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than the current iteration count. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 100, which means it is at least 101 or more. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the current iteration count, which will be 1 after the first iteration. Therefore, `n` should remain greater than 100, and the loop iteration count will increment by 1.

No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is greater than 100; `s` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; and a tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses.**
