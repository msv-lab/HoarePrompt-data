The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The variables `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `t`, along with the new state of the `buses` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
