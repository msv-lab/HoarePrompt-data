The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `buses` contains `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)`, where `n` is 0; `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` contains `n` tuples of integers `(s, d)`, where `n` is 0; `min_time` is float('inf'), and `ans` is -1**
