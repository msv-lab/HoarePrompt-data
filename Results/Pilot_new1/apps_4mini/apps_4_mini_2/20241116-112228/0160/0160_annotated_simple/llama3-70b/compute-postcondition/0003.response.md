According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `N-1`. This means that for the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied as per the given state (2 <= N <= 500). 

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1, as it starts from 1. The variable `gcd` is initialized to `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. Since `A` is guaranteed to have `N` integers, `A[0]` is valid.

Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop executes are that `i` starts at 1 and `gcd` is initialized to `A[0]`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers, `gcd` is A[0], `i` is 1**
