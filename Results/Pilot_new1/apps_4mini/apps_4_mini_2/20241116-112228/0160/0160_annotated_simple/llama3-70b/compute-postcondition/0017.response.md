Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or greater than `gcd`, `i` is 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of N integers. If the product of `i` and `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
