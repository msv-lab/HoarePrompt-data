According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` has been incremented by 1. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the relationship between `i` and `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `i` has been incremented by 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` must now be at most `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. This means that `gcd` must be such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least `i + 1`. 

Therefore, we can conclude that `gcd` must be adjusted to be at least `(i + 1) ** 2` to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`gcd` is at least `(i + 1) ** 2`, `i` is `i + 1`**
