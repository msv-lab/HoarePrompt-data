Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i` if `gcd % i == 0`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A` remain the same, with `N` being an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, and `K` being a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9.***
