The values of `N` and `K` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input will provide two integers, one for `N` and one for `K`. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not specified, but they must adhere to the constraints given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `N` and `K` are now assigned values based on the input, while the list `A` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, and `N`, `K` are assigned from input**
