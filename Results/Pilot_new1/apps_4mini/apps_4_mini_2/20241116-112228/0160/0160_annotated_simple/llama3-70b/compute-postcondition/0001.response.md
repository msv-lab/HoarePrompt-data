The variable `A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means that `A` will contain `N` integers that are inputted as a space-separated string. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new state of `A` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input**
