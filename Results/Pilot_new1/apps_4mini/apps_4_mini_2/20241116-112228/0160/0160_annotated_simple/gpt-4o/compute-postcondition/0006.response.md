According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 2. 

We also need to ensure that `x` is such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again. Since `x` is at least 1, we need to check the condition for `x`:

- If `x` is 1, `int(math.sqrt(1))` is 1, and the loop will not execute again since `i` will become 2.
- If `x` is 4 or greater, `int(math.sqrt(x))` will be at least 2, allowing the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the states must be adjusted to ensure that `x` is at least 4, and `i` is now set to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains `1` and `x // 1`, `x` is at least 4, and `i` is 2**
