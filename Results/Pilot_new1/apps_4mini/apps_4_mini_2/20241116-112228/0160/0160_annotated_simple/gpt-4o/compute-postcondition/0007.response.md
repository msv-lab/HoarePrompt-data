The value of `i` is added to the `divisors` set. Since `i` is 2, it will be added to the existing set of `divisors`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes 2, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes 2, and `i` is 2**
