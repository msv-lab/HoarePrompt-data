Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is a set that contains 1 and at least 2. If `x` is at least 4 and `i` is 2, then `divisors` will include 2 and may also include `x // 2` if `x` is even. If `x` is odd or less than 4, the contents of `divisors` remain unchanged apart from the guaranteed inclusion of 1.***
