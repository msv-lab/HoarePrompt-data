Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all unique divisors of `x` found within the range from 1 to `sqrt(x)`. If `x` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains empty. If `x` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not start and `divisors` will remain an empty set. If `x` is at least 2, `divisors` will contain at least 1 and may include additional divisors depending on the values of `i` and `x`.**
