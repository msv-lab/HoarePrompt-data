The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `A`, which is `A[0]`. The values of `N`, `K`, and the rest of the list `A` remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `gcd` based on the first element of `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, and `gcd` is `A[0]**
