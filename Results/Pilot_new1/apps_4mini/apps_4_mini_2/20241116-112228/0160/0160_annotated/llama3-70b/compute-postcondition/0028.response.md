Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers from input. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged and retains the maximum of its previous value and 3. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
