Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are added to the set of `divisors`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set of `divisors` remains unchanged. Moreover, `divisors` contains 1 and any integer `x` if it is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i + 1`, with `int(math.sqrt(x))` being at least `i + 1`.***
