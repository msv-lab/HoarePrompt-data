Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, `max_divisor` is at least 1, and `i` is 1. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
