The value of `gcd` is updated with the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the element of list `A` at index `i`. The previous value of `gcd` is the first element of list `A`, and `i` is 1, which means we are taking the gcd with the second element of `A`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(previous_gcd, A[1]), `i` is 1**
