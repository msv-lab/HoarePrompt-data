The function reads two integers, N and K, and a list of N integers A. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A and then finds the largest divisor of the gcd that is less than or equal to its square root. Finally, it prints this largest divisor. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. There are no checks for invalid input, so if the input does not meet the specified constraints, it may lead to unexpected behavior.
