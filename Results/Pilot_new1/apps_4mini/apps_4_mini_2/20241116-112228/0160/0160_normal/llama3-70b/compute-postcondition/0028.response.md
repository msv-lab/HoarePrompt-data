Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a non-empty list of integers, and `i` is at least 2. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. In all cases, the conditions regarding the values and relationships of the variables are satisfied.***
