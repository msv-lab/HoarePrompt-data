Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. The value of `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).***
