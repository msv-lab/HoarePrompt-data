The function accepts a list of integers `lst` with at least 2 elements and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list. It assumes that the list contains valid integers, and if the list has fewer than 2 elements, it does not handle this case and would not execute the loop, potentially leading to incorrect behavior. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the input list has at least 2 elements to avoid unexpected results.
