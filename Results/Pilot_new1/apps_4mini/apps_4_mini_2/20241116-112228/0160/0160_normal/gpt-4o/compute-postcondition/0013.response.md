Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` is a set containing `1`, `2`, and `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by `2`; if `x` is at least 4 and `i` is `k + 1` with `int(math.sqrt(x))` being at least `k + 1`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i` when `x % i == 0`. Otherwise, `divisors` remains unchanged.***
