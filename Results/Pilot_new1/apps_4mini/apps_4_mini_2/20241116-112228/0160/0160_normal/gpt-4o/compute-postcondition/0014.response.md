According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` with each iteration until it exceeds `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, meaning it has reached the next value after the last valid `i` in the previous iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `k + 1`, and `int(math.sqrt(x))` must be at least `k + 1`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now `k + 1` and `int(math.sqrt(x))` must be adjusted to be at least `k + 1`.

Thus, we need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `k + 1` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive); `divisors` is a set containing `1`, `2`, and `x // 2` if `x` is divisible by `2`; `x` is such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `k + 1`; `i` is `k + 1`**.
