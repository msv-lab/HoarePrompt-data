Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer. It calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then increments `n` until it becomes divisible by `x`, ensuring that the final output is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the original `n` that is divisible by `x`. The function does not return a value but prints the resulting integer. **
