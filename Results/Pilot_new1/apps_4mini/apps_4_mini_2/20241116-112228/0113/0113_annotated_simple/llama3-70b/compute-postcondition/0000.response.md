The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input, which consists of two integers. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range 0 to 8, the output state will reflect that `n` and `k` are now determined by the input values. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
