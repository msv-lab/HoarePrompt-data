The function `func` does not accept any parameters as it is defined with empty parentheses. Therefore, it does not take any input values directly. Based on the provided constraints, we can infer that the function is intended to work with a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 8), but these are not passed as parameters.

Since there is no output specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional details about its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is unspecified.**
