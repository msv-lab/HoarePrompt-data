The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer, and `k`, which is a non-negative integer. It calculates a `multiplier` as \(10^k\) and then computes a value `x` by multiplying `n` with the result of integer division of `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. The function finally returns this calculated value `x`.

The annotations imply that the function is designed to return a value based on the inputs, but they do not specify any potential edge cases, such as what happens if `n` is zero, which is not handled by the code since `n` is expected to be a positive integer. However, if `n` were zero, the GCD calculation would still be valid, but the result would be zero, which may not align with the intended use of the function.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as \(10^k\), and returns the value of \(n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right) \).**
