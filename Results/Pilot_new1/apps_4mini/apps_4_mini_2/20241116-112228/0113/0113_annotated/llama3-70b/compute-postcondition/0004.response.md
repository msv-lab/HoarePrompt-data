The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` was initially a positive integer based on input, after the execution, `n` will now be `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now `n + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, and `n + 1` is still not divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, and `n + 1` is not divisible by `x`**
