The variable `x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, which means `x` is calculated as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, so `x` will be a positive integer that is a power of 10. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer based on input, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
