The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which means that `n` will take a positive integer value and `k` will take a non-negative integer value based on user input. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but they will now be assigned new values based on the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that both variables have been updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer based on input, `k` is a non-negative integer based on input**
