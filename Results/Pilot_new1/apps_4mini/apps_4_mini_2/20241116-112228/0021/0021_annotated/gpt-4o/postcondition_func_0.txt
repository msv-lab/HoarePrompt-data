The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each integer in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list to both ends (index 0 and index n-1) and prints this maximum distance. The function assumes that both `1` and `n` are present in the list; if either is missing, it will raise a `ValueError`.
