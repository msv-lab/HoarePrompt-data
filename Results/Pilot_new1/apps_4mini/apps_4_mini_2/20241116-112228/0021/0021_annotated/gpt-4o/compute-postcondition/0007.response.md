The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are known from the initial state, where `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos); `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos); `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**
