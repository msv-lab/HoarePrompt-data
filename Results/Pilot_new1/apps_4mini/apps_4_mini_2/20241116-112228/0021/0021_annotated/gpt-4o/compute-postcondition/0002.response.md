The code assigns `min_pos` the value of the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `1` is expected to be one of those integers (given that `n` is at least `2`), the index of `1` will be a valid integer between `0` and `n-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input, and `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input, and `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`**
