The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of the value `n` in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. The value of `n` is used to find its index in the list `a`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be one of the distinct integers in `a`, `posn` will be assigned a valid index.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables after execution:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list a; `posn` is the index of the value n in the list a.**
