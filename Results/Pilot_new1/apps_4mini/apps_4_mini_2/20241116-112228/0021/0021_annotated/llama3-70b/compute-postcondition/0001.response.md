The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes an input of space-separated integers, converts each of them to an integer, and stores them in a list. The previous state indicates that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, and `a` will now contain `n` distinct integers within the range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` remains the same and `a` is now populated with the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input**
