The code assigns the index of the value `1` in the list `a` to the variable `pos1`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. Since the list `a` is not specified, we can only state that `pos1` will be the index of the integer `1` in that list. The output state will reflect this information.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list a.**
