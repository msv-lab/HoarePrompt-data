To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables based on the initial state.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input.
   - `pos1` is the index of the value `1` in the list `a`.
   - `posn` is the index of the value `n` in the list `a`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `max_dist` is assigned the value of `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
   - The expression `abs(pos1 - posn)` calculates the absolute difference between the indices of `1` and `n` in the list `a`.
   - Then, we subtract `1` from this absolute difference.
   - The second part of the `max` function is `n - 2`, which calculates the distance from the last index of the list (which is `n-1`) to the second last index (which is `n-2`).
   - The maximum of these two values will be stored in `max_dist`.

Since we do not have the exact values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`, we cannot compute a specific numerical result for `max_dist`. However, we can describe the output state in terms of the variables involved.

**Output State**: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of the value 1 in the list a; `posn` is the index of the value n in the list a; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
