Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, adjusted for the size of the list. The function prints the larger value between this maximum distance and the distance from the end of the list to the closest number. However, the function does not handle cases where the integers 1 or `n` are not present in the list, which would raise a `ValueError`. **
