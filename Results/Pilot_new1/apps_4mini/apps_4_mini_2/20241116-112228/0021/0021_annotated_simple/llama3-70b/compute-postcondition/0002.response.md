The code assigns `pos1` the value of the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers based on user input, and since `n` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), we know `a` has at least 2 elements. The presence of `1` in the list is assumed based on the context of the operation. Therefore, `pos1` will hold the index of `1` in the list `a`.

Since the specific values of `a` are not provided, we can only indicate that `pos1` will be the index of `1` in the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.**
