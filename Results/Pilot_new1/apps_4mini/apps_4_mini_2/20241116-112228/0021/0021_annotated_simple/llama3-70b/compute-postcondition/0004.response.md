To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in the context of the initial state.

1. `max_dist` is assigned the value of the maximum between two expressions: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
2. The variable `pos1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Therefore, we cannot compute `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.
3. The variable `n` is known to be an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), so `n - 2` will yield a value between 0 and 98.
4. Since `pos1` is unknown, we cannot fully evaluate `max_dist`.

Given the above points, the output state reflects the known values of `n` and the undefined nature of `pos1`:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is either undefined or dependent on the unknown value of `pos1`.**
