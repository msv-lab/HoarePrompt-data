To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the logic implemented in the `func()` function based on the problem description.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The first line reads an integer `n`, which indicates the size of the permutation.
   - The second line reads the permutation itself, which is a list of integers.

2. **Finding Positions**:
   - The program finds the position of the minimum element (1) using `a.index(1)` and the position of the maximum element (n) using `a.index(n)`.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum distance possible after one swap using:
     ```python
     max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     ```
   - Then it prints the result as:
     ```python
     print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
     ```

### Logical Flaws:
- The code attempts to calculate the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap, but the logic used for calculating `max_dist` and `min_dist` is flawed.
- Specifically, `max_dist` does not correctly represent the maximum distance achievable after one swap. The correct approach should consider the potential positions of the minimum and maximum elements after one swap, specifically checking the corners of the array (indices 0 and n-1) since swapping the minimum or maximum with an element at the end or beginning would yield the maximum distance.

### Example Cases:
1. **Example Input**: 
   ```
   5
   4 5 1 3 2
   ```
   - Expected Output: 3 (by swapping 1 and 2).
   - The program might return 2 because it calculates based on the current positions without considering swaps correctly.

2. **Example Input**:
   ```
   6
   6 5 4 3 2 1
   ```
   - Expected Output: 5 (already maximum distance).
   - The program might incorrectly calculate based on its logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not accurately compute the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap due to incorrect logic in calculating distances. 

Correctness: **False**
