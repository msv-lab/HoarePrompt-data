The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is specified to be an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, the new value of `n` will be an integer within this range. The variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n, and `n` is an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n, and `n` is an input integer within the specified range**
