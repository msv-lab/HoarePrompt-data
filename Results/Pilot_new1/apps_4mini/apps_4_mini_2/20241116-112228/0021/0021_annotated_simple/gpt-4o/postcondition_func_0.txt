The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers, calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` to the ends of the list, and prints this maximum distance. It does not handle cases where 1 or `n` are not present in the list or where the list does not contain exactly `n` elements.
