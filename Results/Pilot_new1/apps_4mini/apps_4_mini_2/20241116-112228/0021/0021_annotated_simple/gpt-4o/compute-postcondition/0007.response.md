The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The calculation of `dist4` depends on the values of `n` and `min_pos`, which are provided in the initial state. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables and the new value of `dist4`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, `n` is an input integer within the specified range, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos), `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos), and `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**
