The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate values. The input will provide a sequence of integers that will be converted to a list of integers. The previous state of `a` is not specified, but it will now contain the integers from the input. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `n` remains as an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from the input, and `n` is an input integer within the specified range**
