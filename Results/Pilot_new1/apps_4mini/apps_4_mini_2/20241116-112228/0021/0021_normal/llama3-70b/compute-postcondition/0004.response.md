To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its effect on the initial state.

1. The code calculates `max_dist` using the formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
2. The variables affected by this calculation are `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.
3. The value of `max_dist` will depend on the specific values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.

Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, and `posn` is the index of n in list `a`, we can summarize the output state as follows:

- `pos1` and `posn` are known indices based on the permutation of integers from 1 to n.
- The value of `max_dist` is calculated based on the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, adjusted by subtracting 1, and comparing it with `n - 2`.

Thus, the output state can be expressed in a general form, as we do not have specific values for `pos1` and `posn`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
