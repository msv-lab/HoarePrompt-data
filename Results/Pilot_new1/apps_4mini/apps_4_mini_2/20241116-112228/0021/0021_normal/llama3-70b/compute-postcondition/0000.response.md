The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, but its specific value is not known until input is provided. The list `a` is not affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n; `n` is assigned an input integer.**
