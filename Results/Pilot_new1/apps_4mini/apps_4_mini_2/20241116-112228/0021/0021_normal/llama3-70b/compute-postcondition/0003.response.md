The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of `n` in the list `a`. The variable `a` contains a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`, so `n` must be present in `a`. The previous state of the variables is unaffected except for `posn`, which will now hold the index of `n` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`.**
