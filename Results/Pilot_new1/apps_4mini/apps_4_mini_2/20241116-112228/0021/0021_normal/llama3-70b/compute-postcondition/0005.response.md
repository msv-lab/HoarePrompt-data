To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its effect on the initial state.

1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
2. The values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are already defined in the initial state.
3. We calculate `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and compare it with `n - 2` to find the minimum value.

Since the exact values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not provided, we can summarize the output state based on the calculations described.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
