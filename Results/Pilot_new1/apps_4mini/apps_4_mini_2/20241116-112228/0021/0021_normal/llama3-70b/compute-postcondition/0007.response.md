The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` which is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers that is a permutation of the integers from 1 to n.**
