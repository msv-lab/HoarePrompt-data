The code assigns `max_distance` the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The values of `dist1` and `dist2` are defined based on the initial state, but `dist3` and `dist4` cannot be computed because `min_pos` is undefined. Therefore, `dist3` and `dist4` will also be considered undefined.

Since `dist3` and `dist4` are undefined, the `max` function will not be able to operate correctly with these values. Thus, the output state reflects that `max_distance` cannot be determined due to the presence of undefined variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in a; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is undefined; `dist4` is undefined; `max_distance` cannot be determined due to undefined variables.**
