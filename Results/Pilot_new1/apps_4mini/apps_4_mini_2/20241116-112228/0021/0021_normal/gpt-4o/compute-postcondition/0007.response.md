The code assigns a value to `dist4` using the expression `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. However, `min_pos` is undefined in the initial state, which means that we cannot compute a value for `dist4`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values and the issue with `min_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in a; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos) where min_pos is undefined; `dist4` is undefined due to min_pos being undefined.**
