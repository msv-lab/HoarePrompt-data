The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will be populated with integers obtained from user input as a space-separated string. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`. Therefore, after execution, the state of `a` will change based on the input provided, but `n` remains unchanged. 

Since `n` is defined as an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, and `a` will contain `n` distinct integers, the output state reflects the potential input that will populate `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers populated from user input**
