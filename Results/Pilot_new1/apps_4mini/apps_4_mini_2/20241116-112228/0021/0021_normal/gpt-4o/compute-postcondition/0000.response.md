The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `a` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation of size n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation of size n**
