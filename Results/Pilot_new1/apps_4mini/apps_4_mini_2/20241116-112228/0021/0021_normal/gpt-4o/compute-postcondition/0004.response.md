The variable `dist1` is assigned the value of `abs(0 - max_pos)`. The value of `max_pos` is known as the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, which is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute value of `-max_pos`, which is simply `max_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`.**
