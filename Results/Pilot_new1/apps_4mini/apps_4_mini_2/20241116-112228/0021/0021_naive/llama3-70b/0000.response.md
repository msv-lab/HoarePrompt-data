To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. The input consists of an integer `n` (size of the permutation) and a list `a` of distinct integers from 1 to n.
2. The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.
3. The output should be the maximum possible distance after the swap.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code does the following:
1. It reads the integer `n` and the list `a`.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates the current distance between these two elements.
4. It computes the maximum distance achievable after one swap.

### Potential Issues:
- The code uses `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` and `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which seems to be an attempt to calculate the maximum possible distance after a swap. However, the logic appears flawed:
  - The current distance is calculated, but the adjustment does not correctly account for the positions of 1 and n relative to the ends of the array.
  - Specifically, it does not consider that if 1 is at the start (index 0) and n is at the end (index n-1), the distance is already maximized, and any swap will yield a distance less than n-1.
  
### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
2
1 2
```
- Here, the minimum and maximum are already at the ends (1 at index 0 and 2 at index 1), so the distance is 1.
- The program should output 1 since swapping them will not increase the distance, but it incorrectly calculates it by applying the flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the minimum and maximum are already at their maximum distance. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
