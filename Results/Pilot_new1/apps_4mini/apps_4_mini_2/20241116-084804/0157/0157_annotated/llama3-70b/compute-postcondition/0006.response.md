Functionality: ** The function prompts the user to input three integers, calculates the minimum number of complete sets of ingredients needed to make a dish (where one set requires 1 lemon, 2 of another ingredient, and 4 of a third ingredient), and then prints the total number of ingredients used based on that minimum. Specifically, it calculates the total as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`. The function does not handle any potential input errors or cases where the inputs are negative. **
