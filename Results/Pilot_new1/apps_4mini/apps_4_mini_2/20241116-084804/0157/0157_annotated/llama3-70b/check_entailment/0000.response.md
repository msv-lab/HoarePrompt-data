To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code and how it relates to the problem description, as well as the provided annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Nikolay has `a` lemons, `b` apples, and `c` pears.
- The fruits must be used in the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears.
- We need to find the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, or return 0 if it's not possible to use any fruits.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func()` reads three integers from input, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of the required ratio using the formula:

```python
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```

This line determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be created based on the available quantities. The minimum of:
- `a` (the number of lemons),
- `b // 2` (the number of pairs of apples available, since 2 apples are needed per lemon),
- `c // 4` (the number of sets of pears available, since 4 pears are needed per lemon).

Then, the total number of fruits used is calculated as:

```python
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

This simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`, which correctly represents the total count of fruits used for the complete sets.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations summarize the function's purpose and describe how it calculates the total number of fruits based on the minimum number of complete sets. They also mention that the function does not handle potential input errors or negative cases, but since the problem guarantees positive integers within a specific range (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), this is not a concern here.

### Example Cases:
1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `2, 5, 7`
   - Calculation: `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4, 7, 13`
   - Calculation: `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Output: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2, 3, 2`
   - Calculation: `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
The program does not explicitly handle cases where any of the inputs are less than the required counts for any fruit type, but since the inputs are guaranteed to be positive integers and the logic correctly calculates the minimum sets, the function will always return correct results for valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases given the constraints. There are no edge cases that it fails to handle based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
