To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the variables and the expression provided in the code snippet.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `c` is a new input integer
   - `min_lemon` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The code calculates `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. 
   - This expression can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.

3. **Impact on Variables**: 
   - The value of `min_lemon` is determined by the minimum of the three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 
   - The final output will depend on the value of `min_lemon`, but since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we cannot specify exact numerical values.

4. **Output State**: 
   - The output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and the computed value of `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), and the output is min_lemon * 7**.
