The variable `c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this assignment, but `c` will now hold a new integer value based on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `c` is now a new input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer**
