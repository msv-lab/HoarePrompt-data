The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made from the given fruits based on the constraints that each lemon requires one lemon, two apples, and four pears. The function then computes the total number of fruits based on the maximum number of lemons and prints this total. However, it does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, there are no checks for negative or non-integer inputs, which could lead to errors.
