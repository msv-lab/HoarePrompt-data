To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has three types of fruits: lemons, apples, and pears. The required ratio for making the compote is:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

Given the counts of each fruit, the task is to compute the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, adhering to the specified ratios.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())  # Number of lemons
    b = int(input())  # Number of apples
    c = int(input())  # Number of pears
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)  # Determine the maximum number of lemons that can be used
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4  # Calculate total fruits used
    print(total_fruits)  # Output the total fruits
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` ensures that the number of lemons does not exceed the available lemons, and that there are enough apples and pears to maintain the required ratio.
3. The total number of fruits used is calculated as:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

### Test Cases:
Let's consider a few test cases to verify if the program works correctly.

1. **Input:**
   ```
   2
   5
   7
   ```
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Total fruits: `1 * 7 = 7`
   - Output: `7` (Correct)

2. **Input:**
   ```
   4
   7
   13
   ```
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Total fruits: `3 * 7 = 21`
   - Output: `21` (Correct)

3. **Input:**
   ```
   2
   3
   2
   ```
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Total fruits: `0 * 7 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Edge Case:**
   ```
   1
   1
   1
   ```
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = min(1, 0, 0) = 0`
   - Total fruits: `0 * 7 = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

5. **Edge Case with maximum values:**
   ```
   1000
   2000
   4000
   ```
   - Calculation: `max_lemons = min(1000, 2000 // 2, 4000 // 4) = min(1000, 1000, 1000) = 1000`
   - Total fruits: `1000 * 7 = 7000`
   - Output: `7000` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote according to the given ratios and handles various edge cases effectively. 

Correctness: **True**
