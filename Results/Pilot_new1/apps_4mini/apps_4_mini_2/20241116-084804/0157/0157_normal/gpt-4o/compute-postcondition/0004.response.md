To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet provided.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

Now, the code snippet calculates `total_fruits`:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

1. The value of `max_lemons` is determined from the initial state. 
2. The calculation for `total_fruits` uses `max_lemons`:
   - It first multiplies `max_lemons` by 1, then by 2, and finally by 4.
   - This results in `total_fruits = max_lemons + 2 * max_lemons + 4 * max_lemons = 7 * max_lemons`.

The output state will reflect the values of the variables after executing the code snippet, including the calculated `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons**
