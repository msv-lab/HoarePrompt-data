The function accepts three integer inputs representing the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made using the available fruits, where each lemon requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The function then calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons and prints this total. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, the function does not handle potential input errors or negative values.
