The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any specific output based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers representing quantities of lemons, apples, and pears, but there is no specified return value or behavior based on these inputs.
