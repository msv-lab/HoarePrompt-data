According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. The loop will execute again if `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is 0, and `num` would be equal to `r` after the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be adjusted to `r + 1`. 

Since `total_sum` was updated only if `func_1(num, k)` returned true, and it remains 0 otherwise, there are no changes needed for `total_sum` itself. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num`.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is `r + 1`**
