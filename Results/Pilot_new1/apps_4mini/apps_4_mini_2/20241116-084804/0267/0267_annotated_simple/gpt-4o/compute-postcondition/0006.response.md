The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is `r + 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + (r + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(r + 1) % MOD`. The value of `num` does not affect the state of other variables. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_sum` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`total_sum` is (r + 1) % MOD, `num` is r + 1**
