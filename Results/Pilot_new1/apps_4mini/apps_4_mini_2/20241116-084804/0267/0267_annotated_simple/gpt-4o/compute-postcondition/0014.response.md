The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which another function `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo a constant `MOD`. If no integers satisfy this condition, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers in that range that meet a specific condition, or 0 if no integers meet the condition. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l and r defining a range of integers, and k, and returns the sum of integers from l to r that satisfy a condition defined by another function, modulo MOD, or 0 if no integers satisfy the condition.**
