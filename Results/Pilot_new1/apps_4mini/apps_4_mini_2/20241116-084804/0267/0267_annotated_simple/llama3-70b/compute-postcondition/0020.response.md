Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; if `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10 and `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is initially set to 9 and subsequently modified by a series of calculations involving powers of 10 and the value of `n`, with the final result being taken modulo `MOD`. The exact value of `dp[n, k]` in this case cannot be determined without knowing `MOD`.***
