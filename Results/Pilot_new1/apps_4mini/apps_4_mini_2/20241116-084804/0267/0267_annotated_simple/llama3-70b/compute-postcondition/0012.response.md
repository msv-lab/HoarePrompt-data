According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts from 1 and goes up to `k - 1`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value of `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` would need to be equal to `k`, which is not less than `k`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

Since `i` is at `k - 1`, to allow for another iteration, we would need to adjust `k` to be greater than `k`. However, since `k` is a constant greater than 1, we cannot make a meaningful adjustment to `k` that allows the loop to run again without changing the fundamental constraints.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is to increase `k` by at least 1. 

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10**
