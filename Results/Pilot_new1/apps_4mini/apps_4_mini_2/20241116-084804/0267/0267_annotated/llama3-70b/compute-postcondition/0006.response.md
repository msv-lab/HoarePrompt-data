Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`. The state of the program remains unchanged if `k` is greater than 0 and the tuple (n, k) does not exist in the collection `dp`.***
