Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; if `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is between 1 and 10, and if `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is initially set to 9 and updated through a series of calculations that depend on the value of `k`, leading to a final value that is computed based on the loop iterations and modulo operations. The state of the program remains unchanged if the tuple (n, k) exists in the collection `dp` prior to these operations.***
