According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2, as the loop will iterate over the range from 1 to `k - 1`. 

Since `k` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 2, which is not less than `k`, thus the loop will not execute again. Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to `i`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is 90, `i` is 2**
