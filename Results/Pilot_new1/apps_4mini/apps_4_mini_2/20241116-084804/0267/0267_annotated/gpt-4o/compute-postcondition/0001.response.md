According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which is guaranteed by the provided conditions (1 <= l <= r < 10^18). 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take on the value of `l` during the first iteration. The `total_sum` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect the execution of the loop itself. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `num` starts at `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
