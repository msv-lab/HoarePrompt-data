The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Here, `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). The function calculates the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which another function, `func_1(num, k)`, returns true. If there are no such integers or if `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r`, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers from `l` to `r` that satisfy a condition defined by `func_1`, or return 0 if no integers meet the criteria or if the range is invalid. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, or 0 if no such integers exist or if `l` is greater than `r`.**
