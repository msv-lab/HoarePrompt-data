To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and print this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Functions and Output Hints:
1. **Function 1:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       return len(set(str(n))) <= k
   ```
   - **Output Description:** The function checks if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Function 2:**
   ```python
   def func_2(l, r, k):
       total_sum = 0
       for num in range(l, r + 1):
           if func_1(num, k):
               total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
       return total_sum
   ```
   - **Output Description:** The function calculates the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1** seems to work correctly as it accurately counts the unique digits in `n` and compares it with `k`. However, it does not handle negative values of `k`, which is not logically applicable to the problem but could be considered an edge case.
  
- **Function 2** iterates through each number from `l` to `r`, checks if it meets the digit condition using `func_1`, and accumulates the sum. This approach is straightforward but may not be efficient for large ranges, especially since `l` and `r` can be as large as `10^18`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Large Ranges:** If `l` and `r` are very large, the loop in `func_2` could take a considerable amount of time to execute since it checks every number in that range. This could lead to performance issues but does not affect correctness.
  
2. **Negative `k`:** While the problem description specifies `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`, if `k` were to be negative (which it cannot be according to the description), the program would not handle it correctly. However, this scenario is not valid based on the constraints.

3. **No Valid Numbers:** If there are no numbers in the range `[l, r]` that have at most `k` different digits, the function should return `0`. The output description mentions this, and the implementation appears to handle it correctly.

### Conclusion:
The code adheres to the problem description for all valid inputs, as it correctly sums the numbers that meet the digit criteria and handles the modulo operation. Despite the performance concerns for large ranges, the correctness of the output is maintained as per the specifications.

Therefore, after analyzing the code and considering the output hints, we conclude that:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly calculates the required sum for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
