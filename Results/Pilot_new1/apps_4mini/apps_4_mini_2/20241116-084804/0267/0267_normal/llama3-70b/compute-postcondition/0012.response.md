According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently less than `k - 1` (since the loop iterates from 1 to `k-1`). 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `i + 1`, and since `k` is greater than 1, it remains unchanged. 

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated to 9 + 9 * (10, `i` is 2**
