According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute again if there is at least one more list in `cubes` after the current iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 4 lists, and `cube` must be the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 4 lists; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
