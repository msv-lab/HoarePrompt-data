Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) that represent the digits on the faces of cubes. It collects all unique digits from these inputs into a set, removes '0' if it exists, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and concatenating them. The function then prints this maximum number. If no valid digits remain after removing '0', it will result in an empty string being printed. **
