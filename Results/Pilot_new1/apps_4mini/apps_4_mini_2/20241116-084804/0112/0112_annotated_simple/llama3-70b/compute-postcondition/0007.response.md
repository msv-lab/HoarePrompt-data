According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop iterates over each `cube` in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `cubes` has at least 2 lists. If `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it indicates that there can be up to 3 lists in `cubes`. Since we are currently on the second list, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more list in `cubes`. Therefore, `cubes` must contain at least 3 lists, and `cube` must be updated to reflect the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
