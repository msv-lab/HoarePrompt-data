The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any parameters. However, it operates based on the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and each of the next `n` lines contains 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. 

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot specify the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process input based on the constraints regarding `n` and the digits on the cube faces.

Functionality: **The function processes input based on the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and the subsequent lines containing 6 integers each (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the cube faces, but the specific output is not defined.**
