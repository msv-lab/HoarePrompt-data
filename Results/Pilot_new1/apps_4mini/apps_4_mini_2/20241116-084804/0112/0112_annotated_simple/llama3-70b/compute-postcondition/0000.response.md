The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, which means `n` can be 1, 2, or 3. Other variables are not affected at this point.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
