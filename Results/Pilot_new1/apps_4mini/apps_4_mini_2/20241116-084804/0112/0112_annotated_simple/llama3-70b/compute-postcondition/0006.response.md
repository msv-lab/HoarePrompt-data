The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each integer in the `cube` list. The variable `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and since `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, `cube` is guaranteed to have integer values. The `digits` set will now include the string representations of these integers.

Since the specific values of `cube` and `digits` are not provided, we can describe the transformation generically. The previous state of `digits` will be updated to include the string representations of the integers from `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
