The code prints the value of `max_num`. The value of `max_num` has already been determined by forming the largest possible integer from the sorted string representations in `digits`. The state of `digits` remains unchanged unless '0' was present and removed, but since it is not specified in the initial state, we assume it is not relevant for this output.

Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `max_num` without any changes to other variables.

Output State: **`max_num` is the integer formed by the largest possible number from the sorted string representations in `digits`, and it is printed.**
