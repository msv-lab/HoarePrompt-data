The code initializes `cubes` as a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the input values (converted to integers) for `n` times. The value of `n` can be either 1, 2, or 3, which determines how many lists will be created based on user input. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input**
