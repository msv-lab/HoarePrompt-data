According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 2, which means `n` must be 3. Additionally, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, as the loop iterates from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states should reflect that `n` is 3 and `i` is 3.

State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 3 lists containing 6 integers, and `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element where `digit` is the first element in `digits`.**
