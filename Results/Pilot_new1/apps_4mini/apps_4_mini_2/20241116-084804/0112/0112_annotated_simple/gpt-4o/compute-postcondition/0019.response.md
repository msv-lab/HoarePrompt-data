Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, and `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element where `digit` is the first element in `digits`. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[2]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[2]`, no changes are made to `used_cubes[2]` or `found`.***
