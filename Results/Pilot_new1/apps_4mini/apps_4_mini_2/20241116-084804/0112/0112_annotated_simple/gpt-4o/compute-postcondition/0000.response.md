The code takes the variable `num`, which is not explicitly defined in the initial state but is presumably an integer. The code converts `num` into a string, then creates a list of its digits by iterating over each character in the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `digits`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9, and `digits` is a list of digits from `num`**.
