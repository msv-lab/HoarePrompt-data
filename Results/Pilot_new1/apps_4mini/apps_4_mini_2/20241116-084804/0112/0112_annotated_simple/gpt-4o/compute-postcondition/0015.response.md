According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. This means that the loop can execute one more time if `n` is at least 2.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` to 2, as `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` remains at least 2, and we can set `i` to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, and `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element where `digit` is the first element in `digits`.**
