Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, and `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element where `digit` is the first element in `digits`. If `used_cubes[1]` was False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not satisfied, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its value of True.***
