The code initializes `used_cubes` as a list of boolean values, each set to `False`, with a length of `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the resulting `used_cubes` will contain `n` entries, all set to `False`. The states of the other variables (`cube_faces` and `digits`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers; `digits` is a list of digits from `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers; `digits` is a list of digits from `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values.**
