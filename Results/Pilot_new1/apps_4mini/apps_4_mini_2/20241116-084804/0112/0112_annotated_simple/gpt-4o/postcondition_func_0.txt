The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists, each containing 6 integers representing the faces of cubes. It checks how many numbers (from 1 to 3) can be formed using the cubes' faces by calling the function `can_form_number`. It returns 0 if none of the numbers 1, 2, or 3 can be formed; otherwise, it returns the highest number (1, 2, or 3) that can be formed. If `can_form_number` is never called, `x` remains 0, and thus the function will return 0.
