The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which is its current value. The other variables, `used_cubes` and `digits`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `found` is False, and `digits` contains at least one more digit.

Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `found` is False, and `digits` contains at least one more digit**
