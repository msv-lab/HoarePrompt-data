According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, as `n` is always greater than or equal to 1. 

Before the loop starts, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to 0, as it will start from this value in the first iteration of the loop. The other variables (`cube_faces`, `used_cubes`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`) do not directly affect whether the loop executes, but they must be in a valid state for the loop body to function properly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 0, and `n` should remain as defined (1 ≤ n ≤ 3).

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is False**
