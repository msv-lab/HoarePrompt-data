Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where `used_cubes[i]` is `True` if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]` for the first `i` where `0 â‰¤ i < n`, and `found` is set to True if any cube face containing the digit was found. If `digit` is not found in any `cube_faces` or if all `used_cubes` are already `True`, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. If `n` is 0 or less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains a list of `False` values, and `found` remains False.**
