You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and cube_faces is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9.
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where each value indicates whether the corresponding cube face has been used; `found` is a boolean that indicates if the current digit was matched with a cube face. If all digits in `digits` are found in `cube_faces`, `used_cubes` will have some `True` values, and `found` will be `True` for each digit processed. If any digit cannot be matched, `found` will be `False` for that digit, and the function returns `False`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, resulting in `used_cubes` remaining a list of `False` values and `found` remaining `False`. If `n` is 0, the loop also does not execute, and the output state reflects that `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` is `False`.

Case_2: The program returns True

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
