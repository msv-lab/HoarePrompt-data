Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values and `found` is a boolean. If `found` is False, the function returns False, indicating that no cube face containing the digit was found, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `n` is 0 or less than 1, the loop does not execute, resulting in `used_cubes` remaining a list of `False` values and `found` remaining False.***
