According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` contains at least one more digit, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` contains at least one more digit, and `found` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, `digits` must have at least one more digit than before, and `digit` should be the next digit in the `digits` list.

State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `found` is False, and `digits` contains at least one more digit, `digit` is the next digit in the list**
