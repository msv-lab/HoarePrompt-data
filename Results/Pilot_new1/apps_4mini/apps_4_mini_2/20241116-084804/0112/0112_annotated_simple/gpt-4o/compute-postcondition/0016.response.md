The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` is 2, which means `used_cubes[2]` is set to `True`. The initial state does not provide information about the previous values of `used_cubes`, but we know that `i` is within the valid range for the index of `used_cubes` based on the initial state. Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element where `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `used_cubes[2]` is set to True.**
