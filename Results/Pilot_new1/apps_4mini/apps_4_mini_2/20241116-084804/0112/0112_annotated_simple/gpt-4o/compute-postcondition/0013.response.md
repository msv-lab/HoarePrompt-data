The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values where `used_cubes[1]` is now True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
