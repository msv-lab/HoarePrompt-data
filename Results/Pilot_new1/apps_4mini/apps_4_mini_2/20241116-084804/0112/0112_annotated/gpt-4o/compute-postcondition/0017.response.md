The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the third digit in the `digits` list (if available), and `used_cubes[2]` is `True`, and `found` is set to `True`.
