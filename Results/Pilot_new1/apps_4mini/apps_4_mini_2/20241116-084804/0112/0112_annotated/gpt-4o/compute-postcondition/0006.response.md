The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`. The previous value of `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, and this change indicates that the cube at index `i` is now marked as used. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list, `found` is False, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list, `found` is False, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`**.
