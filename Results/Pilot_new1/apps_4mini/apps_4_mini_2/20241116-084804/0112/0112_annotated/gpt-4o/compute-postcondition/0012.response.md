The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state of `found` is not specified, but it is now set to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `digit`, and `used_cubes[i]`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, and `used_cubes[i]` is set to True.
