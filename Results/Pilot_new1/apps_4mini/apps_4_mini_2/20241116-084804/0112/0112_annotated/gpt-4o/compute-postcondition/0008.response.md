The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
