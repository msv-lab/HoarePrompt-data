The function `can_form_number` accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces` containing lists of integers representing the faces of cubes. The function checks if each digit of `num` can be matched to the available cube faces without reusing any cube. If a digit cannot be matched to any of the cube faces, the function returns `False`. If all digits can be matched, it returns `True`. 

However, if `n` (the number of cubes) is 0, the loop does not execute, and the function would implicitly return `True` since there are no digits to match, which is not explicitly stated in the annotations. Additionally, if `num` is 0, the digits list will contain a single element '0', which can be matched if any cube has a face with 0. 

The function does not handle the scenario where `cube_faces` might be empty or where `num` has digits that cannot be matched to any cube face, returning `False` in such cases.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, and returns `True` if all digits of `num` can be matched to the faces of the cubes without reusing any cube; otherwise, it returns `False`. If there are no cubes (n = 0), it returns `True` if `num` has no digits or `False` if it has digits that cannot be matched. **
