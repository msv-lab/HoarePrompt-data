The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` is 2, so `used_cubes[2]` is now `True`. The states of the other variables, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, and `digit`, are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the third digit in the `digits` list (if available), and `used_cubes[2]` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each between 0 and 9, `digits` is a list with at least one digit, `digit` is the third digit in the `digits` list (if available), and `used_cubes[2]` is `True`**
