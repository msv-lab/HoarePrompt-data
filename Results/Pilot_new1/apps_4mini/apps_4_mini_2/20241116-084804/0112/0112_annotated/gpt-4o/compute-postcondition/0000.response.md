The code converts `num` to a string and then creates a list of its digits. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `num`. Therefore, the output state reflects the uncertainty of the value of `num` and the resulting list of digits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; `digits` is a list of the digits of `num` as a string.**
