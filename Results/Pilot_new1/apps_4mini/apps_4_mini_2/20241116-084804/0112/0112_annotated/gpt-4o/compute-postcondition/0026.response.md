The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which is its current value, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`digits`, `n`, and `used_cubes`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is False, `digits` has at least one more digit, `n` is at least 1, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more digit, `n` is at least 1, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged**
