The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained by 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Additionally, the function processes a cube represented as a list of 6 integers, where each integer `a_{i}_{j}` satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. The function does not explicitly return any value based on the provided information. However, it implies that the function performs operations related to the cubes defined by the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of 6 integers representing a cube, where each integer is between 0 and 9. The function processes this input but does not return a value based on the provided information.**
