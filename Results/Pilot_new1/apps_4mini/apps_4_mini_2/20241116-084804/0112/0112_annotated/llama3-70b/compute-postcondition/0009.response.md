According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` has more than 3 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3, which means `cubes` currently has exactly 3 lists. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` would need to be the fourth list in `cubes`. 

Since `n` is currently 3, it needs to be adjusted to indicate that `cubes` has at least 4 lists. Additionally, `cube` should be updated to reference the fourth list.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `cubes` is a list of at least 4 lists of integers, `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with the string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
