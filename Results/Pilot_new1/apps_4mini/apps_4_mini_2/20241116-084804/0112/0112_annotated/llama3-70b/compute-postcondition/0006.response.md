The code updates `digits` with the string representations of the integers from the list `cube`. The value of `n` can be either 2 or 3, which means `cubes` contains either 2 or 3 lists. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, it will exist as long as `n` is at least 2. The specific integers in `cube` are not provided, but they will be converted to strings and added to `digits`.

The output state will reflect the update to `digits` based on the contents of `cube`. Since `cube` contains integers, `digits` will now include their string representations.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with the string representations of the integers in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with the string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
