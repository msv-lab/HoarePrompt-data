The code updates the `digits` set with the string representation of each digit in the `cube` list. The `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube` will contain some integers. The previous values of `digits` are not specified, but it will now include the string representations of the integers in `cube`. 

Assuming `cube` contains valid integers, the output state reflects the updated contents of `digits`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 list; `cube` is the first list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
