The `digits` variable is updated to include the string representations of each digit in the `cube` list. The current state of `cube` is not provided, but it is assumed to contain integer values. The `str(digit)` converts each digit in `cube` to its string representation and adds it to `digits`. The previous values of `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated `digits`, which now includes the string representations of the digits from `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated to include the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
