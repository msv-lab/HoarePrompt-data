According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 3 lists, and `cube` needs to be updated to the third list in `cubes`. Since `n` can be at most 3, it should be adjusted to reflect that there are now 3 lists in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to include the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
