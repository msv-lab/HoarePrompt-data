The `digits` variable is updated to include the string representations of each digit in `cube`. The value of `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and since `n` can be an integer from 1 to 3, `cube` will contain a specific set of integers depending on the structure of `cubes`. The previous state of `digits` is not specified, but it will now include the string representations of the integers in `cube`.

Since `cube` is defined as the second list in `cubes`, and `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, `digits` will be updated accordingly. The specific values of `cube` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact contents of `digits` after the update.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
