According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least 1 list (i.e., it should not be empty). Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it suggests that `cubes` could potentially have 1 to 3 elements corresponding to the value of `n`. 

Since `digits` is an empty set, it does not affect the loop's execution. However, we need to ensure that `cube` is defined for the first iteration of the loop.

To summarize, for the loop to be executed, `cubes` must contain at least 1 element, and `cube` should be the first element of the `cubes` list during the first iteration. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
