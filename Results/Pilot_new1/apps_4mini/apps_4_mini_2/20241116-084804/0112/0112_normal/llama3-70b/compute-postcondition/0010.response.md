Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all digits found in the lists contained in `cubes`. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, the loop will execute at least once, updating `digits` accordingly. `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 0 to 3 lists.**
