According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. However, we need to determine the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration to see if the loop can execute one more time.

Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` with each iteration, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we can infer that `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

If `i` was equal to `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `i` is now `n`, and the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be `n - 1` or less.

Assuming `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the last iteration, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be set to `n - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `used_cubes[1]`, `found`, and `digit` do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged unless it was previously False, in which case it is set to True, `found` is set to True, `i` is `n - 1`**
