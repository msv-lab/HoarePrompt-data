According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False and `digits` has at least one more element. For the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least one more element than it did at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `digits` has at least two elements remaining, and the `digit` should represent the next element in the list.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least two elements, `digit` is the next element in the list**
