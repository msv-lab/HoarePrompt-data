Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `used_cubes[1]` remains unchanged unless it was previously False, in which case it is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[1]`. If `used_cubes[1]` was already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes` and `found` remain unchanged.***
