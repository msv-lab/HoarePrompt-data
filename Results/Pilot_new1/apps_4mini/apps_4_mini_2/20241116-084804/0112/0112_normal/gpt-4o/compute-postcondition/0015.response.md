According to the code, the loop will execute again if the variable `i` is less than `n`. The provided state indicates that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. Since `i` is not specified, we can infer that it must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again.

To determine the new state, we need to consider the possible values for `i`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now 1 (if `n` is 2) or 2 (if `n` is 3). Additionally, `n` must be adjusted to ensure that it allows for another iteration, meaning it should be at least 2.

Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, we can conclude that `n` must be adjusted to be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` retains its previous value, and `i` is 1** (if `n` is 2) or **`i` is 2** (if `n` is 3).
