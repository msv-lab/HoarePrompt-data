The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, where `i` is 1. This means that the element at index 1 of the `used_cubes` list is updated to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `found`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `used_cubes` at index 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `found` retains its previous value, and `i` is 1**
