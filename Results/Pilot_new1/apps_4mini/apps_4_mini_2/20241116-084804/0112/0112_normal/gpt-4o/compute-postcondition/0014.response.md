Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most inner loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` retains its previous value.***
