Postcondition: ***`res` is a string containing each character from `s` repeated for each occurrence, transformed into the next character in the alphabet until all characters in `s` are processed. The length of `res` is exactly 26. `s` may contain characters from `alphabet` and possibly characters not in `alphabet`, but all characters processed have contributed to the length of `res`.***
