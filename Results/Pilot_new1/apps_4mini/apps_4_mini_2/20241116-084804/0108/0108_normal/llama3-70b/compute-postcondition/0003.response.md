According to the code, the loop iterates over the `alphabet`, which is a predefined string containing all lowercase English letters. The loop will execute once for each character in the `alphabet`, regardless of the state of `s` or `res`. 

Since `char` will take on each letter of `alphabet` starting from 'a' to 'z', we need to set `char` to the first character of `alphabet` at the beginning of the loop. The variables `s` and `res` do not affect the execution of the loop in this context.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `char` is 'a', which is the first character of `alphabet`.

State: **`s` is a new input string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is '', `char` is 'a'**
