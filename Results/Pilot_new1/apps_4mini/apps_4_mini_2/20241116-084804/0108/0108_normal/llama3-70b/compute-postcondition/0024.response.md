Output State: **`if 'a' is present in s then res is a repeated string of 'a' for each occurrence of 'a' in s plus one 'c' for each occurrence of 'c' in s, s has all occurrences of 'c' replaced with 'd', and char is the last character processed before the loop ends. If 'a' is not present in s, the loop does not execute, res remains a repeated string of 'a' for each occurrence in s, s remains unchanged, and char is 'c'.`**
