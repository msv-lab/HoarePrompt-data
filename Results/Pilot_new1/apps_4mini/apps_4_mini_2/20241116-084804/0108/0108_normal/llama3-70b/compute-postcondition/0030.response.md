The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` (which is 'd') in the string `s` with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. The ASCII value of 'd' is 100, and the next character is 'e' (ASCII value 101). 

Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of 'd', it will be replaced with 'e'. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a repeated string of 'a' for each occurrence of 'a' in `s` plus one 'c' for each occurrence of 'c' in `s` plus one 'd'; `s` now has the first 'd' replaced with 'e'; `char` is 'd'.

Output State: **`res` is a repeated string of 'a' for each occurrence of 'a' in `s` plus one 'c' for each occurrence of 'c' in `s` plus one 'd'; `s` now has the first 'd' replaced with 'e'; `char` is 'd'**.
