Output State: **`if s contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then j is 26 and i is the length of s; if s is shorter than 26 characters or doesn't contain all characters from 'a' to 'z', then j is less than 26 and i is the length of s; if s is empty, the loop doesn't execute and both i and j remain 0.**
