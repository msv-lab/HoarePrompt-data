Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If `s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then `j` is 26 and `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `target` is printed. If `s` is shorter than 26 characters or does not contain all characters from 'a' to 'z', then `j` is less than 26, `i` is the length of `s`, and -1 is printed. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `i` and `j` remain 0, resulting in -1 being printed.***
