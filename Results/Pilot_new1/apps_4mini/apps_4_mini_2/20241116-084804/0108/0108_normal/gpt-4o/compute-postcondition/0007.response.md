The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j`) are not affected. Thus, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
