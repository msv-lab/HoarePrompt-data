Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented to 1. If the character does not match, `j` remains 0. The program handles the case where `i` might be out of bounds or `s` is empty, ensuring that no out-of-bounds errors occur.***
