The value of `j` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
