Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; and `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` of string `s` matches the character at index `j` of the string `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` does not match, `j` remains unchanged.***
