The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`. The value of `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which has a length of 26. The variable `s` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**
