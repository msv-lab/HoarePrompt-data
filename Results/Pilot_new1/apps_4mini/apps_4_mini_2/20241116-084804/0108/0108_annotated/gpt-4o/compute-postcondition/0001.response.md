The variable `target` is assigned the value of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, which is a fixed string of all lowercase English letters. The initial state of the variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `s` and the new assignment of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
