According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `target_len` is 26. However, we do not have the current value of `j`. For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:

1. `i` must be less than `len(s)`, which is true since `s` has a length between 1 and 100,000.
2. `j` must be less than `target_len` (which is 26). 

Since we don't have the current value of `j`, we cannot determine if `j` is less than 26. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is less than 26 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; and `j` is less than 26**
