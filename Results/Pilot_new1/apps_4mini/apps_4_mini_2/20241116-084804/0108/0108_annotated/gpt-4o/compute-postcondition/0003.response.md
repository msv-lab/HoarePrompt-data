The variables `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0. The initial values of `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables, including the newly assigned values of `i` and `j`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
