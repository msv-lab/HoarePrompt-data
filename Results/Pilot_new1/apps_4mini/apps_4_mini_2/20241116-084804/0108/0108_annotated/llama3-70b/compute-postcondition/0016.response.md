The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that is one position after `char` in the Unicode table. The value of `char` is 'b', so `ord(char)` gives the Unicode code point for 'b', which is 98. Adding 1 gives 99, and `chr(99)` corresponds to 'c'. Therefore, `s` will change from 'b' to 'c'. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation.

The output state is: `s` contains 'c', `res` contains 'ab', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` contains 'c', `res` contains 'ab', `char` is 'b'**
