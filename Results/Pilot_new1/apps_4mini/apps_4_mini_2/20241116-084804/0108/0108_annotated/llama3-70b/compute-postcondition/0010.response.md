The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. Since `char` is 'a', `res` becomes 'aaa'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
