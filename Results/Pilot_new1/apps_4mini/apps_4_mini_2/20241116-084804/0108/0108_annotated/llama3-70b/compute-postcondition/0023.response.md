According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'cc', and `char` is 'b'. Since 'b' is not in 'cc', the loop cannot execute again. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to a character that is present in `s`. Therefore, `char` should be adjusted to 'c'.

State: **`s` is 'cc', `res` is 'abbb', `char` is 'c'**
