Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string `res` by including each character from 'a' to 'z' based on their frequency in `s`, replacing each occurrence of a character with the next character in the Unicode sequence. If `s` contains all 26 letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, it prints `res`. If `s` does not contain any letters from 'a' to 'z', or if `res` does not contain exactly 26 characters, it prints -1. The function does not handle cases where `s` contains uppercase letters or non-alphabetical characters, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
