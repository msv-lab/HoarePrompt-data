The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the ASCII sequence. Since `char` is 'c', `ord(char)` gives the ASCII value of 'c', which is 99. Adding 1 gives 100, and `chr(100)` corresponds to 'd'. 

The string `s` will have the first 'c' replaced with 'd'. The variable `res` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated string `s` and the unchanged state of `res` and `char`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include 'c', `s` contains characters starting from 'd', and `char` is 'c'**
