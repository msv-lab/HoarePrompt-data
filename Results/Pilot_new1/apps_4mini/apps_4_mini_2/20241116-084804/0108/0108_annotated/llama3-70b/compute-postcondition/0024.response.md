Output State: **`if s contains 'b' then res is 'a' repeated according to the count of 'b' in the original s, s will eventually contain characters starting from 'c' and incrementing for each 'b' found, and char will be 'b' at the end. If s does not contain 'b', the loop doesn't execute and res remains the initial value with 'a' repeated according to the count in s.`**
