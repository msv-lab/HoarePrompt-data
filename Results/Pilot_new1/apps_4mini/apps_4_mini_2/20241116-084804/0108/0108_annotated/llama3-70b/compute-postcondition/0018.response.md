The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. The previous value of `res` is 'ab' and the value of `char` is 'b'. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'ab' + 'b' = 'abb'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` contains 'b', `res` contains 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
