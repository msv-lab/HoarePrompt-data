The value of `res` is updated to include `char`, which is 'c'. Therefore, the new value of `res` becomes the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'c'. The states of `s` and `char` remain unaffected. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include 'c', `s` contains characters starting from 'c', `char` is 'c' and `res` is now the previous value of `res` concatenated with 'c'.**
