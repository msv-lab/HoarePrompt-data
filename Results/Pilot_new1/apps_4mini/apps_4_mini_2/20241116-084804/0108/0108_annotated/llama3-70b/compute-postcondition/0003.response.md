According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet`, which consists of 26 lowercase English letters. The state of `s` and `res` does not affect the execution of the loop since the loop iterates over the fixed `alphabet` string. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to establish the initial state of `char` as it will iterate over the `alphabet`. At the start of the loop, `char` will take the value of the first character in the `alphabet`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `char` should be initialized to the first character of `alphabet`, which is 'a'. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
