The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` can either be 0 or 1, so after execution, `j` will either be 1 or 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 1 or 2.
