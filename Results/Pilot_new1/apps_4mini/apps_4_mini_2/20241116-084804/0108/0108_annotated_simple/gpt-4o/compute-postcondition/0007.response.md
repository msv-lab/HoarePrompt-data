The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` will be 1. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the match with the first character of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the match with the first character of `target`.**
