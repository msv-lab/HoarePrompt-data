According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, and `j`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Since `s` is a string with a length greater than 2, `len(s)` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)` and `j` must be less than `target_len`.

Since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)`. If `len(s)` is 3, then `i` must be less than 3, which means it could have been 2 before the increment. If `len(s)` is greater than 3, then `i` could be 3 or less before the increment. 

The condition for `j` is not specified, so we cannot make any assumptions about it. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `target_len`.

Thus, we can conclude that `i` must be less than `len(s)` and `j` must be less than `target_len`. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `i` is less than len(s); `j` is less than target_len**
