The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing `i` from 1 to 2. The other variables `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, and `j` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, and `j` is either 0 or 1**
