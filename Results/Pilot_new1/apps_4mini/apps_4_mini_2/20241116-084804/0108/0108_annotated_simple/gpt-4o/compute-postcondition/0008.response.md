According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will execute if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `target_len` is 26. For the loop to execute one more time:

1. The variable `i` must be less than the length of the string `s`. If `len(s)` is greater than 1, then `i` is already less than `len(s)`, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
2. The variable `j` must be less than `target_len`. Since `j` is either 0 or 1, it is already less than 26, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the variables `i`, `j`, or `target_len`. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1**
