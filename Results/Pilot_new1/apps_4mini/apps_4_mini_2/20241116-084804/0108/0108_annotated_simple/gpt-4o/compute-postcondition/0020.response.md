Postcondition: ***`s` can be empty, or contain characters but not all from `target`. If `s` is empty, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. If `s` contains characters but not all from `target`, then `i` is the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26. In either case, `j` is less than 26, indicating that not all characters from `target` are matched.***
