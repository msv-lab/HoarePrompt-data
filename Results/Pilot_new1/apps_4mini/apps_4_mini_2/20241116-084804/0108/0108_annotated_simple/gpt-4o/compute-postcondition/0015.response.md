The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables, `s` and `target`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `i` is increased by 1**
