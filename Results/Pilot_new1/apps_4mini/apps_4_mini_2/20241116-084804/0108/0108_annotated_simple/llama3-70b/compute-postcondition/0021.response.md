The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The previous state of `res` is not specified, but it is being updated with the addition of `char`. The variable `char` is still present in `s`, indicating that it has not been removed from `s`. Furthermore, `s` has had the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the Unicode sequence, but this does not directly affect the value of `res` after this operation.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated with the addition of `char`, `char` is still in `s`, and `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the Unicode sequence.

Output State: **`res` is updated with the addition of `char`, `char` is still in `s`, and `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the Unicode sequence.**
