The function accepts a string input `s` containing lowercase English letters. It processes `s` by replacing each character from 'a' to 'z' with the next character in the Unicode sequence, collecting these replaced characters in the string `res`. If `res` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet by the end of processing, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` contains characters beyond 'z', those characters remain unchanged, and if `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` remains empty and -1 is printed. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints results.
