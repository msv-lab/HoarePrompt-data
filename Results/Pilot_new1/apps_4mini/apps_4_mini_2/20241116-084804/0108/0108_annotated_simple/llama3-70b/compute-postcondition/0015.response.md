The code appends `char`, which is 'z', to `res`. Since `res` is a string that already contains characters from `s`, it will now include 'z' at the end. The previous state of `res` is not specified, but it is impacted by the addition of 'z'. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `res`.

Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of the characters from `s` that are sequentially replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and now includes 'z' at the end.**
