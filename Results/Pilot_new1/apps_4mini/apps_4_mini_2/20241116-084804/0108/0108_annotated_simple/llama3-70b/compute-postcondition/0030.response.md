The code `s = s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table. Since `s` contains `char`, it will be updated accordingly. The previous value of `s` is not specified, but it is implied that it includes `char`. 

After executing the code, `s` will have its first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character. The variable `res` is not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is updated to include `char`, `s` has its first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in the ASCII sequence.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` has its first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in the ASCII sequence.**
