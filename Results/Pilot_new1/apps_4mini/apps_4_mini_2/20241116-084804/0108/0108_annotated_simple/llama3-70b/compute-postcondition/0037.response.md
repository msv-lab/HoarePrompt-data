Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of all characters from the original `s` that were sequentially replaced by the next character in the alphabet, starting from 'a' to 'z'. The final value of `s` will be the original string with all instances of each character replaced by the next character in the Unicode sequence, up to the last character processed. If `s` does not contain any characters from the alphabet, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string. If `s` contains characters beyond 'z', those characters will remain unchanged in `s`, and `res` will only contain the characters that were processed. If `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string while `s` will remain unchanged.**
