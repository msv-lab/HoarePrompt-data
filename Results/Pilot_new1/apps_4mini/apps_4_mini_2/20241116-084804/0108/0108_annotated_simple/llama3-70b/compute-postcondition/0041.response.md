The code contains a print statement that outputs `-1`. The variables do not change state as a result of this operation. The previous state of `res` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is a string consisting of characters from the original `s` that were replaced by the next character in the alphabet, and the length of `res` is less than 26; `s` remains unchanged or contains characters beyond 'z'; if `s` contains lowercase letters, not all of them were processed; if `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` is an empty string; and the function prints -1.
