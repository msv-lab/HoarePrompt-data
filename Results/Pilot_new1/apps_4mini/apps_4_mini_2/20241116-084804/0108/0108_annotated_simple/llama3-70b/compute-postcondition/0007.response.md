The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'a', and `char` is 'b', so after execution, `res` becomes 'ab'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is the string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'**
