According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` has been updated to the next character in the ASCII table. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in `s`.

Since `char` was updated to the next character, we need to ensure that this new `char` is still in `s`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `char` is still found in `s` after being updated.

State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character, and `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII table and char is in s**
