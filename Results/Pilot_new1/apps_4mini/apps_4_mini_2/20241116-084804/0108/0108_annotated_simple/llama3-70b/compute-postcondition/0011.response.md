The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The current value of `s` is 'b', and `char` is also 'b'. The `ord(char)` function gives the ASCII value of 'b', which is 98. Adding 1 to this gives 99, and `chr(99)` results in 'c'. Therefore, `s` will be updated from 'b' to 'c'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
