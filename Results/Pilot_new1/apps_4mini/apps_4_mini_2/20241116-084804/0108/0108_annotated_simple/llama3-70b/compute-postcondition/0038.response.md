Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of all characters from the original `s` that were sequentially replaced by the next character in the alphabet, with a total length of 26 characters. The string `s` has been modified such that all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' have been replaced by their subsequent characters in the Unicode sequence, and any characters beyond 'z' remain unchanged. If `s` contained lowercase letters, it must have originally included all letters from 'a' to 'z' to achieve this length in `res`.***
