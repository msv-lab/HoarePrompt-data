Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the string `s` can be transformed to include the English alphabet as a subsequence, but is not in the correct order or not all characters are present. For instance, consider the input `aaabcde`, where `s` contains the characters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`. The program checks if the characters of `s` can match the target string `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` in order, but it fails to recognize that it can transform `aaabcde` into `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` by replacing characters. 

Additionally, the program does not account for the fact that characters in `s` can be replaced to reach the next character in the alphabet, but it only checks for direct matches. Therefore, it does not correctly fulfill the requirement of the problem description to print a valid transformed string if possible. 

For example, with the input `aaabcde`, the expected output should be `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`, but the program would output `-1` instead. This demonstrates that the program is not correct as it does not handle all edge cases properly.
