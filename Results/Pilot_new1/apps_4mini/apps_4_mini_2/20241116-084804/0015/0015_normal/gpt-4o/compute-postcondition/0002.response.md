The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as this statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, and 'YES' is printed**
