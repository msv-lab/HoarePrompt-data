The code prints 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0; 'NO' is printed**.
