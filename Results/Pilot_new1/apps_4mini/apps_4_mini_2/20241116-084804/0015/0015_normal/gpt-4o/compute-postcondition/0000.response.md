The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from the input, which are processed by the `map` function and converted to integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, so we cannot determine their new values without the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now replaced by the input integers.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are replaced by new input integers**
