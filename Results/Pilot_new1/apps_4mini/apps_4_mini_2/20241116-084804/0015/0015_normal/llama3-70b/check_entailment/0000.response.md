To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the problem requirements step by step.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- We need to determine if the integer `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence defined by:
  - First element `s_1 = a`
  - Common difference `c`
- We should print "YES" if `b` is in the sequence, otherwise print "NO".

**Program Code:**
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

**Code Analysis:**
1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`).
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints "YES" if they are equal, otherwise "NO".
   - This part is correct.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to ensure that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` multiple times.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that moving from `a` to `b` is in the correct direction (i.e., `b` is not behind `a` if `c` is positive, or `b` is not ahead of `a` if `c` is negative).
   - This part is also correct.

**Edge Cases Considered:**
- If `a = b` and `c = 0`, the output is "YES", which is correct.
- If `a != b` and `c = 0`, the output is "NO", which is correct.
- If `b` is reachable from `a` given a non-zero `c`, the checks ensure correctness.
- If `b` is not reachable, the program correctly outputs "NO".

**Output Hints Verification:**
The output hints describe the program's behavior accurately:
- It checks the conditions for `c == 0` and for non-zero `c`.
- It correctly identifies when `b` is in the sequence based on the conditions described.

**Conclusion:**
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c` for all potential cases described in the problem. 

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
