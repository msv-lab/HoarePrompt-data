The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` does not change, and since the conditions given in the initial state are satisfied (the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result is a non-negative integer), the output is simply the printed string. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the function prints 'YES'**
