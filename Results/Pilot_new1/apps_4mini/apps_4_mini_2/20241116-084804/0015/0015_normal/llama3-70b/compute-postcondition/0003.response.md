The code prints 'YES', which does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The previous state remains unchanged, so the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `c` is 0; `a` is equal to `b`, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the value of `c` is 0; `a` is equal to `b`, and 'YES' is printed.**
