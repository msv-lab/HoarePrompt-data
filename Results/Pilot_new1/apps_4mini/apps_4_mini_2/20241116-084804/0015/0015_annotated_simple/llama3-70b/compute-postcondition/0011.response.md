The code prints 'NO', and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The conditions state that `c` is not equal to 0 and that either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c`, or the quotient `(b - a) / c` is negative. Therefore, the output state is `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and the code prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and the code prints 'NO'**
