Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It checks if `c` is equal to 0; if so, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer; it prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This includes all scenarios where `(b - a)` can be negative, zero, or positive, ensuring comprehensive coverage of edge cases. **
