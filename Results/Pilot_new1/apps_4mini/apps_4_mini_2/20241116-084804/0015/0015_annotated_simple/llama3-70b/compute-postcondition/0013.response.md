Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0, the function prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not equal to 0, the function prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, and 'NO' otherwise. This includes all scenarios where `(b - a)` can be negative, zero, or positive, ensuring comprehensive coverage of edge cases.***
