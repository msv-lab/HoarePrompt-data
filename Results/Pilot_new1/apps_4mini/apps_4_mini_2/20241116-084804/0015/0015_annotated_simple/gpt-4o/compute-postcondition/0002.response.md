The code prints 'YES', and it does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The previous value of `b` is equal to `a`, but since the print statement does not affect any variables, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is equal to `a`, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is equal to `a`, and 'YES' is printed.**
