Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, in which case it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result based on these conditions. **
