The `print` statement outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged during this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0; and the output is 'NO'**
