The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change as a result of this statement. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is not equal to 0; and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is negative; and the function prints 'NO'**
