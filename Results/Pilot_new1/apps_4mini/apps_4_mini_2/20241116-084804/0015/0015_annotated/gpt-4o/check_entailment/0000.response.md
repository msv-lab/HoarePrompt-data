To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to determine if a given integer `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The common difference `c`

The sequence can be expressed as:
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for `i = 1, 2, 3, ...`

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Code Analysis
The code checks the following conditions:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it immediately returns "YES".
2. If `c` is 0, it checks if `b` is not equal to `a` and returns "NO" (since the sequence would be constant).
3. If `c` is not 0, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (which means that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` some number of times) and also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` (which ensures that the index `i` is positive).

### Edge Cases
1. **When `c = 0`**: The sequence is constant (`a, a, a, ...`). The only time "YES" is returned is when `b = a`. If `b` is different from `a`, it correctly returns "NO".
  
2. **When `c > 0`**: The sequence is increasing. The conditions `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensure that `b` can be reached from `a` by stepping forward by `c`. This is correct.

3. **When `c < 0`**: The sequence is decreasing. The code does not explicitly handle this case, but the conditions still apply:
   - `(b - a) % c == 0` checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by stepping back by `|c|`.
   - `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that `b` is indeed less than or equal to `a` since stepping backwards would not allow `b` to be greater than `a`.

### Annotations Review
The annotations summarize the logic of the code:
- They correctly identify the conditions for returning "YES" or "NO".
- They confirm that if `b` is equal to `a`, the output is "YES".
- They also state that if `c` is 0 and `b` is not equal to `a`, the output is "NO".
- The annotations also correctly describe the conditions for when `c` is non-zero.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering all potential cases (including edge cases and the behavior of the arithmetic sequence), the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly handles all specified cases, including the edge cases outlined in the problem description.
