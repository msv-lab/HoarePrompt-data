The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown as they will be replaced by the input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers input by the user.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers input by the user**
