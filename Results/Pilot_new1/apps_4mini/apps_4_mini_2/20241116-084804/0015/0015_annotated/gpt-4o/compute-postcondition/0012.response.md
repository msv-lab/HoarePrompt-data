Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with `(b - a) / c` being greater than or equal to 0, the output is 'YES'. In all other cases, including when `c` is not 0 but either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output is 'NO'.***
