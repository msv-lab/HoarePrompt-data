The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input from the user and checks the following conditions: If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and whether `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; if both conditions are true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
