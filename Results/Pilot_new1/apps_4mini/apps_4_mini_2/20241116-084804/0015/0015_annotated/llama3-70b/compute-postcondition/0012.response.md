Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9 and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division (i.e., (b - a) / c) is greater than or equal to 0, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if the difference is not divisible by `c` or the result of the division is less than 0, the program prints 'NO'.***
