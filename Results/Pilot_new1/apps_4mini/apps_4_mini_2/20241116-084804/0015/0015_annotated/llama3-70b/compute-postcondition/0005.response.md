The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned input integer values based on the user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is equal to 0, and `a` is not equal to `b`, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned input integer values based on the user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is equal to 0, and `a` is not equal to `b`, and the program prints 'NO'.**
