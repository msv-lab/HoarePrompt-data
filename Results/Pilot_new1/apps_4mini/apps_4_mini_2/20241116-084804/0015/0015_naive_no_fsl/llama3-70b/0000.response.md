Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Vasya's favorite integer \( b \) appears in the sequence defined by the first element \( a \) and the common difference \( c \). 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **When \( c = 0 \)**:
   - The sequence consists of the constant value \( a \). The program checks if \( a \) is equal to \( b \). If they are equal, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This is correct as the sequence does not change and only contains the value \( a \).

2. **When \( c \neq 0 \)**:
   - The program checks if \( (b - a) \) is divisible by \( c \) (i.e., \( (b - a) \% c == 0 \)). This ensures that \( b \) can be reached from \( a \) by adding \( c \) repeatedly.
   - It also checks if \( (b - a) / c \) is non-negative, which ensures that the number of steps from \( a \) to \( b \) is a positive integer. This is necessary because the sequence only includes positive indices.

The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. The examples given in the problem description match the output of the program, confirming its correctness. 

Thus, I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
