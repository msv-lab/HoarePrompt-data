The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and its last digit is greater than 5, the value of `n % 10` will be between 6 and 9. Therefore, the term `(10 - n % 10)` will yield values from 1 to 4, which will be added to `n`. 

This means that the output will be the next multiple of 10 after `n`. The original value of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, and the output is `n + (10 - n % 10)` which is the next multiple of 10 after `n`.**
