The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively removes the last digit of `n` by subtracting the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10 and its last digit is less than or equal to 5, the value of `n - n % 10` will give us the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. The original value of `n` is not altered by this operation, and the result will be printed.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5; the printed output is `n - n % 10`.**
