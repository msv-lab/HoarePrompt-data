The code prints the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and is a multiple of 10, the output state reflects the value of `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is a multiple of 10, and the function prints `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is a multiple of 10, and the function prints `n`**
