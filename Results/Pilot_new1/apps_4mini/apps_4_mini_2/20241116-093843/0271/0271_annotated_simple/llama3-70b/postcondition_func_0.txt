The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`. The function does not return any value.
