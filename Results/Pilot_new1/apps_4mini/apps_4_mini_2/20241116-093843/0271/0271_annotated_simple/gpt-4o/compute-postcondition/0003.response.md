The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Since `remainder` is defined as the last digit of `n`, it can take values from 0 to 5 (inclusive). Therefore, the value of `result` will be `n` minus a value that is less than or equal to 5. The output state reflects the values of `n`, `remainder`, and the newly calculated `result`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is `n - remainder`.**
