The value of `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, which is greater than 5. Therefore, the possible values for `remainder` are 6, 7, 8, or 9. 

The expression `result = n + (10 - remainder)` calculates `result` based on the value of `remainder`. 

- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`.
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`.
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`.
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`.

Since `n` can be any non-negative integer up to 10^9, the output state will include the ranges for `result` based on the possible values of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and the last digit of `n` is greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.**
