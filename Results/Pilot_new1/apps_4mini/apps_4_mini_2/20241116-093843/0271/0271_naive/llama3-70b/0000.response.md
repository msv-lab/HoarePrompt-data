To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem requires rounding a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The rounding rules are:
1. If `n` ends with 0, it should remain unchanged.
2. If `n` ends with a digit less than or equal to 5, it should round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
3. If `n` ends with a digit greater than 5, it should round up to the nearest multiple of 10.

Now, let's look at the provided program:

```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Case when `n` ends with 0**: The code correctly checks if `n % 10 == 0` and prints `n`, which is correct.

2. **Case when `n` ends with a digit less than or equal to 5**: The code checks if `n % 10 <= 5` and rounds down by printing `n - n % 10`. This is also correct.

3. **Case when `n` ends with a digit greater than 5**: The code checks if `n % 10 > 5` and rounds up by printing `n + (10 - n % 10)`. This is correct.

### Edge Cases

- **Minimum Input (n = 0)**: The code will print `0`, which is correct.
- **Exact multiples of 10 (e.g., n = 10, 20, ...)**: The code will correctly return the same number.
- **Numbers just below a multiple of 10 (e.g., n = 9, 19, ...)**: The code will round up to the next multiple of 10.
- **Numbers just above a multiple of 10 (e.g., n = 11, 21, ...)**: The code will round down to the previous multiple of 10.

### Conclusion

After reviewing all potential cases, the program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. There are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program handles all specified cases correctly and provides valid outputs according to the problem description.
