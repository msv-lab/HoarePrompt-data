The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no parameters provided in the function definition, we cannot determine how `n` is utilized or what the function returns based on the provided output information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined without additional context regarding the use of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
