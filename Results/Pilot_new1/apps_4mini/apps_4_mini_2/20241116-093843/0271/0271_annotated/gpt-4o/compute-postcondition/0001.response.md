The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be the last digit of `n`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n**
