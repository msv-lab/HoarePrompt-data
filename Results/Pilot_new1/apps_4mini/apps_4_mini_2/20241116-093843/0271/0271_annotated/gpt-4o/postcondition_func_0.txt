The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` from the user, calculates the last digit (remainder) of `n`, and rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it returns `n` rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10; if the last digit is greater than 5, it returns `n` rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10. The function does not return any value but prints the result instead.
