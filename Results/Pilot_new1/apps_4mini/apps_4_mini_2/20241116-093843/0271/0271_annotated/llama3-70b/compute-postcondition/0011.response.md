Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` input by the user and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, it prints the next multiple of 10 after `n`. The function does not return any value. **
