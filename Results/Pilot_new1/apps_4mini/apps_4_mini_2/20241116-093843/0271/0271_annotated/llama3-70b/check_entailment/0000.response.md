To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations in conjunction with the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. The rules are:
1. If `n` already ends with 0, return `n`.
2. If `n` does not end with 0, round it down to the nearest multiple of 10 if the last digit is 0-5, and round it up to the nearest multiple of 10 if the last digit is 6-9.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n % 10 == 0) :
        print(n)
    else :
        if (n % 10 <= 5) :
            print(n - n % 10)
        else :
            print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Annotations Recap:
1. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`.
2. If `n` is not divisible by 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`.
3. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, it prints the next multiple of 10 after `n`.

### Evaluation of the Code Against the Problem Description:
1. **Case when `n` ends with 0**: The code correctly returns `n` as required.
2. **Case when `n` ends with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5**:
   - The code correctly rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10. For example, if `n = 5`, it will print `0`, which is a valid option according to the problem description.
3. **Case when `n` ends with 6, 7, 8, or 9**:
   - The code correctly rounds up to the next multiple of 10. For example, if `n = 7`, it will print `10`, which is valid.

### Edge Cases:
- The code handles edge cases such as `n = 0`, which correctly returns `0`.
- The maximum input value of `n = 10^9` is also handled as it will either return `10^9` (if divisible by 10) or round to the nearest multiple of 10.

### Conclusion:
The program covers all cases as specified in the problem description. The annotations align with the behavior of the code, confirming that it correctly implements the rounding logic for all possible inputs within the specified range.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
