The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` from user input, rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10, and prints the result. If the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down; if it is greater than 5, it rounds up. The function does not return any value but outputs the rounded result directly.
