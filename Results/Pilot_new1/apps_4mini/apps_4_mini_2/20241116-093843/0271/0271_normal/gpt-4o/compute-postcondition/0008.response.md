The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on an internal logic that utilizes a non-negative integer `n` within the constraints of 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since the function does not take `n` as an argument, we cannot specify its role in the input. The function will return a value based on its internal processing of `n`. Since no specific output conditions are provided, we cannot detail the return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on internal processing of a non-negative integer n within the constraints 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
