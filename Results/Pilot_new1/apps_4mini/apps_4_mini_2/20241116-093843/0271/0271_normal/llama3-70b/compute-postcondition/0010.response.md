The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is defined to operate without input. Based on the provided constraints, the function is designed to handle a non-negative integer `n` that falls within the range of 0 to 10^9. However, since there are no parameters explicitly passed to the function, the specific behavior or output of the function is not defined in the output section. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or functionality without additional context or implementation details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified in the provided information.**
