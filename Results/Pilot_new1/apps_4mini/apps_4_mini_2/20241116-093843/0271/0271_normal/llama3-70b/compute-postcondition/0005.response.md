The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively removes the last digit of `n`, rounding it down to the nearest multiple of 10. Given the constraints that `n` is a non-negative integer not a multiple of 10 and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the value of `n` can range from 1 to 9 (inclusive) or any non-multiple of 10 that ends with 1 through 5 (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, ..., 19, etc.).

The expression `n - n % 10` will yield a value that is the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. 

Thus, the output state will reflect `n` and the computed result of `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the result is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.**
