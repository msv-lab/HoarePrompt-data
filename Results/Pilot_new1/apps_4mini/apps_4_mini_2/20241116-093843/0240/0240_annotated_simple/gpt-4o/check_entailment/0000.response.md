To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic carefully.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It calculates `n_len`, which is the expected length of the original number `n` by subtracting the length of the substring `sub` from the length of the string `s`.
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in both `s` and `sub`.
   - It then decrements the counts in `s_counter` based on the counts in `sub_counter`.
   - The remaining characters are collected into `remaining_chars`.
   - It calls `generate_possible_numbers` to create all possible numbers from the remaining characters and the substring.
   - Finally, it returns the smallest number from the generated candidates.

2. **Function 2 (`is_valid_number`)**:
   - This function checks if the substring `sub` is contained in the candidate number and if the length of the candidate number matches `n_len`.

3. **Function 3 (`generate_possible_numbers`)**:
   - It generates all permutations of the `chars` string and yields those that are valid according to `is_valid_number`.

### Potential Issues
- The approach of generating all permutations of the remaining characters can lead to performance issues, especially since the input string can be as long as 1,000,000 characters. This could lead to an exponential number of permutations, making the program infeasible for larger inputs.
- The program does not handle leading zeros correctly in the context of the final number `n`. For instance, if the remaining characters after removing `sub` contain leading zeros, the generated number might start with a zero, which is invalid unless the number is exactly zero.
  
### Example Case
Consider the input:
```
000012
01
```
- Here, the expected output should be `1002` (as `n` should not have leading zeros), but the program might generate candidates like `000012` or `000021`, which are invalid as they contain leading zeros.

### Conclusion
Since the program fails to correctly handle cases involving leading zeros and potentially generates invalid numbers, it does not satisfy the problem description in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
