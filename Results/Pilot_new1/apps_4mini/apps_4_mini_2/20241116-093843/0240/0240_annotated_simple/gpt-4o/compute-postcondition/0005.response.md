According to the code, the loop will execute for each permutation of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` must be generated. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, the next permutation would need to be determined based on the order of permutations generated by the `permutations` function. 

Given that `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, the next state will involve updating `perm` to the next permutation of `chars`. There is no need to change `candidate` since it will be updated to match the new `perm` in the next iteration.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
