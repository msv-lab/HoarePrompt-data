Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`. It generates all permutations of `chars` and yields those permutations that are valid numbers according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string or contains only leading zeroes, no valid candidates may be yielded. The function does not explicitly insert `sub` into `chars`, but rather checks the validity of the permutations of `chars` against `sub`. **
