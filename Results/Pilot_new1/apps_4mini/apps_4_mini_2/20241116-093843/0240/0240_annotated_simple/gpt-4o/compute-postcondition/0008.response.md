Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, no value is yielded.***
