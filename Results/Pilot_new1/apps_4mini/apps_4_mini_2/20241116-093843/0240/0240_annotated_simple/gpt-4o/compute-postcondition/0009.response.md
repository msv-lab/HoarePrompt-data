According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more permutations to iterate over. 

Since `perm` is currently the second permutation, to execute one more time, we need to adjust `perm` to the next permutation in the sequence. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements, so we need to make sure that `perm` reflects the next permutation after the second one.

However, we also need to consider that `chars` must still be a string of digits with at least 1 character, and the overall state of `candidate` may remain unchanged if it is not valid. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
1. `perm` should be the third permutation of `chars`.
2. `candidate` should be updated to reflect the new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
