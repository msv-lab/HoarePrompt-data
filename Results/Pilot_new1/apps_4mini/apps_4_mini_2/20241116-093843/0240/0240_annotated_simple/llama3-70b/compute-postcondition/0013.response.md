Output State: **`n` contains the concatenation of all characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `n` remains an empty string. If `s` contains no characters that are in `t_set`, then `n` will also remain an empty string. If `s` contains characters that match those in `t_set`, then `n` will be updated accordingly.**
