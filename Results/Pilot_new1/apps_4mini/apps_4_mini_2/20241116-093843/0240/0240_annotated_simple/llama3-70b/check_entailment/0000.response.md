To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have a string `s` which is a shuffled version of an integer `n` followed by its digit count `k`.
2. We also have a substring `t` of `n`.
3. The goal is to construct the smallest possible integer `n` that can contain `t` as a substring and can be formed from the characters in `s`.

### Provided Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    n += t
    return int(n)
```

#### Step-by-step Analysis:
1. **Character Filtering**: The code creates a set `t_set` from the substring `t`. It then iterates through each character `c` in `s`, appending `c` to `n` if `c` is found in `t_set`. This means `n` will only contain characters from `s` that are also in `t`.
2. **Appending Substring**: After the loop, it appends `t` to `n`.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The code does not handle leading zeros properly. By appending `t` directly to `n`, it could lead to `n` having leading zeros if `n` starts with a zero and `t` is non-zero. For example:
   - Input: `s = "003512"`, `t = "021"`
   - The characters from `s` that are in `t` would be `0`, `0`, `2`, `1`, leading to `n = "0021"`, and appending `t` gives `n = "0021" + "021" = "0021021"`, which is incorrect as it does not form a valid integer `n` without leading zeros.
   - The expected output should be `30021`, but the current logic fails to ensure that `n` is the smallest valid integer without leading zeros.

2. **Smallest Integer Logic**: The program does not ensure that it constructs the smallest integer `n`. Simply filtering characters from `s` that are in `t` and appending `t` does not guarantee that the final integer is the smallest possible configuration.

### Conclusion:
The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, particularly with regard to handling leading zeros and ensuring the smallest integer is formed.

Correctness: **False**
