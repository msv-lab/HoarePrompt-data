To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it adheres to the problem description.

The problem requires us to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` and a substring `t` of `n`. The key points to consider are:

1. The resulting `n` must be formed from the digits in `s` and must include the digits in `t`.
2. The output should be the smallest possible integer `n`, which means we need to ensure that digits are arranged in a way that the integer formed is minimized.
3. The final output should not have leading zeros unless the integer is zero itself.

Let's break down the provided code:

```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)
print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Usage of `set(t)`**: The code creates a set of characters from `t`, which is used to filter characters from `s`. This means that only characters that are present in `t` will be appended to `n`.

2. **Appending `t` to `n`**: After filtering, the entire substring `t` is appended to `n`. This does not guarantee that the resulting number is the smallest possible integer because the digits collected from `s` may not be in the correct order.

3. **Returning `int(n)`**: This converts the string `n` into an integer, which removes any leading zeros. However, this might not yield the correct smallest integer representation if the order of digits in `n` is not optimal.

### Potential Case Where the Code Fails:

Let's consider a specific case:

- Input:
```
s = "003512"
t = "021"
```

The expected smallest integer `n` should be `30021`, but let's see what the code does:

1. The set of `t` is `{'0', '2', '1'}`.
2. The loop will append the characters from `s` that are in `t`, which will result in `n` being `0021` (it collects `0` from `s` twice, and then `2` and `1`).
3. After appending `t`, `n` becomes `0021` + `021` which results in `0021021` before converting to an integer.
4. When converted to an integer, it becomes `21021`, which is incorrect as it does not yield the smallest possible integer.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly construct the smallest integer `n` as required by the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
