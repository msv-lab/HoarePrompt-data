The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty string `t` of digits. It constructs a new string `n` that consists of the digits from `s` that are also present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. The function then returns the integer value of this concatenated string. If `s` contains no digits that match those in `t`, the function will return the integer value of `t` alone.
