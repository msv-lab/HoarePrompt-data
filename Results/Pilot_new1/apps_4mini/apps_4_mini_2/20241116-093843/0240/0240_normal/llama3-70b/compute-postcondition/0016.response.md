The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and `t` is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes. The function returns the integer value of the string `n`, which contains the digits from `s` that are also present in `t` concatenated with `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty string `t` of digits, and returns the integer value of the concatenation of the digits from `s` that are also in `t` with `t`.**
