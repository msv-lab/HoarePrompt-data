The variable `n` is concatenated with `c`. Since `n` is a string that may contain the second character of `s`, the value of `c` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but `c` can be assumed to be a character. The concatenation operation will result in a new string that includes the character `c` added to the end of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least one more character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is now the original value of `n` concatenated with `c`**
