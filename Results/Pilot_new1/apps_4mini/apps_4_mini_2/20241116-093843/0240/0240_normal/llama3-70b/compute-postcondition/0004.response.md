The variable `n` is assigned the value of `n + c`, where `c` is the first character of `s` and is also an element of `t_set`. Since `n` is initially an empty string, concatenating `c` to `n` results in `n` being equal to `c`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is `c`, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `c` is an element of `t_set`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is `c`, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `c` is an element of `t_set`**
