The first input is a string of digits (s) with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and the second input is a non-empty substring (sub) of n, which may contain leading zeroes. The string s contains the digits of n and the integer k, which is the number of digits in n. The final integer n must have no leading zeroes unless it is the single digit '0'.
