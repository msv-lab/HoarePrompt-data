The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be a string formed by the digits in `chars` arranged in the order of the first permutation. The value of `chars` is not affected, but `candidate` is now defined. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 digit, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
