Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function when checked against `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. There are no actions taken if `candidate` is not valid, so it does not yield any value in that case.***
