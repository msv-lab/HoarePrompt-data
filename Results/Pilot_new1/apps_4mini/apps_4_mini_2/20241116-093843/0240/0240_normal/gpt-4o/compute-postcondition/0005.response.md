According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` string and the permutations generated from it. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. 

Since `candidate` is formed by joining `perm`, it will also need to be updated accordingly. The loop will continue to iterate until all permutations of `chars` have been exhausted.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` will also need to reflect this new permutation.

Since we don't have specific information about the next permutation, we can indicate that `perm` is now the next permutation of `chars` and `candidate` is the corresponding string formed by that permutation.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 digit, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
