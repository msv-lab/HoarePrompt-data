According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. Since permutations are generated in a specific order, the next permutation after `perm` must be the next one in that order.

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- The loop will continue until all permutations of `chars` have been exhausted.
- The last permutation generated will be the final one, after which there are no more permutations to generate.

Since `perm` is currently the next permutation of `chars`, for the loop to execute again, `perm` must be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. Therefore, we need to indicate that `perm` is now the next permutation after the current one.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `chars` remains the same, and `candidate` is derived from `perm` during each iteration.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the next permutation of `chars`**
