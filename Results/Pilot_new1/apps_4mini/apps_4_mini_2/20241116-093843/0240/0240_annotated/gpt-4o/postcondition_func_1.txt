The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns `True` if `sub` is found within `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. However, the variable `n_len` is not defined within the function, which will lead to a NameError when the function is executed. Therefore, the function is not fully functional as intended.
