According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `permutations` of `chars`. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation of `chars`, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence generated by `permutations(chars)`.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and since permutations generate all possible arrangements, the next permutation will be the second permutation of `chars`. The `candidate` will also need to be updated to reflect this new `perm`.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `perm` should be updated to the second permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` should also be updated to the same value as `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.**
