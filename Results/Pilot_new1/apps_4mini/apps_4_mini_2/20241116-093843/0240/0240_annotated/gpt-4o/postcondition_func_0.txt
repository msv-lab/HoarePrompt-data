The function accepts a string of digits `s` and a non-empty string of digits `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the occurrences of characters found in `sub`. It then generates a list of possible numbers from the remaining characters and returns the smallest number from that list. However, if there are no valid characters left in `s` after the removal process, the function may raise an error when trying to find the minimum of an empty list. Therefore, it lacks error handling for this edge case.
