According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The state at the end of the last iteration indicates that `perm` is currently the third permutation of `chars`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the number of permutations generated from `chars`.

If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the total number of permutations is equal to the factorial of the length of `chars`. Since `perm` is the third permutation, for the loop to execute again, there must be at least four permutations available. 

The next permutation after the third would be the fourth permutation. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `perm` is now the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` should also be updated to match this new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.**
