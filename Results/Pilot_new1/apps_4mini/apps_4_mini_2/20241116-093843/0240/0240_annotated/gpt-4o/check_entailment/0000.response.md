Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated in the description. Here are the issues identified:

1. **Error Handling**: The function `func_1` lacks error handling for the case when there are no valid characters left in `s` after removing the occurrences of characters found in `sub`. If `remaining_chars` is empty, `generate_possible_numbers` would be called with an empty string, leading to no candidates being generated, which could result in a failure to find the minimum.

2. **Undefined Variable**: In the function `is_valid_number`, the variable `n_len` is referenced but not defined within the function. This will lead to a `NameError` when the function is executed, making it non-functional.

3. **Permutation Logic**: The `generate_possible_numbers` function generates permutations of `chars`, but it does not ensure that the length of the resulting number is correct according to the problem constraints (i.e., the number of digits in `n` must match the expected length). Moreover, it does not account for leading zeros correctly when generating candidates.

4. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states that the number `n` should not have leading zeros unless it is the number zero itself. The current implementation does not check for this condition when generating possible numbers.

Given these points, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in multiple scenarios, particularly regarding error handling and the proper construction of valid numbers. Thus, it is deemed incorrect.
