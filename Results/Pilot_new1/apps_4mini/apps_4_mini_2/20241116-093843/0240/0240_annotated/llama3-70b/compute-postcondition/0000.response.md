The code creates a set from the substring `t`, which removes any duplicate characters and allows for efficient membership testing. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string of digits, and `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`. The variable `t_set` will hold the unique characters from `t`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`.**
