Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where there is an equal number of upvotes and downvotes when considering the unknown votes. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1 1 1
```
In this case:
- Minimum upvotes = 1
- Maximum upvotes = 1 + 1 = 2
- Minimum downvotes = 1
- Maximum downvotes = 1 + 1 = 2

Here, it is possible to have:
1. 2 upvotes (if the unknown person upvotes), which results in "+".
2. 1 upvote and 2 downvotes (if the unknown person downvotes), which results in "-".
3. 1 upvote and 1 downvote (if the unknown person does not vote), which results in "0".

Since there are different possible outcomes, the result should be uncertain ("?"). However, the program would incorrectly classify this case as uncertain by outputting "?" due to the overlapping ranges, but it does not explicitly check for the scenario where there are equal upvotes and downvotes. 

Thus, the program fails for this input case, and therefore it is incorrect.
