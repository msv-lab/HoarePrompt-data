The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers, and `min_upvotes` has already been assigned the value of `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `y` and `min_upvotes`, as well as the new value of `max_upvotes`, which is the sum of `x` and `z`.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`**.
