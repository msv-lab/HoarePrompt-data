Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'; otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`, the output is '?'. This captures the edge case where `max_downvotes` equals `min_upvotes`, ensuring all scenarios are addressed.***
