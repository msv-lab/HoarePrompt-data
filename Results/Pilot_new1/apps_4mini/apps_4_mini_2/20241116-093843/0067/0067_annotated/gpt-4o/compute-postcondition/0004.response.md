The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The initial values of `y` and `z` are input integers, and they remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_downvotes` is calculated based on the current values of `y` and `z`. 

The output state reflects the values of the variables after the assignment:

- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `z` is an input integer
- `min_upvotes` is `x`
- `max_upvotes` is `x + z`
- `min_downvotes` is `y`
- `max_downvotes` is `y + z`

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
