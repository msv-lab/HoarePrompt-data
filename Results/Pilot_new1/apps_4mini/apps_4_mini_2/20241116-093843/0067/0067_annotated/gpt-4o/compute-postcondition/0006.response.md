The code prints a hyphen ('-') but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, where `max_upvotes` equals `x + z` and `min_downvotes` equals `y`; printed output is '-'**
