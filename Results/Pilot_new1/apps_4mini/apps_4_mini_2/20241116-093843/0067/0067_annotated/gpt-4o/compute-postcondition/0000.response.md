The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a space-separated string input, splits it into individual components, converts each to an integer, and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, so they are replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in values for `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are replaced by input integers**
