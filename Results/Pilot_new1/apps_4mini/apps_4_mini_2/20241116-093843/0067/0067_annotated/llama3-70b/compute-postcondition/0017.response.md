Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, then '+' is printed. If `x` is less than `y`, then '-' is printed. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to `y + z`, then '?' is printed. In all cases, it is maintained that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).***
