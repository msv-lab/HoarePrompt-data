Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is equal to 0, the program prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not equal to 0, the program prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the program prints '?'. In all cases, it is maintained that `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (x <= y + z).***
