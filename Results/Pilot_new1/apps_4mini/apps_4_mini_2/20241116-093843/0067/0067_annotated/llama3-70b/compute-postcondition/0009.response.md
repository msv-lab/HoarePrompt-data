The code prints the string '0'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `z` is equal to 0, and '0' is printed**
