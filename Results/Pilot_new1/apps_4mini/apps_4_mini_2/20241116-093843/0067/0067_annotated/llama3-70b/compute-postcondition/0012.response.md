Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `z` is equal to 0, the program prints '0'. Otherwise, if `z` is not equal to 0, the program prints '?', while maintaining that the value of `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (x <= y + z).***
