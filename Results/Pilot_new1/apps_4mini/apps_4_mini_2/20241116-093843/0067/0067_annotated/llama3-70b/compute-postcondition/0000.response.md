The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The `map(int, input().split())` function will read a line of input, split it into individual components, convert each component to an integer, and then assign these integers to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, we can only indicate that they will be replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now the integers provided by the user.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are new integers provided by the user**
