The function reads three integers from input, representing upvotes and downvotes, and calculates minimum and maximum possible values for upvotes and downvotes. It then prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return a value; it only prints the results based on the conditions evaluated.
