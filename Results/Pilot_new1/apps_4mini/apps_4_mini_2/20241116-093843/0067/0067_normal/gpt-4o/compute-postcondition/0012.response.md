Postcondition: ***`min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, if `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, the program prints '?'.***
