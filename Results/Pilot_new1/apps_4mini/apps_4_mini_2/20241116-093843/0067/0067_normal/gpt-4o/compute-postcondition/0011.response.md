The `print('?')` statement outputs a string `?` to the console. It does not modify any of the existing variables, so their values remain unchanged. The output state reflects the current values of the variables as well as the action taken.

Output State: **`min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`, and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, and the output is '?'**
