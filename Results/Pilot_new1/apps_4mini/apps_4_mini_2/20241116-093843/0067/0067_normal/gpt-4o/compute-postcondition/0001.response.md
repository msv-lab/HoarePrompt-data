The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The value of `x` is an integer that can range from 0 to 100, but it is not specified what the current value of `x` is. Therefore, the output state reflects that `min_upvotes` is now equal to the value of `x`, while the values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to new integer values based on input; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`**.
