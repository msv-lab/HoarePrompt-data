Postcondition: ***`min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z < y`), a hyphen is printed. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z < x`), a plus sign is printed. Otherwise, if neither of these conditions hold, a question mark is printed. This captures all cases including when the values are equal, ensuring all edge cases are covered.***
