The `print('-')` statement outputs a string consisting of a single hyphen to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`**
