The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input and evaluates their relationship. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, or if `x` is greater than `y`. If `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` but greater than `y`, it also prints '?'. The function does not return any values.
