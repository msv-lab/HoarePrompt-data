The `print('+')` statement outputs the string `+` to the console. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is `+`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is `+`**
