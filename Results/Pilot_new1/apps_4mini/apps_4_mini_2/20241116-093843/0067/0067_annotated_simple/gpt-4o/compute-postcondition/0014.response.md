The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of these parameters is an integer constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, the output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return values or any conditions under which different outputs occur. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters x, y, and z, which are integers in the range from 0 to 100. The specific return values of the function are not provided.**
