The code executes a print statement that outputs a question mark. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and it prints '?'.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and it prints '?'**.
