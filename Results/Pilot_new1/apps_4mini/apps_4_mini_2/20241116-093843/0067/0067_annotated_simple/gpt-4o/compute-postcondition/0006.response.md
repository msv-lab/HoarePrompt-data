The code prints a hyphen (`'-'`). The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and a hyphen is printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; a hyphen is printed.**
