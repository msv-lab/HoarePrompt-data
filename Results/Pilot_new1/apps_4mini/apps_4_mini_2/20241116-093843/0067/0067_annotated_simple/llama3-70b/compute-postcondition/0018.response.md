The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It returns a value based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are integers constrained by the conditions 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Since the specific output or behavior based on these parameters is not provided, I cannot determine the exact return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate based on the internal state or values of `x`, `y`, and `z` without accepting any parameters directly.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the internal values of x, y, and z, which are integers in the range of 0 to 100.**
