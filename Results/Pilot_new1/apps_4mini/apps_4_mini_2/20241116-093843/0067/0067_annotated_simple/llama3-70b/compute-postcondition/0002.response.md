The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `+`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected by this operation, and they remain as integers with the condition that `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`; printed output is '+'**
