The code executes a print statement, which outputs the string `?`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the function prints `?`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the function prints `?`**
