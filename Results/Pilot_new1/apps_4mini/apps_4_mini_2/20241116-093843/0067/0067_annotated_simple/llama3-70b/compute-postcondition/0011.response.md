The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?` to the console. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `z` is not equal to 0, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (x â‰¤ y + z); printed output is '?'**
