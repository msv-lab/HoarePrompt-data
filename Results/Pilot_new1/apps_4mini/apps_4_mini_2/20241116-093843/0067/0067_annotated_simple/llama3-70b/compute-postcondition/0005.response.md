The `print('-')` statement outputs a string `'-'` to the console. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is less than `y`, and the output is `'-'`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, `x` is less than `y`, and the output is '-'**
