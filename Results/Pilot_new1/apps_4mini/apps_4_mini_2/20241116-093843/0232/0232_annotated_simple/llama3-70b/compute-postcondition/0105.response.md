Postcondition: ***`found` is False initially. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, `i` is unchanged, `j` is still `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1.***
