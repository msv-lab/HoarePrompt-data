The code `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. If `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, it was added with a value of 0 before this operation, so now it will be 1. If `color` was already a key, its value will increase by 1. The states of the other variables (`found`, `i`, `j`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `window_counts[color]`.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
