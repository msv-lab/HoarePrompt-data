Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited without modifying `i`, `j`, or `window_counts`. If `found` is False, `i` remains n-1, `j` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` stays empty, indicating that the desired condition was not met and the loop did not execute. This encompasses scenarios where `colors` is empty or the range is invalid, which also results in `found` remaining False.***
