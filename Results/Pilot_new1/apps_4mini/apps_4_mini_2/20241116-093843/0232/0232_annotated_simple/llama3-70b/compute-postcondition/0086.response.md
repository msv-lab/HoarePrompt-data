According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, if `found` is True, the loop has exited and `i`, `j`, and `window_counts` remain unchanged. If `found` is False, `i` remains n-1, which means it is not less than `n`, and the loop cannot execute again. 

In this case, since `i` is n-1 and `found` is False, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to n-1 (the maximum value for `i` in the range) and `n` must be greater than n-1, which is just n. However, since `found` is still False, it indicates that the desired condition was not met, which suggests that `n` must be greater than n-1 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than n-1.

State: **`found` is False, `i` is n-1, `j` is unchanged, `window_counts` stays empty, `n` is greater than n-1**
