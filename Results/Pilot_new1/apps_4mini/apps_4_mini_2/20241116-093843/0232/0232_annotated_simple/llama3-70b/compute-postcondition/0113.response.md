Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, while `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. Additionally, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 before the condition is checked. If the condition is not satisfied, `found` remains False and no changes occur to `i`, `j`, or `window_counts`.***
