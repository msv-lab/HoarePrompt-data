Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is n-2, `j` is n-1, and `n` is greater than n-1. If `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]` and does not exist in `window_counts`, it will be added with a value of 0. If `color` already exists in `window_counts`, its previous value remains unchanged.***
