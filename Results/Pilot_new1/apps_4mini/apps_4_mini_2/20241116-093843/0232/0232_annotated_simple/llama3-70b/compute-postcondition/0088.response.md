According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`, which is guaranteed since `n` is stated to be greater than `n-1`. 

At the start of the loop, `j` will take on the value of `i`, which is `n-1`. Therefore, the first value of `j` will be `n-1`. Since `n` is greater than `n-1`, the loop will execute at least once.

However, `found` being False and `window_counts` being an empty dictionary does not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the state.

Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute are already satisfied. 

State: **`found` is False, `i` is n-1, `j` is n-1, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than n-1**
