The values of `n` and `m` are assigned by taking input and converting it into integers. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n). Since the input is taken from the user, the specific values of `n` and `m` will depend on that input. Other variables, `colors` and `counts`, are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `m` are now set to the values obtained from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n)**
