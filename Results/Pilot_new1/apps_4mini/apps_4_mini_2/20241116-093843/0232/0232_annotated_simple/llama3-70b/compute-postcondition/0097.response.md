Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is False initially. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` after being sorted, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the state of `i`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
