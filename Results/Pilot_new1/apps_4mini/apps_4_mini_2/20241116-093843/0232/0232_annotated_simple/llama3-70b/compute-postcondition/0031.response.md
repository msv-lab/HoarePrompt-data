Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is updated to its previous value + 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the state of `window_counts` reflects the incremented count for `color`.***
