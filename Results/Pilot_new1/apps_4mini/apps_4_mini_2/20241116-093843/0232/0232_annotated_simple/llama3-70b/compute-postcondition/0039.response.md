Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the program continues without any changes to `found`.***
