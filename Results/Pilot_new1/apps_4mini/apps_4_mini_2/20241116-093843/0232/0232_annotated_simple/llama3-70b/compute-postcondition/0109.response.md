Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
