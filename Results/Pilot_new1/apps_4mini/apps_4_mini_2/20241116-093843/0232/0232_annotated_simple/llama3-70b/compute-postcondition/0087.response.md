The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. The other variables `found`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `i` is n-1, `j` is unchanged, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, and `n` is greater than n-1.

Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is n-1, `j` is unchanged, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `n` is greater than n-1**
