According to the code, the loop will execute for each value of `right` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is 1 or greater.

Before the loop starts, the state includes:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, which ensures that the loop can execute.
- `right` is not yet defined but will start at 0 when the loop begins.

Since the loop will iterate from `right = 0` to `right = n-1`, we need to ensure that `right` is initialized correctly at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0**
