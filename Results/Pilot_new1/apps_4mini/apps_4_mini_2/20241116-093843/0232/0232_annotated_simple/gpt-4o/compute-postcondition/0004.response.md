The code increments the count of the color at the index `right` in the `current_counts` array. The value of `right` is 0, so it accesses the first element of the `colors` list. The previous values of `current_counts` are not specified, but the operation will increase the count for the specific color indexed by `colors[0]` by 1. The value of `n` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[0]]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[0]]` is incremented by 1**
