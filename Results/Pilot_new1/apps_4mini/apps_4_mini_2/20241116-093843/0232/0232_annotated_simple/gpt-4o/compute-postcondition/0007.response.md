Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[0]]` is incremented by 1. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding counts in `current_counts` equal to the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. If any color does not meet the desired count, the function does not return 'YES'.***
