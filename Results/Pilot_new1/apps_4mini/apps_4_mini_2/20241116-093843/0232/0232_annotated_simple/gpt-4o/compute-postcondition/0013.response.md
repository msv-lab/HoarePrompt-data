Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and at least one `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`. If all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for every color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no return value from the function.***
