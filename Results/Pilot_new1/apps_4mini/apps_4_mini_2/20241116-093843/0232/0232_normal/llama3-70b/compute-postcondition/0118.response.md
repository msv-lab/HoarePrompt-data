Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop is exited, indicating that the counts in `window_counts` match the desired values in `counts`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining an empty dictionary, `found` as False, and `i` unchanged.***
