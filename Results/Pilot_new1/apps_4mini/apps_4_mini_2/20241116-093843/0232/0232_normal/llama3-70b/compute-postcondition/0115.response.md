Output State: **`window_counts` contains the counts of colors found in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`, `found` is True if the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating the desired counts have been achieved; if the loop does not execute (when `i` is greater than or equal to `n`), `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` is False, and `i` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to `1`, the loop will not execute, and `window_counts` will remain empty with `found` as False.**
