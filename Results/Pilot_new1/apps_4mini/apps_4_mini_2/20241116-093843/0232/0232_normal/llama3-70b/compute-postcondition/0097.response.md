Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged; `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` for all pairs (count, target), indicating that the desired counts have been achieved; if the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, while `i` is still 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, with `window_counts[color]` having been increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False and no changes occur to the other variables.***
