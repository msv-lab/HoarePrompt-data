Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is still 0, with `window_counts[color]` either being 1 or incremented by 1.***
