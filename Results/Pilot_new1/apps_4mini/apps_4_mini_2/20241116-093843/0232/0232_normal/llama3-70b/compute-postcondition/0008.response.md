The variable `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not previously a key in `color_counts`, it has been added with a value of 0 before this operation, so the new value becomes 1. If `color` was already a key, its value is simply increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `color_counts[color]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element in `colors`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `color_counts` is updated with `color_counts[color]` incremented by 1.**
