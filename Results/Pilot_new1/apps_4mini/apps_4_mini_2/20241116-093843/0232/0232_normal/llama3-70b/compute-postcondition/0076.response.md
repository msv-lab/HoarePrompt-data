Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0, while `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `color` is `colors[3]`. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, the value of `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
