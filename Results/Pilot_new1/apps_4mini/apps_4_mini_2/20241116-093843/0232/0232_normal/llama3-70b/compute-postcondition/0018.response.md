Output State: **`color_counts` will contain the count of each unique color from the `colors` list. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `colors` contains at least 1 element, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, and `counts` remains a list of integers from input.**
