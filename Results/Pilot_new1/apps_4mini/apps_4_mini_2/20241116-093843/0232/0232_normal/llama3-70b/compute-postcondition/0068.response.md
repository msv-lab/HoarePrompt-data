Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain as 1, greater than 2, and 2 respectively, while `color` retains the value assigned from `colors[2]`.***
