Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in `colors`, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 (if `color` is not present, it becomes 1; if it is present, its previous value is increased by 1).**
