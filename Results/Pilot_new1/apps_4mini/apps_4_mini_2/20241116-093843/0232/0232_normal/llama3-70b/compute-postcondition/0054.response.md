The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary `{}`. This assignment changes the value of `window_counts` from its previous state (which was also an empty dictionary) to a new empty dictionary, but the content remains the same as it was before. Other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 0 and at most `n-1`.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is at least 0 and at most `n-1**
