The variable `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value `0`. Since `window_counts[color]` is being set to `0`, this indicates that the previous value of `window_counts[color]` (which was not specified) is overwritten. The other variables (`color_counts`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `color`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged; `window_counts[color]` is now 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 3; `color` is colors[3].

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged; `window_counts[color]` is now 0; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 3; `color` is colors[3]**
