Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` as 0, `n` greater than 0, and `j` at least 0 and at most `n-1`. If `found` is False, the execution continues, and the state of `found`, `window_counts`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remains unchanged, which means `found` is still False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is still 0, and `n` is greater than 0 with `j` at least 0 and at most `n-1`. Furthermore, if `n` is 0 or if `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, resulting in `found` remaining False, `window_counts` as an empty dictionary, and `i` still as 0.***
