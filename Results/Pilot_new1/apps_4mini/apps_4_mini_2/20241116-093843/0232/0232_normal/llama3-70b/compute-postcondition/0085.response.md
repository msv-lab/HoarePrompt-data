Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged; if `found` is True, the loop terminates early, leaving `window_counts` empty, `i` as 1, and `j` not initialized. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being empty, `found` as False, `i` as 1, and `j` not initialized.***
