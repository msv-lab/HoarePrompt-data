Postcondition: ***`color` is `colors[3]`, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `color_counts` remains unchanged. If the condition that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` is satisfied, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, the state of `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
