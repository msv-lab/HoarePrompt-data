Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the respective targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the state of `found` remains unchanged, and the loop continues without breaking.***
