The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary. The other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `j` is not initialized.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is not initialized**
