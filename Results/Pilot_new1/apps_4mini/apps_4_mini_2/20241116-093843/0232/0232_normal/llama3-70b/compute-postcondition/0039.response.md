Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, the loop is exited; otherwise, the program continues executing without changing the state of `found`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.***
