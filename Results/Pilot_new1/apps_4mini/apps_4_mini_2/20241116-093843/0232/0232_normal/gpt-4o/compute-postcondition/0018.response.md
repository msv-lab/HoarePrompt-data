According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `right` needs to be equal to `n`, and since `left` is not directly affected by the loop's execution condition, it remains unchanged.

State: **`current_counts` is updated for the color at index `right`, `left` is 0, `right` is n**
