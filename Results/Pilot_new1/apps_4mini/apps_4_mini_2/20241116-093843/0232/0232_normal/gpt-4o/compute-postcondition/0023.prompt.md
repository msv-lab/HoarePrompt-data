You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), colors is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and k is a list of m integers where the sum of the integers in k is at least 1 and at most n.
```
def func_1(n, m, colors, k):
```
Output: Case_1: After the loop executes, if there exists a contiguous subarray of `colors` such that the counts of each color in that subarray match the `desired_counts`, the function will return 'YES'. If no such subarray exists, the loop will terminate with `left` being at least 0 and at most `n`, `right` will be `n`, and `current_counts` will reflect the counts of the colors in the entire `colors` list. If `current_counts` does not satisfy the loop condition at the start, the loop will not execute, leaving `left` at 0 and `current_counts` unchanged. If `desired_counts` is not achievable with the given `colors`, the loop will also end without returning 'YES'.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
