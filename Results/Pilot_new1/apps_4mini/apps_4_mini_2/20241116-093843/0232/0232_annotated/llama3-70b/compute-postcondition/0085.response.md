Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the loop breaks, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, and `i` remains 1 while `j` has taken values from 1 to n-1. If `n` is equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains unchanged. If `window_counts` is empty and the loop executes, it will contain the counts of colors from index 1 to n-1. If no colors match the required counts after all iterations, `found` remains False.***
