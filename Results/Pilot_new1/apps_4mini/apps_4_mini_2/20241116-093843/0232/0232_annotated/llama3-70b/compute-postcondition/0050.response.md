Postcondition: ***`found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` for at least one `j` in the range from `i` to `n - 1`. If `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors encountered up to `j`. If `n` is 0, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `j` is not defined, and `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary.***
