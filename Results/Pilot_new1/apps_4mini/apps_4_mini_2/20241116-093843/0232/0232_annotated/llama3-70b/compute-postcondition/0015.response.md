Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `color` is the third integer in the `colors` list. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, no changes are made to `color_counts`.***
