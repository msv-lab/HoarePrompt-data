The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `color` is the third element of `colors`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
