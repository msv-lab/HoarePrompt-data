The variable `colors` is assigned a new value which is a list of integers. This list is created by taking input as a string, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and then creating a list from these integers. The previous value of `colors` is not specified, but it will be overwritten. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, and `colors` is a list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `colors` is a list of integers from the input**
