Output State: **`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the loop executes, `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` takes on values from 1 to n-1. If all counts match the targets at any point during the loop execution, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `n` is equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains unchanged. If `window_counts` is empty and the loop executes, `window_counts` will contain the counts of colors from index 1 to n-1. If no colors match the required counts after all iterations, `found` remains False.**
