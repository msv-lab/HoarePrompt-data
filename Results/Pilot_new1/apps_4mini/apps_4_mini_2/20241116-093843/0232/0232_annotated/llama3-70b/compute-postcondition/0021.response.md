The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of the affected variables indicate that `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. Since the initialization of `window_counts` does not affect any of the other variables, the output state reflects that only `window_counts` has been initialized.

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
