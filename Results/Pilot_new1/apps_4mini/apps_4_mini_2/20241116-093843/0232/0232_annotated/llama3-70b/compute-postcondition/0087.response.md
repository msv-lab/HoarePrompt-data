The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. This assignment does not affect the values of `found`, `i`, or `n`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `found` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`found` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
