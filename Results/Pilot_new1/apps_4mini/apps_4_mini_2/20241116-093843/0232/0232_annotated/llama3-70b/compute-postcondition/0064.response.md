Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating whether all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If all counts match the targets, `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop, while `i` remains 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is 1. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged, but the state of the program continues to allow for further evaluation of the conditions in subsequent iterations.***
