The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` takes values from 2 up to `n-1`, and `window_counts` contains counts of colors from the `colors` list starting at index `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
