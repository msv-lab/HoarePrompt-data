Postcondition: ***`found` remains unchanged unless the condition `all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts))` is true, in which case `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain as 2, greater than or equal to 3, and 3 respectively, while `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged and the program continues executing.***
