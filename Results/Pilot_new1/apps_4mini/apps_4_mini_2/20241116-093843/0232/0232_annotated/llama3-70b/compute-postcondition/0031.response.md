Postcondition: ***`color` is the first element of `colors`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1 if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, but `window_counts[color]` is still incremented by 1.***
