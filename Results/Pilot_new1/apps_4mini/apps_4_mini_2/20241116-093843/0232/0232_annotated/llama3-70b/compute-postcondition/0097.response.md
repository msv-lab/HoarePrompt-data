Postcondition: ***`found` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is 2, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged and the loop continues.***
