The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `right` is currently holding a value that represents an index of the `colors` list, which is within the bounds of the list. The previous state of `current_counts` is not specified, but it is a defaultdict initialized to 0 for any key. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `current_counts` based on the color at the `right` index.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated with the count of `colors[right]` incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0**
