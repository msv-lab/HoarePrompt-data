Postcondition: ***`current_counts` is updated with the count of `colors[right]` incremented by 1, and both `left` and `right` are 0. If the counts of all colors in `current_counts` match the corresponding desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
