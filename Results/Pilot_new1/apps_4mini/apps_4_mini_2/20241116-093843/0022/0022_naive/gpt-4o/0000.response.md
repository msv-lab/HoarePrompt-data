To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description
A string is defined as an "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle of the string. For example:
- "oHo" is an s-palindrome.
- "aa" is not an s-palindrome because the second half is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

### Program Analysis
The provided program defines a function `func_1(s)` that checks if the string is symmetric:
```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True
```
The function compares characters from the start of the string to the corresponding characters from the end, moving towards the center. If any pair of characters does not match, it returns `False`. If all pairs match, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Single Character Strings**: Strings of length 1 (e.g., "a") should be considered s-palindromes since they have no pairs to compare.
2. **Even Length Strings**: Strings of even length (e.g., "abba") should be checked correctly.
3. **Odd Length Strings**: Strings of odd length (e.g., "aba") should also be checked correctly.
4. **Case Sensitivity**: The program does not account for case sensitivity, which may lead to incorrect results. For example, "aA" would be considered not symmetric, but if we treat it case-insensitively, it is symmetric.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle case sensitivity, which means it will incorrectly identify strings like "aA" as not being s-palindromes when they should be considered symmetric.

### Example of Failure
- Input: "aA"
- Expected Output: "TAK" (it is an s-palindrome)
- Actual Output: "NIE" (the program will return false due to case mismatch)

Given this analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
