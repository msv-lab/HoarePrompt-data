Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters are equal, no action is taken, and the program continues executing beyond this point.***
