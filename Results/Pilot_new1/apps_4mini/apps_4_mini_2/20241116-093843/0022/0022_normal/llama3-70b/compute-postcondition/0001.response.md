The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which calculates the length of the string `s` input by the user. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input from the user, `n` is the length of that string.

Output State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is the length of that string**
