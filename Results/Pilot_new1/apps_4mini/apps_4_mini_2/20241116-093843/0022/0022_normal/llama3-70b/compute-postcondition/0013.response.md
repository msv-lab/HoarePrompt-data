The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect any of the previous variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
