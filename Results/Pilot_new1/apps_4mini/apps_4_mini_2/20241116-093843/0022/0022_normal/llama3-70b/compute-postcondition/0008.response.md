According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. Thus, `n // 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Since the loop's condition is still satisfied (1 is less than n // 2 when n is at least 2), the states need to be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is initially True, `i` is 1**
