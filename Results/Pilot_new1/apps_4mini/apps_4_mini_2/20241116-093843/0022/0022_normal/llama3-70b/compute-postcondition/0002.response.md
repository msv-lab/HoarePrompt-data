The variable `is_palindrome` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`, which remain as the user input string and its length, respectively. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input from the user, `n` is the length of that string, and `is_palindrome` is set to True.

Output State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is the length of that string, and `is_palindrome` is set to True**
