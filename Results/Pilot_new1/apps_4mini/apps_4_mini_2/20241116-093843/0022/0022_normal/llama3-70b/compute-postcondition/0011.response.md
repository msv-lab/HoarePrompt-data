Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is initially True, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the loop is exited. If the characters do match, `is_palindrome` remains True, and the loop continues for further checks.***
