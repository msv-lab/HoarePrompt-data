The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, while `is_spalindrome` is now False.
