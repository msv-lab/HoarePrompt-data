Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input from the user, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is initially True, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If the characters are equal, the program continues without changing the value of `is_spalindrome`.***
