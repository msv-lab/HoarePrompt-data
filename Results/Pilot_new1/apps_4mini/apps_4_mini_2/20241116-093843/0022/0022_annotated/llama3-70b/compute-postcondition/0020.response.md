Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and checks if the user input string is a palindrome. It prints 'TAK' if the string is a palindrome and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-English letters, and it does not validate the length of the input string, which could lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid input is provided. **
