The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `is_palindrome` is `True`, but it is not affected by this assignment. The other variables `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
