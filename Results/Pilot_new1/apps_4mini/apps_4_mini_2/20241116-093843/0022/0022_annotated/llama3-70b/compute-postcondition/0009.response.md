The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are `is_palindrome` is `True`, and `is_spalindrome` is now `False`. The other variables, `s`, `n`, and `i`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
