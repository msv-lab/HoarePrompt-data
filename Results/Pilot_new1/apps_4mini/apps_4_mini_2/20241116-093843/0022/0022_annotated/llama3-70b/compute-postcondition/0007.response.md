Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least 2 characters, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, and the check continues for the next characters.***
