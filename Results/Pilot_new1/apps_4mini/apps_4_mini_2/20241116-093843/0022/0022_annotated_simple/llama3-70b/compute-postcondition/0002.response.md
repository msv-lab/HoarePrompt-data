The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables, `s` and `n`, remain unchanged, as this assignment does not impact them. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a new input string, `n` is the length of that input string, and `is_spalindrome` is True.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string, `n` is the length of that input string, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
