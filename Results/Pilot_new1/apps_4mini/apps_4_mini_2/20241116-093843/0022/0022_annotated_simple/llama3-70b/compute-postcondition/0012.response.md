According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, but we know that `n` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value, which would be `i + 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n // 2` after the adjustment, which means `i` must be less than `1` before the next iteration. 

Thus, we can conclude that `i` should be set to `1` for the loop to execute one more time, and `is_spalindrome` remains True as long as the characters at the specified indices are equal.

State: **`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 1**
