The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition of `s[i - 1]`. Given that `prefix_balances` is a list filled with zeros and `i` is 2, the new value of `prefix_balances[i]` will depend on the character at `s[1]`. 

If `s[1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `prefix_balances[1] + 1`, which is `0 + 1`, resulting in `1`. Conversely, if `s[1]` is not '0' (i.e., it is '1'), then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `prefix_balances[1] - 1`, which is `0 - 1`, resulting in `-1`. 

Thus, `prefix_balances[i]` will be either `1` or `-1` based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1**
