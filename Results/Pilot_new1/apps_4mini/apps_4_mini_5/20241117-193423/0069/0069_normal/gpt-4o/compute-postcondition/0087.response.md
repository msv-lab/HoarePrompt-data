The code assigns a value to `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. Since `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is initially 0. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` evaluates to either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not.

Thus, if `s[i - 1]` is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `0 + 1 = 1`. If `s[i - 1]` is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `0 - 1 = -1`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` will be either 1 or -1 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1**
