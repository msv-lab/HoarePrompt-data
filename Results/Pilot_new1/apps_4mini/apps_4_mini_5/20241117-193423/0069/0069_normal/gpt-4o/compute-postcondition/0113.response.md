Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0. If `prefix_balances` is empty or does not contain valid elements, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. Additionally, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a non-zero integer.**
