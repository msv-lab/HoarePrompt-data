Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated by appending 0. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged regardless of the outcome of the condition.***
