Output State: **After executing the loop T times, `results` contains the outcomes based on the analysis of each test case. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; if `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found, `results` includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and `balance` is 0, leading to results being either -1 or 0 depending on `x`. There are cases where if `T` is 0, the loop does not execute at all, and `results` remains an empty list.**
