Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` has -1 appended to it; otherwise, `results` has 0 appended to it. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` has `count` appended to it. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and `balance` is 0.***
