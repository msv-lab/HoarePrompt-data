Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s` such that `prefix_balances[i]` is the sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' in the first `i` characters of `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` at each index. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros.**
