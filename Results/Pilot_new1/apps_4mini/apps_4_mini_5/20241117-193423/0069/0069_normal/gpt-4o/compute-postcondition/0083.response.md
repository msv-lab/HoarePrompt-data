The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`prefix_balances`, `results`, `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `index`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `results` includes the outcomes of previous iterations, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.**
