The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and a conditional expression that checks the value of `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `n + 1`, we look at `prefix_balances[n + 1]`. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` will evaluate to either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `s[n]` is `'0'` or not. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and the value of `s[n - 1]`, where `i` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[n]` and the value of `s[n - 1]`, where `i` is `n + 1`**
