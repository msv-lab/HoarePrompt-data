The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at position `i - 1` in the string `s`. The value of `s[i - 1]` is either '0' or '1'. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', it adds 1 to `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, otherwise, it subtracts 1. The previous values of `prefix_balances` and `s` are essential to determine the new value of `prefix_balances[i]`.

Assuming `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is known and `s[i - 1]` is either '0' or '1', we can determine the new value for `prefix_balances[i]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`**.
