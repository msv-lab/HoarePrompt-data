Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0; `count` remains unchanged if `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. `x` is an integer, `balance` is a non-zero integer, and `b` is the new last element in the adjusted `prefix_balances`.***
