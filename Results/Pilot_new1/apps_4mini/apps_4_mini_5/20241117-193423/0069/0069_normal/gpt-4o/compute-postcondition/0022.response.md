Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to each index in `s` results in a total balance of 0; `x` is an element that exists within `prefix_balances`; if `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, and `balance` is 0; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and `balance` is 0; `results` now has an element -1 appended to it.**
