Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `1 <= i <= n`) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to that index. The balance is equal to 0, indicating that the number of '0's in the string `s` is equal to the number of '1's. The value `x` is one of the elements in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is at least 1, the list has been updated accordingly; if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros.***
