The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `balance` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has -1 appended to it, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 filled with zeros, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
