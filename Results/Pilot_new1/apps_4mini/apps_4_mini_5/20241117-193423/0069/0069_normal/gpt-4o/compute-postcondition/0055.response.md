According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`prefix_balances[2]` is either 3, 1, or -1 based on the values of `prefix_balances[1]` and `s[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3**
