The value of `index` is incremented by 3, resulting in a new value for `index`. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables (`T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `results`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `index` is 4, and `results` is an empty list**
