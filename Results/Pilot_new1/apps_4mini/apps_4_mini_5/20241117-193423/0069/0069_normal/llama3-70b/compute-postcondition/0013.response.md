Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, which is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of adjustments needed to reach the balance with respect to `x`. This covers the cases where the divisibility condition holds and where it does not, ensuring all edge cases regarding the values of `x`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` are addressed.***
