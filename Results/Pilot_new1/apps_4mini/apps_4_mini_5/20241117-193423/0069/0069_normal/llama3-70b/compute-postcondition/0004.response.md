The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the values of the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, respectively. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, while `n` and `x` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
