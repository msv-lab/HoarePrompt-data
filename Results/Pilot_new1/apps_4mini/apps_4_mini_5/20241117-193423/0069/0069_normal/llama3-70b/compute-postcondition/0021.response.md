The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1`, but it does not modify the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same with respect to the variables. The values of `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.**
