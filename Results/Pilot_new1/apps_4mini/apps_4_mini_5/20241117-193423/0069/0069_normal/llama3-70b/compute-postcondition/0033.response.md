Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero when calculating the division. Edge cases include when `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, resulting in a division by zero, and when `x` equals `balance`, which would also yield -1.***
