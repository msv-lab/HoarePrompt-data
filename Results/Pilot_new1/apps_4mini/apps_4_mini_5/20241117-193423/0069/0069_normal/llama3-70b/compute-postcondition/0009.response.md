Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. Additionally, `balance` is not equal to `x`.***
