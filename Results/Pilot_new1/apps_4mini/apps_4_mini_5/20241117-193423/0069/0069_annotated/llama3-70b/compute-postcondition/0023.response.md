Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `x - balance` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the integer result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for the case when `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a potential division by zero if `cnt0 - cnt1` is zero. In this case, the function should not be executed as it would not provide a valid output.***
