The expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is evaluated. Given that `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` are defined as per the initial state, the calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Calculate `x - balance`, which is a positive integer since `balance` is not equal to `x`.
2. Calculate `cnt0 - cnt1`, which is a non-zero integer since the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0` holds true, implying that `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`.
3. Perform integer division of the result from step 1 by the result from step 2.
4. Add 1 to the result of the integer division.

Since the specific values of `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` are not provided, the output state reflects the execution of the print statement without specifying exact numerical results.

Output State: **The expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is evaluated, and the result is printed.**
