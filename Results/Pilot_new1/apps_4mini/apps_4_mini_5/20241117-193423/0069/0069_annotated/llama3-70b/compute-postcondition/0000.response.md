Output State: **`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
