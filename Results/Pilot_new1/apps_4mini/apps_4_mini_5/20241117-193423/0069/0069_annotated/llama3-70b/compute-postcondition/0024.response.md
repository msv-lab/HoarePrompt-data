Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `x - balance` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1` and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, it prints -1. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the function does not execute the division to avoid division by zero, and thus does not produce a valid output. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, accounting for the necessary adjustments based on the balance and counts of '0's and '1's in the string.***
