According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and `n` must be at least 4 to satisfy the condition of `i <= n`. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated, `prefix_balances` is updated at index 1, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `prefix_balances[4]` is updated based on the value of `s[2]`.**
