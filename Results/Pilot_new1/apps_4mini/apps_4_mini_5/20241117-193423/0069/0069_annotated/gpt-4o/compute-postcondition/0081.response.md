The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, which means `x` will hold the integer value derived from the element at position `index + 1` in the `data` list. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `count`, `T`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment of `x` while retaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `count` is `n + 1`, `T` is greater than `n`, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, and `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])**
