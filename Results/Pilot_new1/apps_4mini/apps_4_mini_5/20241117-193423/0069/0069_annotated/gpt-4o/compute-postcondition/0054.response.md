The line of code updates `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at `s[i - 1]`. The previous value of `i` is 3, so `i - 1` is 2. The value of `prefix_balances[2]` was already updated based on `s[1]`. 

The calculation will be:
- If `s[i - 1]` (which is `s[2]`) is '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `prefix_balances[2] + 1`.
- If `s[i - 1]` (which is `s[2]`) is not '0', then `prefix_balances[i]` will be `prefix_balances[2] - 1`.

Since `prefix_balances[2]` was updated based on the value of `s[1]`, the output state will reflect the new value of `prefix_balances[i]`.

Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated, `prefix_balances` is updated at index 1, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the value of `s[2]`.**
