Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i` in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` based on the values in `s`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`.**
