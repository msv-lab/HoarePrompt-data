Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where if `balance` is 0, then if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1; otherwise, it includes 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of indices `i` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - prefix_balances[i])` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times to update `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`, and `count` remains 0 if `prefix_balances` is empty. Additionally, if `balance` is 0, the loop handles the division by zero error appropriately, ensuring `results` includes `count` without any errors.***
