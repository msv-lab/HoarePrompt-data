Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and the balance is equal to 0, indicating that the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to the current index is balanced. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times to update `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `1`.***
