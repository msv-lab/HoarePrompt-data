According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `n` is not specified, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute again. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2 or 0; `prefix_balances[3]` is either 3, 1, or -1; `i` is 2**
