Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in string `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains an additional element, 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated based on how many times `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` holds true for elements in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include this count. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and the behavior of `results` is determined accordingly based on the presence of `x` and the value of `balance`.***
