The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The values of `prefix_balances` remain unchanged as it is a list of integers with all elements being zeros, and the variable `balance` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where all elements are zeros; `balance` is not equal to 0; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, where all elements are zeros; `balance` is not equal to 0; `count` is 0**
