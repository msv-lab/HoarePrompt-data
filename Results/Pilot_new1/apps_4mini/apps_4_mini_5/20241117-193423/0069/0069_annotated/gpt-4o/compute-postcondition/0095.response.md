Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in string `s`. The variable `balance` is equal to 0. The value `x` is present in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
