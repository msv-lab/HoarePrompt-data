Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100); for each test case, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The state of the variables remains unchanged, and the input function reads data from standard input.**
