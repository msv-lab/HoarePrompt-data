Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of `prefix_balances[i-1]` and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', or -1 if `s[i-1]` is '1'. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
