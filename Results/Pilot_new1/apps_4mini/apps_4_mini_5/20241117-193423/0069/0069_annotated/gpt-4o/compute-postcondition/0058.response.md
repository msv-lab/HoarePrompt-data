Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and the balance is equal to 0. The value `x` is present in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times to update `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `1`.***
