Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where the balance is equal to 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes an additional value of 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times to update `prefix_balances`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `1`.***
