The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros, with a length of `n + 1`. The values of `s`, `index`, and `balance` are not affected by this initialization, as it only creates a new list. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `s`, `index`, and `balance`.

Output State: **`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`; `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**
