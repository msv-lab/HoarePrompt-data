Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i` in the string `s`, and `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` based on the values in `s`. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`.***
