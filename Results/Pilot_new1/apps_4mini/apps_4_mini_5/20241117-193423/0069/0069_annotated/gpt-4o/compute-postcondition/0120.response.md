According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If `results` is a non-empty list, the loop can execute at least once. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, and the loop has already processed one element from it. To execute the loop one more time, `results` must still contain at least one more element after the current iteration. 

Since the loop processes one element from `results` in each iteration, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `results` still contains elements. Therefore, we need to specify that `results` must contain at least 2 elements after the last iteration. The loop will now process the next element in the list.

State: **`results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `balance` is 0**
