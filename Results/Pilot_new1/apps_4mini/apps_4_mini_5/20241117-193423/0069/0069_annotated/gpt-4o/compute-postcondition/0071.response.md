Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 2, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `(x - b) % balance != 0` or `(x - b) // balance < 0`, then `count` remains 0.***
