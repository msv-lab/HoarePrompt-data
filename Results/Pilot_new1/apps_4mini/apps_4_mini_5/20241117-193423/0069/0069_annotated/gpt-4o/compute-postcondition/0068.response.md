Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 1, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is initialized to 0. If the difference `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is increased by 1. If `(x - b)` is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, `count` remains unchanged.***
