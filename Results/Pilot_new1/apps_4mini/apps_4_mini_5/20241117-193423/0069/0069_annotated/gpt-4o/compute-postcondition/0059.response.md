The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but we know that `results` is a list that will now contain an additional value. The state of `prefix_balances` and `balance` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, balance is equal to 0, and `results` now includes -1**
