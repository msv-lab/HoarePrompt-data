According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute at least once, `results` must contain at least one element. If `n` is 0 or less, `results` will not be populated, and the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0, and that `results` contains at least one entry.

Additionally, after the loop executes T times, `results` will contain values based on the conditions evaluated. Assuming `balance` has been calculated and the necessary conditions have been met, we can set the state of `results` to contain at least one valid entry.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is defined, and `x` is defined**
