Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `b` is the next element in the list after the current `b`. If the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
