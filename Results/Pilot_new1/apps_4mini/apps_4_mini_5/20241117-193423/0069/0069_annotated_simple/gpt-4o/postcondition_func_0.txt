The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, and based on this balance, it determines the output for each test case. If the balance is zero and `x` is found in the prefix sums of `s`, it appends -1 to the results; if not found, it appends 0. If the balance is non-zero, it counts how many prefix sums can yield a valid solution for the equation `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and appends this count to the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case. If `n` is 0 or less, the function handles it by initializing `prefix_balances` to zeros and may skip the inner loop, resulting in an empty or minimal output.
