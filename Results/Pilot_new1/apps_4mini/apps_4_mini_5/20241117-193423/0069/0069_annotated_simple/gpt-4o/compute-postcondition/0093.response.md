Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to index `i`; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`; for `i` from 2 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated as `prefix_balances[i - 1] + 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '0' or `prefix_balances[i - 1] - 1` if `s[i - 1]` is '1'; if `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, leaving `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros with length 1 (i.e., `[0]`).**
