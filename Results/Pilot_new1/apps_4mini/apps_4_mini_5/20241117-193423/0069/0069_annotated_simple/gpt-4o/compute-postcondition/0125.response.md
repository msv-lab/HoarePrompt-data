Output State: **`results` contains the output of each test case based on the conditions evaluated; if `n` is greater than 0, `results` is a list containing at least `n` elements, and `balance` and `x` are defined. If `n` is 0 or less, `results` is an empty list, and no iterations of the loop are executed. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1 for that test case; if not found, it contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of valid indices based on the conditions.**
