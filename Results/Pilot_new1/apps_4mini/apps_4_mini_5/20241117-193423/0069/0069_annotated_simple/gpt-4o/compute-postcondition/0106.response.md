According to the code, the loop iterates over each element in the `prefix_balances` list. The loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in the list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 0 and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`. Since `prefix_balances` has `n + 1` elements, the last value of `b` corresponds to `prefix_balances[n]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to take the next value in the `prefix_balances` list. Therefore, `b` should be updated to the next element in the list, which would be `prefix_balances[n + 1]`. However, since `prefix_balances` only has `n + 1` elements, there are no more elements left for `b` to take.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances` has at least `n + 2` elements. This means `n` must be adjusted to be at least `1` (if it was `0`, we would need at least one more element).

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is the next element in the list after the last iteration**
