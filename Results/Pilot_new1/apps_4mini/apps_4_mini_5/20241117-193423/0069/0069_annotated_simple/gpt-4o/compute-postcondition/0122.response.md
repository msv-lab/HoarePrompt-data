According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop will iterate over each element in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least two elements. For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must contain at least three elements, and the `result` variable must refer to the third element in the list. Additionally, the index of the current iteration must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`results` is a list containing at least three elements, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is defined, `x` is defined, and the function prints `results`.**
