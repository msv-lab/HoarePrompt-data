The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer that represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that \(1 \leq T \leq 100\).
- `n` is a positive integer that indicates the length of the binary string `s`, adhering to \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `x` is an integer that can range from \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting solely of the characters '0' and '1'.

The output of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return values without additional context. Therefore, we can only summarize the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (positive integer), n (positive integer), x (integer), and s (binary string of length n).**
