The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `T` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1.
