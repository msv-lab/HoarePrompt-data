The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1`, but it does not change the state of any variables. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1**.
