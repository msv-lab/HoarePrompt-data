Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero and that the calculation is valid.***
