Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, with `balance` not equal to `x`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the division is valid and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to avoid division by zero.***
