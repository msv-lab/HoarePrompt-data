The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string and `map(int, ...)` converts those values to integers. The previous state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is an integer, but their specific values are not known. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `x` have been updated based on the input values. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
