Output State: **If `T` is greater than 0, for each iteration of the loop, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special handling is needed since `cnt0 - cnt1` would be 0, avoiding division by zero. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no values are computed or printed.**
