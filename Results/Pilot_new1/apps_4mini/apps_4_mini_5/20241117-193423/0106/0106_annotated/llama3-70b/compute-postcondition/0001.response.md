The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not directly affected by this operation, but `a` and `b` now hold the values from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers assigned from input; `a` and `b` are integers from input.**
