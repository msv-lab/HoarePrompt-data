Functionality: ** The function accepts four integers: three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two integers `a` and `b` representing apartment numbers. It calculates the minimum time required to move between the floors and blocks of apartments `a` and `b`. The total time is computed as the sum of the time to move between blocks and the time to move between floors, and it prints this total time. The function does not return any value and assumes valid input is provided. **
