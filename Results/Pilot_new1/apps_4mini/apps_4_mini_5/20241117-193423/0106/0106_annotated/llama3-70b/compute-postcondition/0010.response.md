The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the values of `b_floor` and `a_floor`. The expression `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10` computes the time in minutes it takes to move from `a_floor` to `b_floor`, where each floor takes 5 minutes to travel, and an additional 10 minutes is added to the total time.

Since `a_floor` is defined such that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, the expression `(b_floor - a_floor)` will be non-negative. Therefore, `min_floor_time` will always yield a non-negative result.

The output state includes the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor`, along with the calculated `min_floor_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a` is an integer; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is defined such that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor; min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10**
