To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we first analyze the variables involved.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\).
   - `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\).
   - The variable `apartment` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot directly calculate the value of `block`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code calculates `block` using the formula:
     \[
     \text{block} = \frac{(\text{apartment} - 1)}{(m \cdot k)} + 1
     \]
   - Since the value of `apartment` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `block`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The value of `block` depends on the value of `apartment`, which is unknown. Therefore, we cannot specify the exact values of `block`, but we can state that the calculation is made based on the formula provided.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1 based on the value of `apartment`.**
