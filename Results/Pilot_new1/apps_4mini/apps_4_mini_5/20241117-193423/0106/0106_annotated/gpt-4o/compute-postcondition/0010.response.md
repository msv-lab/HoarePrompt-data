To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the effect of the code snippet on the variables.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`
   - `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`
   - `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - `time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5`

3. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code computes `time_to_target_floor` based on the value of `floor_b`. 
   - The calculation does not affect the values of `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, or `min_walk_time`.
   - The result of the calculation assigns a new value to `time_to_target_floor`, which is dependent on the current value of `floor_b`.

Since we do not have specific values for `floor_b`, we can only describe the relationship:

- `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The values of `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` remain unchanged.
   - The new variable `time_to_target_floor` is introduced.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is (floor_b - 1) * 5**
