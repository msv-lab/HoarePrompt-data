To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of blocks (entrances), floors per block, apartments per floor, and the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha, respectively.

2. **get_location Function**: This nested function calculates the entrance (block) and floor of a given apartment number. The formulas used seem correct:
   - `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: This determines which block the apartment is in.
   - `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`: This finds the position of the apartment within its block.
   - `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`: This calculates the actual floor number.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The time to exit from Edward's apartment to the ground floor is calculated based on whether he is already on the first floor or needs to take the elevator.
   - The walking time between blocks is calculated considering both direct and reverse paths.
   - Finally, the time to reach Natasha's floor is computed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not account for the case where Edward is already on the same floor as Natasha. In this case, he does not need to go to the ground floor first, and he can directly walk to Natashaâ€™s block from his current block, which might be a more optimal path.
   - The calculation of walking time between blocks does not consider the scenario where `block_a` and `block_b` are the same, which means the walking time should be zero in that case.

### Example Case for Failure:
Consider the input:
```
3 1 5
2 2
```
- Here, Edward lives in apartment 2 (block 1, floor 1), and Natasha also lives in apartment 2 (same block, same floor).
- The expected output should be `0` seconds, as Edward is already at Natasha's apartment.
- However, according to the program, it would calculate the time to exit (which would be `0` since he is already on the first floor), and then it would calculate `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, both of which would yield `0`, resulting in a total time of `0`, which is correct.

However, if we try:
```
3 1 5
1 2
```
- Edward lives in apartment 1 (block 1, floor 1), Natasha lives in apartment 2 (block 1, floor 1).
- The expected output should still be `0` seconds, but the program will calculate the time to exit (which is `0`) and the walking time (which will also be `0`), and the total time will be `0`, which is correct.

After considering these edge cases, I find that the program does handle both scenarios correctly, and no potential failure case arises.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the provided problem description, including all edge cases considered.
