Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. In both cases, the value of `min_floor_time` is adjusted based on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`, ensuring that it remains a positive integer as a result of the calculations.***
