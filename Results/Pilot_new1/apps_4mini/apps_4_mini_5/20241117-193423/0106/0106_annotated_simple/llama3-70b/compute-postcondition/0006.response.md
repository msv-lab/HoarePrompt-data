To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the calculations involved in the statement `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers based on the input values.
   - `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into two integers.
   - `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`.
   - `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
   - `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
   - `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

2. **Calculations**:
   - First, we compute `abs(a_block - b_block)`.
   - Then, we compute `n - abs(a_block - b_block)`.
   - We then take the minimum of these two values.
   - Finally, we multiply the result by `15` to obtain `min_block_time`.

3. **Output State**:
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_block`, and `b_block` are not explicitly given, but they are all positive integers derived from the input.
   - The final output state will reflect the calculated value of `min_block_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15**.
