Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the `block` and `floor` within that block based on the values of `m` and `k` (which are not defined within the function). It returns a tuple containing the `block` number and the `floor` number, where `floor` is determined by dividing the number of apartments within the block by `k` and adding 1. However, the function does not handle cases where `m` or `k` are zero, which could lead to division by zero errors.**
