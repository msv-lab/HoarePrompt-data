Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
