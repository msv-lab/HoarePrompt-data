To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
   - This function calculates the block ( подъезд ) and floor ( этаж ) for a given apartment number.
   - It uses integer division and modulus to derive the correct block and floor, which seems correct based on the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
   - It retrieves the block and floor for both Edward's and Natasha's apartments using `get_location`.
   - It calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment:
     - If he is already on the first floor, the exit time is 0.
     - If he is on a higher floor, the exit time is calculated as 10 seconds (waiting for the elevator) plus the number of floors he needs to travel down.
   - It calculates the walking time between blocks:
     - It considers both direct and reverse walking times around the circular building.
   - Finally, it computes the time taken to reach Natasha's floor and sums everything to get the total time.

### Potential Edge Cases

1. **Same Floor Scenario**:
   - If Edward and Natasha are on the same floor but in different blocks, the program should correctly calculate the walking time without any floor transition time.
   - Example: `n=3, m=1, k=5, a=2, b=3`. Here, Edward is at apartment 2 (block 1, floor 1) and Natasha is at apartment 3 (block 1, floor 1). The expected time should be 15 seconds for walking directly to the next block.

2. **Elevator Usage**:
   - If Edward is on a higher floor and the elevator is the faster option, the program must correctly account for the elevator wait time and travel time.
   - Example: `n=1, m=10, k=1, a=10, b=1`. Edward is on the 10th floor and Natasha is on the 1st floor. The expected time should be 10 seconds (wait) + 9 seconds (travel down) = 19 seconds.

3. **Circular Movement**:
   - The calculation of walking time must correctly handle the circular nature of the building.
   - Example: `n=4, m=1, k=1, a=1, b=4`. Edward is in apartment 1 (block 1) and Natasha is in apartment 4 (block 4). The expected time should be 15 seconds walking directly to block 4.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and considering edge cases, I found that the program does seem to handle the scenarios described in the problem statement correctly. It calculates the time based on the correct logic for both elevator and walking scenarios, including the circular nature of the building.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
