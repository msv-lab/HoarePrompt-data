Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are the values returned from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are the values returned from `get_location(b)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1, ensuring that `time_to_exit` is at least 10 for floors greater than 1.***
