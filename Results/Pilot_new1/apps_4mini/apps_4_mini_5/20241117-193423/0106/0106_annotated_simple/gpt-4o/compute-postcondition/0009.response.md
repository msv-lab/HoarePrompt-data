To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
2. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
3. The code `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)` assigns the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` to `min_walk_time`.

Given that both `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are already calculated based on the initial state, the output state will reflect the values of these variables and the result of the `min` function.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, and `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
