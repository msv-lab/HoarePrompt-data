To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)

1. The variable `floor_within_block` is already defined and holds a value based on the expression (apartment - 1) % (m * k).
2. The code then calculates `floor` as `floor_within_block // k + 1`.
3. The value of `floor` is determined by performing integer division of `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1 to the result.

Since `floor_within_block` is a derived value based on other variables, we cannot specify its exact value without knowing `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. However, we can express the relationship.

Output State: **`floor_within_block` is (apartment - 1) % (m * k); `floor` is `floor_within_block // k + 1`**
