To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, I will analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Overview
The problem describes a building with multiple entrances (blocks), floors, and apartments. Edward needs to find the minimum time to travel from his apartment to Natasha's apartment, considering various travel times for stairs, walking between blocks, and using the elevator.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the location of both apartments using the `get_location` function.
   - It calculates the time to exit the building based on Edward's current floor.
   - It computes the walking time between the blocks in both directions (direct and reverse).
   - The time to reach the target floor is calculated and added to the total time.

2. **Function `get_location`**:
   - It calculates the block and floor of the given apartment number based on the total number of floors and apartments per floor.

### Output Description
- The output hints suggest that the function calculates the total time required to reach from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, considering various travel times.

### Edge Cases
1. **Invalid Apartment Numbers**: The code does not handle cases where the apartment numbers are invalid or out of range. For example, if `a` or `b` is less than 1 or greater than `n * m * k`, the calculations could lead to incorrect block or floor values.
2. **Single Block**: If `n = 1`, the walking time calculation will still work, but it may not be explicitly tested in the code.
3. **Edge Cases with Floors**: If Edward is on the first floor (floor 1), the time to exit is set to 0. However, if he is on the top floor (floor `m`), the elevator calculation assumes he will always use it, which may not always be the best option depending on Natasha's location.

### Output Hints Agreement
The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where apartment numbers are invalid or out of range. This aligns with the code, as there are no checks for such cases. The hints also mention that the function assumes `m` and `k` are defined elsewhere, which is a potential issue.

### Conclusion
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to the lack of validation for apartment numbers and potential errors when `m` or `k` are not defined. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to account for invalid apartment numbers, which could lead to incorrect calculations of blocks and floors, and thus incorrect total time calculations.
