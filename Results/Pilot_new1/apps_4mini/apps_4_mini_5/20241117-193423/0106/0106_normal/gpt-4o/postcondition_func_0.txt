The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (with the range 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000) and two integers `a` and `b` representing apartment numbers. It calculates the total time required to reach from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, considering the time to exit the building, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is computed as the sum of the time to exit, the minimum walking time (either direct or reverse), and the time to reach the target floor. The function does not handle cases where the apartment numbers or blocks are invalid or out of range, which may lead to incorrect calculations or assumptions about the building layout.
