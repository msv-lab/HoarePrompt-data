To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables:

1. The code calculates the value of `block` using the formula:
   ```
   block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
   ```
2. The variable `apartment` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be one of the distinct integers `a` or `b` within the range of apartment numbers.
3. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. Therefore, `m * k` will also be a positive integer.

Since we do not have specific values for `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we can only describe the output state in terms of their relationships:

- The variable `block` will be computed based on the value of `apartment` (either `a` or `b`), and it will yield a positive integer result due to the integer division and addition involved.

Thus, the output state is described as follows:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers representing apartment numbers, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment` as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, resulting in a positive integer.**
