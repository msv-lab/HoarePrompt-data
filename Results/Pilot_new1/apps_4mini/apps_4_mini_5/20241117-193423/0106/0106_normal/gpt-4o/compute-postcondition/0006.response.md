Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer representing an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is greater than 1, then `time_to_exit` is `floor_a + 9`.***
