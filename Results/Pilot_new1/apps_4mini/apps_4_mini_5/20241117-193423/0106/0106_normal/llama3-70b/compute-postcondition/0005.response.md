To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we will analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state includes `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as positive integers from input.
2. We already have `a_floor` and `a_block` calculated using the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`.
3. The code snippet provided is:
   ```
   b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
   ```
4. This line calculates `b_block` using the value of `b`, `m`, and `k`.

Now, we will compute the value of `b_block`:
- `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which means we take `b - 1`, perform integer division by `m * k`, and then add 1.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `b_block` is newly computed.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the initial variables and includes the newly calculated value of `b_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from input; `a` is an input positive integer; `b` is an input positive integer; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
