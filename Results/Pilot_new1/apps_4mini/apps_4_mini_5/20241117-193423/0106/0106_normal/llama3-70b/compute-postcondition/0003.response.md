The variable `a_block` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers as per the initial state. 

The value of `a_block` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, but the calculation itself will yield a positive integer since both `m` and `k` are positive integers.

Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from input; `a` is an input positive integer; `b` is an input positive integer; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned positive integer values from input; `a` is an input positive integer; `b` is an input positive integer; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
