The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the result of `a_floor - b_floor` is a positive integer. Therefore, `min_floor_time` will be a positive integer as well. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers; `a`, `b` are positive integers; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `a_block`, `b_block` are calculated values; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
