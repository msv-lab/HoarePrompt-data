Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` have one less element each. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` has one more element with the value `r_index + n`, while `d_queue` remains unchanged. The values of `d_index`, `r_index`, and `n` remain unchanged throughout the execution.***
