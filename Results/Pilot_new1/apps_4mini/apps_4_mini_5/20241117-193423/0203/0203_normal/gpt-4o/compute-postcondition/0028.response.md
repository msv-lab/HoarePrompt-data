The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has at least one element, so the operation is valid. The value of `d_index` will be the first element of `d_queue`, and `d_queue` will be modified to remove that element. The state of `r_queue` and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged**.
