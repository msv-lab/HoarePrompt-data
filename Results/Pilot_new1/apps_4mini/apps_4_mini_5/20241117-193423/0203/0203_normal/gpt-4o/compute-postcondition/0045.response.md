Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, the function prints 'D', indicating that there are indices of 'D' characters that have won their contests, while `r_queue` may either be empty or contain indices of 'R' characters that have also won; if `d_queue` is empty, the function prints 'R', indicating that all 'D' characters have lost, and `r_queue` contains the remaining indices of 'R' characters, potentially with new indices added from the contests.***
