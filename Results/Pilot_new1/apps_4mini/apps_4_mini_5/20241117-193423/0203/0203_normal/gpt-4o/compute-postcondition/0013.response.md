Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character in the string `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the value 1. Otherwise, if `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` includes the value 1 while `d_queue` remains unchanged.***
