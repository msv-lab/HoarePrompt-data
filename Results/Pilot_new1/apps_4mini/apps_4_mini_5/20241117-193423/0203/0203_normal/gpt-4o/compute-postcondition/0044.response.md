The code prints the string 'R'. The values of `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables and the action taken.

Output State: **`d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` contains the remaining indices of 'R' characters, potentially with new indices added from the contests, and the output is 'R'**
