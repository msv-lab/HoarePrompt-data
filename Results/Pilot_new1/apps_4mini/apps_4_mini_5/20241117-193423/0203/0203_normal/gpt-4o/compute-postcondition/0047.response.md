Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes in a way that simulates contests between 'D' and 'R' characters based on their indices. After processing, it prints 'D' if any 'D' characters remain after all contests, or 'R' if all 'D' characters have lost. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
