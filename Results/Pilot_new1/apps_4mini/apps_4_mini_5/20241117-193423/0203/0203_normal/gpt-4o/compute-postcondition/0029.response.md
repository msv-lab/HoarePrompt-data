The code snippet `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The initial state indicates that `r_queue` remains unchanged, which implies that it still contains elements before the execution of the code. The value of `r_index` will be the first element of `r_queue` prior to the pop operation. After the operation, `r_queue` will have one less element. The values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `n` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` remains unchanged**.
