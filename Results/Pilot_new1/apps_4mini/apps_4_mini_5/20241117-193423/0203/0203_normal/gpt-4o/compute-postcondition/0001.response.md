The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take the user input and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state will indicate the new value of `votes`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `n` remains an input integer within 1 to 200,000.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
