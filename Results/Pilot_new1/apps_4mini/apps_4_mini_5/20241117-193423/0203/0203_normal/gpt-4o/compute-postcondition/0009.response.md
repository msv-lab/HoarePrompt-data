Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; if the first character `v` of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` is updated to [0] and `r_queue` remains empty; if `v` is 'R', then `r_queue` is updated to [0] and `d_queue` remains empty; in both cases, `i` is 0.***
