The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `r_queue` will now contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer within 1 to 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is now [0], `i` is 0, and `v` is 'R'.
