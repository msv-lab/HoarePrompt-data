The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The variable `i` has a value of 1, and `r_queue` remains unchanged before this operation. The state of `votes`, `n`, `v`, and `d_queue` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character in the string `votes`; `d_queue` remains unchanged; `r_queue` now includes the value 1.**
