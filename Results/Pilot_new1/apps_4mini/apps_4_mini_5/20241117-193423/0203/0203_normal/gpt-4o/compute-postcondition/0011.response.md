The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 1, and since `d_queue` remains unchanged before this operation, it will now include the value 1 at the end of the queue. The states of the other variables (`n`, `votes`, `v`, `r_queue`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character in the string `votes`; `d_queue` now includes the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within 1 to 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character in the string `votes`; `d_queue` now includes the value 1**
