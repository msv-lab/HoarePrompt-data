According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will iterate over each character in the `fractions` string, so it must not be empty for the loop to execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer, it implies that `fractions` should have a length of at least `n` characters (which should be between 1 and 200,000).

At the start of the loop, `fraction` will take the value of the first character in the `fractions` string. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `fractions` must contain at least one character.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
