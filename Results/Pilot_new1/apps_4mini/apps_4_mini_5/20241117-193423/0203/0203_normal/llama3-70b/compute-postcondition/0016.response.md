The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The values of `n` and `fractions` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 1 character remaining; `remocrats` is increased by 1.
