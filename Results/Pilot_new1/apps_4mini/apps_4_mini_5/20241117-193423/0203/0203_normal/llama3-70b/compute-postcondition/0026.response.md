Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` representing the number of characters, followed by a string `fractions` consisting of 'D' and 'R' characters. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if there are more 'D's than 'R's; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If the input string is empty, it defaults to printing 'R' as well. The function does not return any values. **
