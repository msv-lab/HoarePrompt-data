The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is 0, so after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and `fraction` is 'D'.
