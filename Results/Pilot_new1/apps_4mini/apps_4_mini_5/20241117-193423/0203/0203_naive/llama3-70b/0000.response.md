Correctness: **False**.

The provided program incorrectly assumes that the outcome of the vote can be determined simply by counting the number of employees from each fraction ('D' and 'R'). However, the problem description specifies that the voting process is more complex, involving the ability of employees to deny others the right to vote. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this scenario, the first employee (D) can deny the second employee (R) from voting. The third employee (D) can then deny the fourth employee (R), and so on. The program does not account for this dynamic process of denying votes, which can lead to different outcomes based on the order of actions taken by the employees.

Thus, the program fails to correctly predict the outcome of the vote based on the rules described, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
