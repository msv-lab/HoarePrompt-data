The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000**
