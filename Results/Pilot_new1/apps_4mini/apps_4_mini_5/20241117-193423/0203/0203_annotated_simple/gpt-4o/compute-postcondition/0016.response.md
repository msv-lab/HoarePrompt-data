The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, the value of `i` is also within this range. The state of the other variables, including `d_queue`, remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character indicating there are no more characters left to process; if `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the value of `i`; otherwise, `r_queue` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character indicating there are no more characters left to process; if `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the value of `i`; otherwise, `r_queue` includes the value of `i`, and `r_queue` has the value of `i` appended.**
