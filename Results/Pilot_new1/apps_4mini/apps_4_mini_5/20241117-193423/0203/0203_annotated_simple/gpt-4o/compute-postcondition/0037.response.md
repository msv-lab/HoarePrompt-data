The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, and `n` is an unspecified value. The operation modifies `r_queue` by adding a new element, which is the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and a new element `r_index + n` is appended to `r_queue`.**
