Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character indicating there are no more characters left to process. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes the value of `i` (which is `n`). Otherwise, `r_queue` includes the value of `i` (which is `n`).***
