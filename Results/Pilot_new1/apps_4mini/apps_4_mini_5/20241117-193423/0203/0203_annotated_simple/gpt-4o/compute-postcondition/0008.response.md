The `r_queue` list is modified by appending the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `i` to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is [0]; `i` is 0**
