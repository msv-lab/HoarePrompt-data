Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, indicating that there are 'D' characters in `votes`, the program prints 'D'. If `d_queue` is empty, which can occur if `votes` is an empty string or contains only 'R' characters, the program prints 'R', indicating that there are no 'D' characters present. In the case where both queues are non-empty, the output will still reflect the presence of 'D' characters in `d_queue` or default to 'R' if `d_queue` is empty.***
