According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the `votes` string to enumerate. The loop iterates over each character in the `votes` string, and `i` represents the index of the current character being processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` represents the index of the last character processed, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. This means that `i` should now be equal to the length of the `votes` string, which is `n`. The loop will not execute again if `i` is equal to `n`, as it would indicate that all characters have been processed.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `i` should be adjusted to `n` (the length of `votes`).
- The character `v` should be adjusted to indicate that there are no more characters left to process.

The queues (`d_queue` and `r_queue`) do not need to be adjusted since they are not directly related to the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to `n`, `v` is a character that indicates there are no more characters left to process.**
