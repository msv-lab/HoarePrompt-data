The `d_queue` has at least one element, and the operation `d_queue.pop(0)` removes and returns the first element of `d_queue`, assigning it to `d_index`. The state of `d_queue` will change as its first element is removed, while `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has at least one element**
