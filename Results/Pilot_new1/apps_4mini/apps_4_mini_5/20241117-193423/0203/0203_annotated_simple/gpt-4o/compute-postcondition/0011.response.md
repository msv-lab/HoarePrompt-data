The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000. The state of `d_queue` will change as it now contains the value of `i`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character that indicates there are no more characters left to process; `d_queue` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character that indicates there are no more characters left to process; `d_queue` now contains the value of `i`.**
