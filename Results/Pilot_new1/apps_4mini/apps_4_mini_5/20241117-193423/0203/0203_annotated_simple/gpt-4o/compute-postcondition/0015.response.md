The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character indicating there are no more characters left to process; `d_queue` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is equal to `n`; `votes` is a non-empty string; `v` is a character indicating there are no more characters left to process; `d_queue` now contains the value of `i`.**
