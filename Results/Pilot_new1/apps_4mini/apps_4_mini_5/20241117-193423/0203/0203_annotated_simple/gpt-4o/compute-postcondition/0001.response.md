The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will hold the input received from the user after removing any leading or trailing whitespace. The variable `n` remains unchanged in this operation. Since `votes` is now set to a string value based on user input, the output state reflects that change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string after stripping whitespace**
