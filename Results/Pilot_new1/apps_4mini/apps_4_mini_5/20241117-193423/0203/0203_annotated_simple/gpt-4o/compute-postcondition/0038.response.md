Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n` appended if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one more element with the value `r_index + n` appended. In both cases, `d_index` remains the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` has one less element prior to the operation.***
