The variable `remocrats` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an input integer), `fractions` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'), and `depublicans` (0). The initialization of `remocrats` does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
