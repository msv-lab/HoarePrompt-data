The function accepts an integer `n` (representing the length of the string) and a string `fractions` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if there are more 'D' characters than 'R' characters; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `n` is 0, the function does not process any characters, resulting in both counts being 0, and it will print 'R' in that case. The function does not return any value.
