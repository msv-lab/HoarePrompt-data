The code prints the character 'R'. The values of the variables `depublicans`, `remocrats`, and `fractions` are not modified by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation has occurred, while the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and if `n` is 0, then `depublicans` and `remocrats` are both 0; 'R' is printed.**
