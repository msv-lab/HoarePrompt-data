According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `fractions`. Since `n` is greater than 0, it indicates that `fractions` contains at least one character. The loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`, and the loop will continue as long as there are characters left to iterate.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, which means `fractions` still has remaining characters. To execute the loop one more time, `n` must be adjusted to reflect that there is one less character remaining in `fractions`. Thus, we need to set `n` to be greater than 0, and the next `fraction` will be the next character in the string.

To summarize:
- `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0, specifically `n` is greater than 1 (indicating that there is at least one character left).
- The `fraction` will be the next character in the string `fractions`, which will be the second character.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length greater than 1, `fraction` is the second character in the string**
