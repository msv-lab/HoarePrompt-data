The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length greater than 2, `fraction` is the third character in the string, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length greater than 2, `fraction` is the third character in the string, and `depublicans` is increased by 1**
