Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is either [0] if the first character of `votes`, `v`, is 'D' or an empty list if `v` is not 'D', and `r_queue` is either an empty list if `v` is 'D' or contains the value 0 if `v` is not 'D'. The variable `i` is 0, representing the index of the first character in `votes`.***
