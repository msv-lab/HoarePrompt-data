The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous value of `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is not specified but is considered to be a known value. The `d_queue` will have one more element after this operation. The states of `r_queue` and `r_index` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one more element; `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_queue` has one less element; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `d_queue` now includes the value `d_index + n`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element; `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_queue` has one less element; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`; `d_queue` now includes the value `d_index + n`.**
