The code executes a pop operation on `r_queue`, which removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The initial state indicates that `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` remains unchanged as the first element of the original `r_queue`. After the operation, `r_index` will now hold the value of the first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` will have one less element.

The output state reflects that `d_index` remains unchanged, `d_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` now holds the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is now the first element of the original `r_queue`**.
