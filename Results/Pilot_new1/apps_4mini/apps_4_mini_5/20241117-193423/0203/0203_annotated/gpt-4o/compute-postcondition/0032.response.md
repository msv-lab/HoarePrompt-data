Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element and includes the value `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one more element and includes the value `r_index + n`, while `d_queue` remains with one less element and `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`. In both cases, `d_index` is unchanged and represents the first element of the original `d_queue`, while `r_index` remains unchanged and represents the first element of the original `r_queue`.***
