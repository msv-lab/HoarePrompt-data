The code appends the value of `i` to `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1. Depending on the value of `v`, `r_queue` could be either an empty list or a list containing the value 0. However, since the operation only involves appending `i` to `r_queue`, the output state will reflect that change.

If `v` is 'D', `r_queue` starts as an empty list, and after appending `i`, it will contain [1]. If `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` starts with [0], and after appending `i`, it will contain [0, 1]. Therefore, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` is either [0] or an empty list; `r_queue` is either [1] or [0, 1]; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character in `votes`.**
