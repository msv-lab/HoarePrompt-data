Postcondition: ***`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n` appended to it. Otherwise, `r_queue` has one more element with the value `r_index + n` appended, while `d_queue` remains one element less. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` are unchanged throughout the operation.***
