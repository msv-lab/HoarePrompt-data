The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous values indicate that `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `n` is a value that has not been specified but is assumed to be a valid integer. The state of `r_queue` will change as it will now include an additional element, which is the sum of `r_index` and `n`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_queue` has one more element including `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
