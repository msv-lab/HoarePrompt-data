The code appends the current value of `i` to the `r_queue` list. Given that `i` is initialized to 0, the value appended to `r_queue` will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains the value 0, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains the value 0, and `i` is 0**
