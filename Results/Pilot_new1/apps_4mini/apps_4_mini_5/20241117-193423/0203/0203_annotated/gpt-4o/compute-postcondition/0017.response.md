Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string with at least 3 characters; if `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the value 2 appended to it, resulting in either [0, 1, 2], [1, 2], [2], or [2] if previously empty, while `r_queue` remains empty; if `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` remains unchanged, and `r_queue` now contains the value 2 appended to it, resulting in either [1, 2] or [0, 1, 2], depending on its previous state. `i` is 2 and `v` is the third character in `votes`.***
