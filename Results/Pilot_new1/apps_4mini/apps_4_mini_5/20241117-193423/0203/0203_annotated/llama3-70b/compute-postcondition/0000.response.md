The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000, and the variable `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. However, the value of `fractions` is not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `n` is assigned the value of the input integer.**
