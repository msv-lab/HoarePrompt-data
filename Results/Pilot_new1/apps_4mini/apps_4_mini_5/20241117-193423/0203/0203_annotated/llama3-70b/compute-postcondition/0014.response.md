According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters left in the `fractions` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `fraction` is the next character in the string.

Since the loop processes one character at a time from `fractions`, for the loop to execute one more time, the string `fractions` must have at least one additional character beyond the current `fraction`. Consequently, the `fraction` must be updated to the next character in the string.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one more character in `fractions`, and `fraction` should be the next character in the string after the current one.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one**
