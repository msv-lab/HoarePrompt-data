The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` is a string input by the user, but these variables are not affected by the assignment of `depublicans`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `fractions`, along with the new value of `depublicans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string input by the user, `depublicans` is 0**
