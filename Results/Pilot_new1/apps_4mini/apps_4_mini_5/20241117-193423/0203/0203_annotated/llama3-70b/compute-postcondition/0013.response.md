Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more character, and `fraction` is the next character in the string. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1. This handles the case where `fraction` can be any character other than 'D', ensuring that one of the two counters is always incremented based on the value of `fraction`.***
