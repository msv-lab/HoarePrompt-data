The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input. The initial state does not specify the value of `fractions`, so it will be assigned whatever string is inputted by the user. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was previously assigned an input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string input by the user**
