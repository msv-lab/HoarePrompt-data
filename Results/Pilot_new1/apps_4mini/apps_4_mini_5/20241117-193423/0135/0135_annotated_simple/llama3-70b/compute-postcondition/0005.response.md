The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged because the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the function prints 'No'**
