To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

The task is to check if the remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program uses a set to track the remainders and checks for duplicates.

Let's break down the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Set Initialization**: A set named `seen` is initialized to keep track of the unique remainders.
3. **Loop through integers**: The program iterates through all integers `i` from `1` to `k`:
   - It calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
   - It checks if this remainder has already been seen (exists in the `seen` set).
   - If it has been seen, it prints "No" and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If it hasn't been seen, it adds the remainder to the `seen` set.
4. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Cases

1. **When k = 1**: The only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Thus, the output should be "Yes" since there are no pairs to compare.
2. **When n < k**: For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be `0, 1, 0, 2, 2` for `i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5` respectively. Here, `0` and `2` repeat, so the output should be "No".
3. **Large Values**: The program needs to handle large values for `n` and `k` efficiently, but since it only checks up to `k`, it should be fine as long as Python can handle the integers.

### Potential Issue

The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n`. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the remainders would be:
- `n % 1 = 0`
- `n % 2 = 0`
- `n % 3 = 2`

Here, `0` is repeated for `i = 1` and `i = 2`, so the output should be "No". The program correctly identifies this case, but it does not explicitly check for the situation where `k` is larger than `n` in a more optimized way.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and the potential cases, it appears that the program does correctly check for distinct remainders for all cases, including edge cases and larger values of `n` and `k`.

Correctness: **True**
