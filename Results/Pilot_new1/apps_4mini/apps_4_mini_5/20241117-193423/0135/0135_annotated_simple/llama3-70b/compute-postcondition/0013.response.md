Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, which is either 0 or 1, and if `remainder` is found in `seen`, 'No' is printed and the program exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution beyond this point.***
