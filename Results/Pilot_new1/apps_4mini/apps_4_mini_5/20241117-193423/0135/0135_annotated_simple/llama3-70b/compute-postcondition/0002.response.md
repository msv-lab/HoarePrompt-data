According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as it iterates from 1 to `k`. The variable `i` will start at 1 at the beginning of the first iteration. The values of `n` and `seen` do not affect the execution of the loop in this case.

To ensure the loop executes, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
