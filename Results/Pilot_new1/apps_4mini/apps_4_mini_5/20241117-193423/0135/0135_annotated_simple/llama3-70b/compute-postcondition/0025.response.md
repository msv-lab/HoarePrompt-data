Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and checks the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, the function prints 'No' and exits. If there are no repeated remainders, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value and does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, in which case it will print 'Yes' since the loop will not execute.**
