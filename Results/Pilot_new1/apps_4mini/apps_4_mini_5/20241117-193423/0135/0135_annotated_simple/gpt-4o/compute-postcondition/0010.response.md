The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 2, so `remainder` will be the result of `n` modulo 2. The specific value of `n` is not provided, but it is an integer. Therefore, the value of `remainder` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
