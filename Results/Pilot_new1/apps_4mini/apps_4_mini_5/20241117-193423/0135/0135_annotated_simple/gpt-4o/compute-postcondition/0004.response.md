According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to and including `k`. The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment up to `k`. 

Since `n` and `seen_remainders` do not affect the execution of the loop, they can remain unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `k` needs to be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
