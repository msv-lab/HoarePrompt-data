`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `remainder` will be equal to `n % 1`, which is always 0 for any integer `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
