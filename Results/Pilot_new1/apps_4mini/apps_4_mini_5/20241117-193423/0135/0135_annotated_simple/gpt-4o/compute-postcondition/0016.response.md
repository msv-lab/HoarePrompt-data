The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. 
- If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return any value. 
- In Case 2, if `k` is at least 1, the function computes the remainders of `n` modulo each integer from 1 to `k` and stores them in a set called `seen_remainders`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. 
- In Case 3, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, check the relationship between them, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, while returning 'Yes' if `k` is less than `n` and at least 1, without returning any value if `k` is less than `n` but not at least 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, does not return any value if `k` is less than `n`, and returns 'Yes' if `k` is less than `n` and at least 1.**
