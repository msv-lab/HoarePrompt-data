Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the output is 'No' and the program exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution without producing any output.***
