The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate with two integer values, `n` and `k`, which must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, without further details about the output, we cannot describe the return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates with two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The return value is not specified.**
