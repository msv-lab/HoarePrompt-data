Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` from user input and checks whether the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are unique. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value. Additionally, if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and it will directly print 'Yes' since there are no remainders to check. **
