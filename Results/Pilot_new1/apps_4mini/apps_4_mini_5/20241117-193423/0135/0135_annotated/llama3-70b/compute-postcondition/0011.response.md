The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` now contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**.
