The variable `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. Since `seen` already contains `remainder` (which is 0), the state of `seen` will not change, but the program logic indicates that if `remainder` is in `seen`, the output should be 'No' and the program exits. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No' as the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains `remainder` (0), `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**
