To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, we need to analyze the logic of the code and how it aligns with the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
The goal is to check whether all remainders of `n` divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The conditions specify:
- For any two integers `i` and `j` (where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`), the condition `n % i` should not equal `n % j`.

### Code Analysis
The code reads two integers `n` and `k`, and initializes an empty set called `seen`. It then iterates over the range from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each integer `i`. If the remainder has already been seen (exists in the set), it prints "No" and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints "Yes".

### Annotations Analysis
The annotations summarize the function's behavior:
- It correctly initializes the set to track seen remainders.
- It exits early if a duplicate remainder is found, which aligns with the requirement to check for distinctness.
- It notes that if `k` is less than `1`, the loop does not execute, and it will print "Yes" since there are no remainders to check. However, based on the problem description, `k` is guaranteed to be at least `1`, so this point does not affect the current analysis.

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the remainder is `1 % 1 = 0`. This case should return "Yes" since there are no duplicates.
2. **Identical Remainders**: For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders are:
   - `4 % 1 = 0`
   - `4 % 2 = 0`
   - `4 % 3 = 1`
   - `4 % 4 = 0`
   Here, the output should be "No" because `0` is repeated.
3. **Large Values**: For `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`, the program would still correctly compute each remainder, but performance considerations aside, the logic remains consistent.

### Conclusion
The code accurately implements the logic required by the problem description. It successfully checks for duplicate remainders and handles the edge cases outlined in the problem description.

Given that the program correctly handles all specified cases and adheres to the problem requirements without any missing logic or edge cases, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True** 

The program correctly identifies whether all remainders are distinct for the range specified by `k`, and the annotations align with the code's behavior.
