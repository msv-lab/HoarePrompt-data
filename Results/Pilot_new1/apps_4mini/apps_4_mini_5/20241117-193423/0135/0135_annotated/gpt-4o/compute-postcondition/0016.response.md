The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- Case 1: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return anything.
- Case 2: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No' and the loop does not execute. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop executes up to `k` times. After the loop, if a remainder is repeated during the loop, the function returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder, there is no return value, and `seen_remainders` contains unique remainders from the divisions.
- Case 3: If the conditions are satisfied and no duplicates are found, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it will return 'No' if any remainders repeat during the loop, and return 'Yes' if all remainders are unique. If none of these conditions are met, the function does not return anything. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if any remainders repeat during the loop when `k` is less than `n`. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'.**
