Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats during this process, the function returns 'No'; if all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than `n`, and the loop completes without finding a duplicate remainder, the function returns 'Yes'.**
