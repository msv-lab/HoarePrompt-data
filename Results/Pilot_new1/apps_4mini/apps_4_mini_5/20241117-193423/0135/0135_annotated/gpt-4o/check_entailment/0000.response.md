To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the given problem description, the code, and the annotations.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check if all the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there is no pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Annotations:
1. **If `k >= n`, return 'No'**: This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders will repeat. For example, `n mod n` will always be `0` and `n mod 1` will also always be `0`, thus producing non-distinct remainders.
   
2. **If `k < n`, check for unique remainders**: The program uses a set to track seen remainders. If a remainder is found again during the loop, it returns 'No'. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns 'Yes'.

### Code Logic:
- The program first checks if `k >= n` and returns 'No' if true.
- If `k < n`, it iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating `n mod i` for each `i` and checks for duplicates using a set.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case where `k < n` but `k` is very small**: For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 2`, the remainders would be:
   - `10 mod 1 = 0`
   - `10 mod 2 = 0`
   This results in non-distinct remainders, and the program should return 'No'. The program correctly identifies this case.

2. **When `k` is `1`**: For any `n`, `n mod 1` will always be `0`, which means for `k = 1`, the program should return 'No'. The program correctly handles this since `k < n` will not be checked and `k >= n` returns 'No'.

3. **When `n` is very large and `k` is very small**: If `n = 10^18` and `k = 1`, the program will return 'No' correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to check for distinct remainders according to the problem description and handles all edge cases as discussed. There are no cases where it fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
