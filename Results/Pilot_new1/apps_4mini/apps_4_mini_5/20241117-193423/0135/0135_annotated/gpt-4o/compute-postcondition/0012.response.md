The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 3, and `i` is 3. Since `n` is greater than `k`, `n` must also be greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the possible values for `remainder` can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is divisible by 3 or not. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
