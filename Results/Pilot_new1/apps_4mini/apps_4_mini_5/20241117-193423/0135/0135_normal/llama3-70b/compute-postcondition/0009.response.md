According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an input integer, which could be any value. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. However, we also need to ensure that `k` is at least 2, so that `i` (now 2) is still less than or equal to `k`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 2, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is a set that now includes 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is 0**
