Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the output is 'No' and the program exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution without printing anything.***
