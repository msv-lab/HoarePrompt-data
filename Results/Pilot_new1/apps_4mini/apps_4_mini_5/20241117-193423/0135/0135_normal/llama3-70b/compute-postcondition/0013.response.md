Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is a set that includes 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution beyond this point.***
