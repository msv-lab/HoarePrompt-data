To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code first.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

1. **Functionality**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`, initializes an empty set called `seen`, and iterates through integers from `1` to `k`. For each integer `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If this remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits. If no remainders are repeated, it prints "Yes".

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k = 1`, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Thus, the output should be "Yes" because there are no pairs `(i, j)` to compare.
   - If `k > n`, the remainders for `i` from `n + 1` to `k` will be `n` itself since `n mod i = n` for `i > n`. Thus, for `k > n`, the program will correctly output "Yes" for all `i > n` since those will not repeat any of the previously computed remainders.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- The output hints state that the program calculates remainders and checks for repetitions. They also mention that if `k` is less than `1`, the loop does not execute and "Yes" is printed immediately. However, the constraints specify that `k` is at least `1`, so this case does not apply.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles the edge cases effectively, including the case where `k = 1` and `k > n`. 

Therefore, after analyzing both the code and the output hints, I find no discrepancies or potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
