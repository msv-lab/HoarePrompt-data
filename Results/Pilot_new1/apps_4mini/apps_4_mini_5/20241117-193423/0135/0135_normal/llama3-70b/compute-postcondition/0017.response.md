The `print('No')` statement outputs the string 'No' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged as this line does not modify any of them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes 0 (and possibly 1), `i` is 3, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the output is 'No'**.
