To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code logic.

### Problem Description Summary:
The task is to determine if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by each integer `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to check for any duplicates in the remainders `n mod i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. It has a condition that if `k >= n`, it immediately returns 'No'. This is correct, as the remainders for `i` values from `1` to `n` will repeat (for example, `n mod n` is `0`).
3. It initializes a set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders observed.
4. It iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`, calculates the remainder `n mod i`, and checks if this remainder has already been seen:
   - If it has, it returns 'No'.
   - If it hasn't, it adds the remainder to the set.
5. If no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
- The program does not explicitly handle cases where `k < 1`, but according to the problem constraints (`1 â‰¤ n, k`), this situation should not occur.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, which is crucial since it guarantees that at least one remainder will be repeated.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints state that:
- The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for duplicate remainders and returns 'No' if found, otherwise 'Yes'.
- It mentions that the function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, which is not a valid input based on the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program logic aligns with the problem description. It correctly identifies when duplicates exist in the remainders and handles the specified conditions appropriately. The output hints also align with the code's logic, confirming that the program behaves as expected for valid input ranges.

Since there are no identified edge cases where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly checks for distinct remainders for valid values of `n` and `k` as per the problem description.
