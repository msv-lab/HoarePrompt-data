To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1(n, k)` against the problem description.

The function checks whether all remainders of `n` divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Here's the breakdown of the logic:

1. If `k >= n`, the function returns 'No'. This is because for any `i` where `i >= n`, `n % i` will always be `n` (since `n` is less than `i`), leading to non-distinct remainders.

2. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to track the remainders encountered.

3. It iterates through each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, computes the remainder `n % i`, and checks if this remainder has been seen before:
   - If it has, it returns 'No'.
   - If it hasn't, it adds the remainder to the set.

4. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns 'Yes'.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- **Case when `k < n`:** The program should correctly handle this situation since it will check all values from `1` to `k`. However, the logic might fail if `k` is very large compared to `n` because of the way the function is structured. Specifically, if `k` is larger than `n`, the function will return 'No' without checking all possible values, which is correct.

- **Case when `k = 1`:** Here, `n % 1` is always `0`, so the output should be 'No' since there are no distinct remainders.

- **Case when `n` is very large and `k` is small:** For example, if `n = 10^18` and `k = 2`, the remainders would be:
  - `10^18 % 1 = 0`
  - `10^18 % 2 = 0`
  This would also return 'No', which is expected.

- **Case when `n = k`:** For instance, if `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders would be:
  - `4 % 1 = 0`
  - `4 % 2 = 0`
  - `4 % 3 = 1`
  - `4 % 4 = 0`
  This would return 'No', which is correct.

However, there is a crucial edge case that the program does not handle correctly:

- **Case when `k > n`:** The program should return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. For example, with `n = 5` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1`
  - `5 % 5 = 0`
  This case would yield duplicate remainders (0 and 1), but the function would incorrectly return 'Yes' due to the logic of returning 'No' only when `k >= n`.

Thus, the function fails to correctly identify all distinct remainders in this situation.

Correctness: **False**.
