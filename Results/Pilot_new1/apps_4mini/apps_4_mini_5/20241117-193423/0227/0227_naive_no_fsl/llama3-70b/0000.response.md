Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the minimum number of variables \( m \) needed to perform the described sequence of operations based on the input sequence \( a \).

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Variables**:
   - The program increments \( m \) every time it finds an element in \( a \) that is not double the previous element. However, this does not accurately reflect the requirement that each operation must result in the value of \( a_t \). The logic of simply checking for doubling does not account for the possibility of needing additional variables for sums that do not follow this pattern.

2. **Failure to Handle Non-Constructible Cases**:
   - The program does not correctly return -1 for cases where it is impossible to create the required sequence with any number of variables. For example, if the input is:
     ```
     3
     3 6 5
     ```
     The correct output should be -1 because it is impossible to create the number 5 from the previous numbers (3 and 6) using the allowed operations.

### Example of Failure:
For the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The program will incorrectly output `2`, as it only checks for doubling and does not consider that 5 cannot be formed through any combination of 3 and 6. 

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
