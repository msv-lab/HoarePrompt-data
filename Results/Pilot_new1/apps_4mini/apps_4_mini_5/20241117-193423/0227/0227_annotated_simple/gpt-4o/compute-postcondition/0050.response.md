The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty list, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of the list `assigned`; `can_form` is True.
