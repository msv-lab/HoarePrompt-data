The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, but this does not affect the previous values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `m`, `n`, `i`, `assigned`, and `x`, while `can_form` is now `True`.

Output State: **`m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
