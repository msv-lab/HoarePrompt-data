Postcondition: ***Given that `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is an iterable containing at least 3 elements, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `x` is the third element in `assigned`, if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues without setting it to True.***
