The value of `can_form` is assigned as `False`. Since `can_form` is already `False`, it does not change. The other variables `assigned`, `n`, `m`, and `i` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values and the current state of `can_form`.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2**
