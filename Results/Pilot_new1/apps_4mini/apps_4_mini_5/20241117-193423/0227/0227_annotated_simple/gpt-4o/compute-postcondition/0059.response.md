The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a list with at least 3 elements, `x` is the last element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
