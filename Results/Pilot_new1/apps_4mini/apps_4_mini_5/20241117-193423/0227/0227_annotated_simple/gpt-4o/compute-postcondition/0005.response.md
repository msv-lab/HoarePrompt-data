The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this assignment. The values of `n`, `i`, `assigned`, and `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `can_form` while indicating that the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a[0], `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers, `can_form` is False**
