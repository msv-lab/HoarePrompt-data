The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is an iterable containing at least 1 element, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
