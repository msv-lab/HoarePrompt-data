The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where `n` is an input integer between 1 and 23. The sorting operation will rearrange the elements of `a` but does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers**
