The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers based on user input, the previous state of `a` is a list of these integers. After executing the sort operation, the order of the integers in `a` will change to be in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and there are no other variables affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers**
