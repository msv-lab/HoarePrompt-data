Output State: **`m` is equal to the count of elements in `a` that are not double the previous element, starting from an initial value of 1. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 1. If `n` is 2 or more, the loop executes `n-1` times, and `m` may increase depending on the values in `a`.**
