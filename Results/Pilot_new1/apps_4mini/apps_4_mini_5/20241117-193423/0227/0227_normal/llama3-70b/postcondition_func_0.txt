The function accepts an integer input `n` representing the number of elements, followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list are not double the previous element, starting from an initial count of 1. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
