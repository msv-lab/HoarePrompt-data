Output State: **`can_form` will be True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[3]` and that element is also in `assigned`. If no such element exists, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` has at least one element, the loop will execute at least once.**
