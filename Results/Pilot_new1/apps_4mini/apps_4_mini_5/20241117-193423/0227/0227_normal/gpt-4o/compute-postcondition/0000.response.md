The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is within the range of 1 to \(10^9\). The sorting operation does not change the values of `n` or the distinct integers themselves, but it rearranges the order of the elements in `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_k` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_k` ≤ 10^9**
