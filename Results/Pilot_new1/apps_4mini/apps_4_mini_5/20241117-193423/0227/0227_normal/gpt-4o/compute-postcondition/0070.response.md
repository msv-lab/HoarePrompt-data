The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_k` satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9. The function returns the number of elements in the list `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in a set called 'assigned', which is represented by the value of `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`, and return the count of elements in `a` that cannot be represented as the difference of any two elements in the specified set. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list of n distinct integers a, and returns the number of elements in a that cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in 'assigned'.**
