Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[0]`, and if the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, retaining its initial state.***
