The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
