Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers. It returns the count of elements in `a` that cannot be represented as the difference of any two previously processed elements in the list. If `n` is 1, it will return 1 since there are no pairs to form a difference. The function processes each element in `a`, and if an element cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in a set of previously processed elements, it increments the count. **
