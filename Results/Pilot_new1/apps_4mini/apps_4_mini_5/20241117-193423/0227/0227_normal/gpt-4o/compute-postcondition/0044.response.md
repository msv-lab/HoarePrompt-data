Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. Additionally, `assigned` contains elements that are checked against, `i` is incremented for each iteration starting from 2, and `n` is greater than 2. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` is False and `m` is increased by 1, while `i` is still initialized to 2 and `n` remains greater than 2.***
