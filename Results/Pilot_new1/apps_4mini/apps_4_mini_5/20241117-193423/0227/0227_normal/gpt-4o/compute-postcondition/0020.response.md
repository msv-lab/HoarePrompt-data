Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists any element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` (where `x` is an element of `assigned`) is also in `assigned`. If no such element exists in `assigned` after all iterations, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains less than 1 element, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.**
