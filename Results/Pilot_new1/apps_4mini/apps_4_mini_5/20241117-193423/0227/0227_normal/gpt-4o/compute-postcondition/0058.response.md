The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables (`assigned`, `i`, `n`, or `x`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`assigned` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
