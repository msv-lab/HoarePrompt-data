Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[2]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, and `m` is increased by 1. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, `m` is still increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least 1 element (specifically, `a[2]`), `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2.***
