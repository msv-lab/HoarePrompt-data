Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, meaning either `assigned` contains less than 1 element or all iterations have confirmed that no element in `assigned` satisfies the condition where the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged.***
