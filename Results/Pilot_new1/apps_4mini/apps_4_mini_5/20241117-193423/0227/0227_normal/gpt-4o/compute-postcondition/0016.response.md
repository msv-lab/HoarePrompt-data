The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
