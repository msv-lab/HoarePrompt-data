According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, and `x` is that first element. For the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must contain at least one more element after the first one. Since `n` is greater than 1, `assigned` must include at least two elements.

Given that `x` is currently the first element of `assigned`, the next iteration will need `x` to be the second element of `assigned`. Thus, `assigned` should be adjusted to contain at least two elements, and `x` should be set to the second element of `assigned`.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least two elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `assigned`**
