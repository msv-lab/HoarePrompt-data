The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer satisfies the condition `1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9`. Sorting the list will rearrange its elements but will not change the number of elements or their distinct nature. Therefore, the output state will reflect the sorted order of the list `a`, but we do not have specific values for the elements of `a` or their arrangement.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9**
