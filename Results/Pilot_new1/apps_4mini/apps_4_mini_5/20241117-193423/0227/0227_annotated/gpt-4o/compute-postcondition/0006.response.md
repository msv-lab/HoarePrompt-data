According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` set. The loop will execute if the `assigned` set contains at least one element. Since `assigned` is stated to contain the first element of `a`, it will have at least one element as long as `a` is not empty. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `x` will take on the value of the first element in the `assigned` set. Given that `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `x` will be that first element.

The other states (`n`, `a`, `m`, `i`, `can_form`) do not directly impact the execution of the loop but may be relevant for the loop body. However, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `assigned` is not empty.

Thus, the state can be summarized as:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element of `assigned`**
