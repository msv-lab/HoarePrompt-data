Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` (where `x` is an element of `assigned`) is also in `assigned`; otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` contains fewer than two elements, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. Additionally, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains elements from `a`, `m` is 1, and `i` is 1.**
