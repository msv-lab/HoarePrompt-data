Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, making it either 3 or 4. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains either 2 or 3. The variable `assigned` contains the elements being checked, and `i` is a valid index ensuring that `a[i + 1]` is also valid. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and thus `m` is incremented. If `assigned` has only one element, `can_form` will only be True if `a[i] - assigned[0]` matches that single element, otherwise `m` is incremented.***
