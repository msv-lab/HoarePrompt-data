Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `m` remains either 2 or 3, `assigned` contains at least two elements, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. If the condition is met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop, indicating that the condition was satisfied; otherwise, there is no change to the variables involved.***
