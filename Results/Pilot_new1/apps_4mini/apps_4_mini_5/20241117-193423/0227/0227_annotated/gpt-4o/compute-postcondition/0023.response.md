Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` (where `x` is an element of `assigned`) is also in `assigned`; otherwise, if `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased to 2. Additionally, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, and `assigned` contains elements from `a`. If `assigned` contains fewer than two elements, `can_form` remains False and `m` is also 2.***
