Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether any element in `assigned` satisfies the condition that the difference between `a[2]` and that element exists in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, resulting in `m` being 3. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains 2. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is 3. Thus, the final value of `m` is either 2 or 3 depending on the value of `can_form`.***
