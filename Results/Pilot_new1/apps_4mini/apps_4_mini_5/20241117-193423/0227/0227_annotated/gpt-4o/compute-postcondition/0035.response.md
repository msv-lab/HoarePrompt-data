Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, indicating that the program has successfully identified a valid configuration; `m` remains 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged and the loop continues without any further action.***
