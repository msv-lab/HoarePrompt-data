Postcondition: ***If the value of `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains either 2 or 3, `assigned` contains at least three elements, and `x` is the next element in `assigned` after the current one; if these conditions are met, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value is not found, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
