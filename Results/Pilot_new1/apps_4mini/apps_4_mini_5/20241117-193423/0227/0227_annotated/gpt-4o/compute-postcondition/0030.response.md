The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased to 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements from `a`, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and the difference between the element at index `i` of `a` and `x` is present in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
