Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of distinct positive integers and a list `a` of `n` integers. It counts how many integers in the sorted list are not exactly double the previous integer. If the count `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, it directly outputs 1 since there are no previous integers to compare. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the range of 1 to 23, nor does it validate the input for positive integers. **
