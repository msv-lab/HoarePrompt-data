According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1` (since the range is from 1 to `n`, and the upper limit is exclusive).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and `n` must be at least 5 (since `n` must be greater than `i`).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 4.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 to allow for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 4, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers.**
