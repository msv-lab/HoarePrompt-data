Output State: **`m` is equal to the count of elements in `a` that are not exactly double the previous element in the sorted list of distinct positive integers. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute and `m` remains 1. For `n` greater than or equal to 2, the loop executes `n-1` times, with `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`. If all elements satisfy the condition `a[i] == a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` will remain 1, otherwise `m` will be incremented for each instance where the condition is not met.**
