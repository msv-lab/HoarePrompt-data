The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous state of `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the state of the list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a_k satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a_k satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9**
