The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `x` is an integer greater than `y`, the value of `abs(x - y)` is simply `x - y`. The previous values of `x` and `y` are within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `y`, `y` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the output is `x - y`**
