The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided by the user. The input is split into two integers, which are then mapped to `x` and `y`. The initial state indicates that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the input provided, but the relationship between them remains valid. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now updated based on the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers based on input such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
