The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the input, which are integers. The initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100000\). The specific values for `x` and `y` will be determined by the input provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now set to the respective integers provided by the user input while maintaining the constraints given.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 100000; `y` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ `y` < `x`**
