The expression calculates the result of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. The variables `x` and `y` are new integers based on input, and they satisfy the conditions `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`. The value of `x - y` will be a positive integer since `x` is greater than `y`.

The operation `(x - y) // 2` computes the integer division of the difference by 2, while `(x - y) % 2` computes the remainder when that difference is divided by 2. This means the result accounts for both the whole number part and any leftover from the division.

Since `x` and `y` are not specified but are integers within the given range, we cannot determine exact values for the output. However, we can state that the output will be a non-negative integer based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are new integers based on input satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; the result is a non-negative integer based on the calculation of (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2.**
