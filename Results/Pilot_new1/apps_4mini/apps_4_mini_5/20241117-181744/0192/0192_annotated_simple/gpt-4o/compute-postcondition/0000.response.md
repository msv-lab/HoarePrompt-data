The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on user input, which are integers. The conditions state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, ensuring that `y` must be less than `x`, and both are constrained between the specified limits. The previous values of `x` and `y` are replaced with the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` are now new integers based on the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are new integers based on input, satisfying the conditions 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
