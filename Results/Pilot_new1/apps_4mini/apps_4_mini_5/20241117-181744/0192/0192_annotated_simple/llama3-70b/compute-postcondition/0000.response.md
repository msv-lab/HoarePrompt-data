The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input().split()` takes two integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now defined by the input but remain within the specified constraints. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
