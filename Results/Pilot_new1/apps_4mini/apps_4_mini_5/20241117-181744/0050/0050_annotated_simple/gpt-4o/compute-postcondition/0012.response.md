Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers from input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, if `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and the total amount of bourles after selling the shares is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, which is then printed. Additionally, the scenario where `max_sell_price` equals `min_buy_price` results in no shares being sold, and `r` being printed directly is also covered.***
