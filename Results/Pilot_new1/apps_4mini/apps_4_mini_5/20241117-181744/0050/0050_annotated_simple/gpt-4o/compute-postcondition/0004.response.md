The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The initial state does not provide the value of `b`, but it is implied that `b` is related to the input values and potentially the list `s`. Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its maximum value. Therefore, the output state indicates that the maximum sell price is not defined due to the absence of `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers from input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is not defined due to the absence of `b`.**
