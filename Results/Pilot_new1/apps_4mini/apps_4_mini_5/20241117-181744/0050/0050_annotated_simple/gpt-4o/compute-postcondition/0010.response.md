Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers from input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is larger than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`; `total_bourles` is calculated as max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles.**
