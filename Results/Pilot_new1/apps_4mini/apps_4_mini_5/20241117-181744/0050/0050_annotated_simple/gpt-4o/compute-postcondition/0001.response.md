The variable `s` is assigned a list of integers obtained from user input, where the input is split into separate values and converted into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this operation, and `s` will now hold a new list of integers based on the input. The values of `s` will depend on the input provided, but since `s` is being created anew, its previous state is not applicable. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers from input.**
