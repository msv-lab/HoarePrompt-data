The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned from the input, which consists of three integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, but they must satisfy the constraints provided (1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000). Other variables `s` and `b` remain unaffected at this stage. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of the new values to `n`, `m`, and `r` from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` and `b` remain unchanged**
