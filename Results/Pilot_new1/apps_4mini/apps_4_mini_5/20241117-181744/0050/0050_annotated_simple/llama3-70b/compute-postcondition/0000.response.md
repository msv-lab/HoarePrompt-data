The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned from the input, where `input()` reads a line of input, `split()` divides it into separate values, and `map(int, ...)` converts those values to integers. The previous states of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown since they are being set based on user input. Other variables (`s` and `b`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is that `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned input integers; `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers**
