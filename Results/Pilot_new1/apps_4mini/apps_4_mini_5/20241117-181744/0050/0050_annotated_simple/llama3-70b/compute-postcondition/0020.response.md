The operation `r %= s[i]` updates the value of `r` by taking the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[i]`. The variable `s` is a sorted list of integers, and since `i` is 1, `s[i]` refers to the second element in the list `s`. The specific value of `r` is not given, but it will be updated based on its current value and the value of `s[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the output state will reflect that `r` has been updated based on the modulus operation, while the values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `i`, and `shares` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `i` is 1, `shares` is updated based on `r // s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`.**
