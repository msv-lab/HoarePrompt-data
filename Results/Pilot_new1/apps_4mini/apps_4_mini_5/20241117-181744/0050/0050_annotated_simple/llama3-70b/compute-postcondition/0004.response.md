The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The sorted list `b` now contains its elements in descending order. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and the updated state of `b`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order**
