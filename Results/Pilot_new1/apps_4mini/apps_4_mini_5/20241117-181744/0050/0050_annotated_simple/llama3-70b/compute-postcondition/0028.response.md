The value of `shares` is assigned 0. This assignment does not affect any of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `m` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 0, `shares` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 0, `shares` is 0**
