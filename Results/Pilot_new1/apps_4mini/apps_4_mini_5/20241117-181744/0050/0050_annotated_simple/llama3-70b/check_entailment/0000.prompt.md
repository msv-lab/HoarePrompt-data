You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Welcome to Codeforces Stock Exchange! We're pretty limited now as we currently allow trading on one stock, Codeforces Ltd. We hope you'll still be able to make profit from the market!

In the morning, there are $n$ opportunities to buy shares. The $i$-th of them allows to buy as many shares as you want, each at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

In the evening, there are $m$ opportunities to sell shares. The $i$-th of them allows to sell as many shares as you want, each at the price of $b_i$ bourles. You can't sell more shares than you have.

It's morning now and you possess $r$ bourles and no shares.

What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains three integers $n, m, r$ ($1 \leq n \leq 30$, $1 \leq m \leq 30$, $1 \leq r \leq 1000$) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

The next line contains $n$ integers $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 1000$); $s_i$ indicates the opportunity to buy shares at the price of $s_i$ bourles.

The following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 1000$); $b_i$ indicates the opportunity to sell shares at the price of $b_i$ bourles.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
4 2 5
4 4 5 4

Output
26

Input
2 2 50
5 7
4 2

Output
50



-----Note-----

In the first example test, you have $11$ bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy $5$ shares of a stock at the price of $2$ bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of $5$ bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have $26$ bourles after the evening.

In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, m, r = map(int, input().split())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s.sort()
    b.sort(reverse=True)
    shares = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if r >= s[i]:
            shares += r // s[i]
            r %= s[i]
        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `n` is greater than 0 and `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, the loop will execute up to `n` times, updating `shares` to the total number of shares obtained from dividing `r` by each `s[i]` until `r` becomes less than `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop does not execute, and `shares` remains 0 with `r` retaining its original value. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `shares` remains 0 with `r` unchanged. Additionally, if `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `shares` remains 0 with `r` unchanged.
    for i in range(m):
        if shares > 0:
            r += shares * b[i]
            shares = 0
        else:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `m` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, and `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, the loop will execute up to `m` times. If `shares` is greater than 0 during each iteration, `r` will be updated by adding `shares * b[i]`, and `shares` will be set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0 at any point, the loop will terminate early, leaving `r` unchanged, and `shares` will remain at its last value. If `m` is 0, `s` is empty, or `r` is less than `s[0]`, the loop does not execute, and `shares` remains 0 with `r` unchanged.
    print(r)

```


If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
