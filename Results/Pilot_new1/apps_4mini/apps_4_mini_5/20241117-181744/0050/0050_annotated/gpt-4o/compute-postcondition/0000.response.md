The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on the input provided by the user. The input consists of three integers, which are then converted into integers using the `map` function. The previous states of the variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown, as they will be assigned new values from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers based on user input**
