Functionality: ** The function reads integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input, along with two lists of integers `s` (buy prices) and `b` (sell prices). It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum shares that can be bought with `r`, computes the remaining bourles after the purchase, and prints the total bourles that can be obtained by selling the shares at the maximum sell price, plus any remaining bourles. The function does not handle cases where the lists `s` or `b` are empty, which would lead to errors when calculating minimum or maximum prices.**
