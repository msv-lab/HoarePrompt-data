The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into separate values. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this operation, as they are based on user input and do not change during this code execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `s` being a list of integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers based on user input; `s` is a list of integers based on user input**
