The variable `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The previous values of `b` are based on user input, so the exact value of `max_sell_price` will depend on the contents of `b`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `min_buy_price` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and indicate that `max_sell_price` has been calculated.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers based on user input; `s` is a list of integers based on user input; `b` is a list of integers based on user input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`.**
