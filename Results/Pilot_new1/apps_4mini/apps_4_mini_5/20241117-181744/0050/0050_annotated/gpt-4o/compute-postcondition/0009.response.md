The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, which calculates the remainder when `r` is divided by `min_buy_price`. The previous values of `r` and `min_buy_price` are required to understand the impact. Since `r` is an integer based on user input and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, the output state will reflect these calculations.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers based on user input; `s` is a list of integers based on user input; `b` is a list of integers based on user input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.**
