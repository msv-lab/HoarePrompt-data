The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30; `r`, which is an integer such that 1 <= r <= 1000; `s`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `s_i` satisfies 1 <= `s_i` <= 1000; and `b`, which is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= `b_i` <= 1000. 

The function's output is not explicitly described in the given information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return value or conditions based on the provided output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, a list s of n integers, and a list b of m integers, but the return value is not specified.**
