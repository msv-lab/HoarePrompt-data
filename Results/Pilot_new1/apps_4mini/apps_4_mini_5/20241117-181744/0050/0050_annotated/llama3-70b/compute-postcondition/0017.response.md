Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is sorted in reverse order, and `i` is 1. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[1]`, then `shares` is increased by the integer division of `r` by `s[1]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[1]`. If `r` is less than `s[1]`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `shares` and `r` unchanged from their previous values. This ensures that the operations on `shares` and `r` are only performed when `r` is sufficient to cover `s[1]`.***
