According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as the smallest value in `s`, and we do not have the exact value of `i` but can infer that it must be less than `m` for the loop to continue. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect that it has been incremented by 1. Therefore, we can express the state at the start of the next iteration as:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as the smallest value in `s`, `i` is less than `m`**
