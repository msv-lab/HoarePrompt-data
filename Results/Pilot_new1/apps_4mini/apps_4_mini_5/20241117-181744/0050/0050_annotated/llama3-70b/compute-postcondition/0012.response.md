Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is sorted in reverse order, and `shares` is updated based on the value of `r`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `shares` remains 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This ensures that `shares` reflects the number of complete shares that can be obtained from `r` using the current value of `s[i]`, while `r` retains any remainder after the division.***
