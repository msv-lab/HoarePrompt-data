The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as the smallest value in `s`, `i` is less than `m`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
