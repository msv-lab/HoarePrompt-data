According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Since `m` is greater than 0, it ensures that the loop can continue executing as long as `i` remains less than `m`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `i` is 2, and `m` is greater than 0**
