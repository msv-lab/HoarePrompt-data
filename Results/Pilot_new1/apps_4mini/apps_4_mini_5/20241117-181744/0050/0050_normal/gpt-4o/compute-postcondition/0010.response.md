To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we analyze the impact on the variables involved based on the initial state.

1. **Initial Variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `r` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of input integers.
   - `b` is a list of input integers.
   - `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`.
   - `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`.
   - `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.
   - `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The line `total_bourles = max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles` computes the total bourles. 
   - `max_shares` is multiplied by `max_sell_price`, and then `remaining_bourles` is added to this product.

3. **Output Variables**:
   - `total_bourles` is assigned the computed value based on the calculations involving `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles`.

Since the specific values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` are not provided, we summarize the state based on the relationships defined:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from `b`, `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`, `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
