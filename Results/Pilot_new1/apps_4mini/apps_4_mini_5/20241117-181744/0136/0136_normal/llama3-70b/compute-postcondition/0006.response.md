The code prints the string '<', which indicates a comparison between the two non-negative integers represented by `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are not equal, and `a` is less than `b`, confirming that the printed output is correct. The values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; the values of `a` and `b` are not equal; `a` is less than `b`, and the output is '<'.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; the values of `a` and `b` are not equal; `a` is less than `b`, and the output is '<'**
