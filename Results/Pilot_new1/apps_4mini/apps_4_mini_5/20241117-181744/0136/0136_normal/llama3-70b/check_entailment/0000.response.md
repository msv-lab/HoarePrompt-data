The provided code is designed to compare two very long integers given as strings, after removing any leading zeroes. It checks for equality and determines which number is greater, following the problem description.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Leading Zeroes:** The code uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeroes from both numbers. This is appropriate since leading zeroes do not contribute to the value of the integers.
2. **Comparison Logic:** After stripping leading zeroes, it directly compares the two strings:
   - If they are equal, it prints '='.
   - If the first number is less than the second, it prints '<'.
   - If the first number is greater than the second, it prints '>'.
3. **Handling Edge Cases:** The code handles edge cases such as:
   - Both numbers being zero (e.g., "0" and "0").
   - One number being zero and the other being non-zero (e.g., "0" and "123").
   - Very large numbers (up to 10^6 digits) since string comparison in Python works lexicographically.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- If both inputs are "0", the code will print '=', which is correct.
- If one number has leading zeroes and the other does not, the leading zeroes will be stripped, and the comparison will still yield the correct result.
- The code could potentially fail if the input is empty or contains invalid characters, but the problem description states that the input will be valid non-negative integers.

### Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints state that the function accepts two non-negative integers as strings, removes leading zeroes, and compares them. It correctly describes the output behavior:
- It prints '=' if the numbers are equal.
- It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second.
- It prints '>' if the first number is greater than the second.

The output hints agree with the code. They accurately reflect the logic of the code and the expected behavior for valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Given that the code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and that it handles the specified edge cases appropriately, I find no examples where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**. 

### Explanation:
The code correctly compares two non-negative integers represented as strings, handles leading zeroes appropriately, and accurately prints the comparison result according to the problem description. All edge cases outlined in the description and hints are covered.
