Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the first element in `data` without leading zeros, and if `a` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. `b` remains the string representation of `data[1]` without leading zeros. If `a` was originally empty, it is now '0', otherwise it retains its original value.***
