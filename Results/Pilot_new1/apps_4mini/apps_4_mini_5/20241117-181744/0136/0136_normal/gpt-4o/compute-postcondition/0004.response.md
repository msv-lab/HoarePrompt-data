The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `a` was an empty string, but now it is updated to `'0'`. The variable `b` remains unchanged as the assignment of `a` does not affect it. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is `'0'`, `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` without leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string representation of `data[1]` without leading zeros**
