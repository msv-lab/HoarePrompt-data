The value of `data[0]` is the first element in the list `data`, which is a string. The method `lstrip('0')` removes any leading zeros from this string. The resulting string is then assigned to `a`. The value of `b` and the contents of `data` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` after removing leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the first element in `data` without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces.**
