The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. The initial state indicates that `b` was an empty string before this assignment. The variable `a` remains unchanged, retaining its original value, which can either be '0' or some other string representation without leading zeros. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b` while `a` remains as it was.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the first element in `data` without leading zeros, and `a` is either '0' or retains its original value; `b` is '0'**
