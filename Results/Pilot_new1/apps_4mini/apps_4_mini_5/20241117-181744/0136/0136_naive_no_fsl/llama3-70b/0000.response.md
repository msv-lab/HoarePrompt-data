Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where both input numbers are zero. If both `a` and `b` are "0", after stripping leading zeros, they become empty strings, which will lead to incorrect comparisons. 

For example:
- Input:
```
0
0
```
- The program will process this as:
```
a = ""
b = ""
```
- The comparison `a == b` will evaluate to `True`, and it will print `=`. However, the expected output should be `=` since both numbers are equal.

This highlights that the program fails to handle the edge case of both inputs being zero correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
