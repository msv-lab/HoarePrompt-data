To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to compare two very long integers (which can have leading zeros) and print:
- `<` if the first number is less than the second,
- `>` if the first number is greater than the second,
- `=` if both numbers are equal.

### Program Analysis
```python
input = sys.stdin.read

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if not a:
        a = '0'
    if not b:
        b = '0'
    if len(a) < len(b):
        print('<')
    elif len(a) > len(b):
        print('>')
    elif a < b:
        print('<')
    elif a > b:
        print('>')
    else:
        print('=')
func_1()
```

### Key Points of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input as a single string and splits it into two parts. This is appropriate for handling large integers as specified.
2. **Leading Zeros**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both integers.
3. **Zero Handling**: If stripping leading zeros results in an empty string, it assigns '0' to ensure that the comparison can proceed without issues.
4. **Length Comparison**: It first compares the lengths of the two numbers to determine which is larger. This is correct since a longer string (after removing leading zeros) represents a larger number.
5. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings lexicographically, which is valid for numeric strings of equal length.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Both Inputs are Zero**: If both inputs are '0', the output should be `=`.
2. **Leading Zeros**: The program correctly handles inputs like '000123' and '123' by stripping leading zeros.
3. **Single Digit Comparisons**: The program should correctly handle cases like '0' vs '1', '1' vs '0', etc.

### Test Cases
Let's consider a few test cases:
- Input: `00000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000` → Output: `=` (Correct)
- Input: `00000000000000000001\n00000000000000000000` → Output: `>` (Correct)
- Input: `00000000000000000000\n00000000000000000001` → Output: `<` (Correct)
- Input: `00000000000000000001\n00000000000000000001` → Output: `=` (Correct)
- Input: `00012345\n12345` → Output: `=` (Correct)

### Conclusion
After reviewing the program and considering edge cases, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles leading zeros, large integers, and provides the correct output for all tested scenarios.

Correctness: **True**.
