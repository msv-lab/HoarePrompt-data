Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when both input numbers are zero, specifically "0" and "0". After stripping leading zeroes, both `a` and `b` will become empty strings, which will cause the comparison `a == b` to evaluate as `True`, leading to an output of `=`. However, the program should output `=` for the case of "0" and "0", but it will fail for cases where both inputs are empty strings. 

Additionally, the program does not account for the scenario where both inputs are leading zeroes, which may not be a case in the examples, but it is a potential edge case that could lead to incorrect behavior. 

Hence, the program does not satisfy the problem requirements for every potential case.
