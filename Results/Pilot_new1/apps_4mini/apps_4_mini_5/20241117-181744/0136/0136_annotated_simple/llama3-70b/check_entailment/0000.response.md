To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and the problem description closely.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to compare two very large non-negative integers `a` and `b`, which may have leading zeroes. The output should be:
- `<` if `a < b`
- `>` if `a > b`
- `=` if `a == b`

### Code Analysis
Here's the annotated program:

```python
def func():
    a = input().lstrip('0')  # Read a and remove leading zeroes
    b = input().lstrip('0')  # Read b and remove leading zeroes
    if (a == b) :
        print('=')
    else :
        if (a < b) :
            print('<')
        else :
            print('>')
```

### Key Points
1. **Removing Leading Zeroes**: The `lstrip('0')` method effectively removes leading zeroes, which is necessary for accurate comparison of the numerical values represented as strings.
2. **String Comparison**: After removing leading zeroes, the program compares the strings `a` and `b`. In Python, string comparison works lexicographically, which is valid for the lengths of the strings:
   - If the lengths of `a` and `b` are different, the longer string represents the larger number.
   - If the lengths are the same, direct string comparison works correctly for numerical values.
3. **Output**: The program correctly prints `=`, `<`, or `>` based on the comparison.

### Edge Cases
1. **Both inputs as zero**: Input like `0` and `0` should output `=`, which is correctly handled.
2. **Leading zeroes**: Inputs like `0000` and `0` should also output `=`, which is handled by `lstrip('0')`.
3. **Different lengths**: Inputs like `000123` and `123` should output `=`, and inputs like `000123` and `0001234` should output `<`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all specified cases, including leading zeroes and edge cases. There are no identified potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately compares the two large integers represented as strings after removing any leading zeros, and it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
