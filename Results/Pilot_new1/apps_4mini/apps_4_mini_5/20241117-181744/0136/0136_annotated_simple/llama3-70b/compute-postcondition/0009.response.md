Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes, and `b` is a string without leading zeroes. Since `a` and `b` are not equal, if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; otherwise, the output is '>', indicating that `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
