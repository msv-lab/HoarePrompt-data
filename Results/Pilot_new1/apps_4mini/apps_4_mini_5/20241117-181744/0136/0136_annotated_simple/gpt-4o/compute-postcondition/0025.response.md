Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string values without leading zeros, with `a` being '0' if initially empty and `b` being '0' if initially empty. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` and `b` have the same length, the output is determined by lexicographical comparison: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if they are equal, the output is '='. All cases are accounted for, including scenarios where either string might be empty, ensuring they are treated as '0'.***
