Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers as strings from user input, removes leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it treats it as '0'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result of the comparison. **
