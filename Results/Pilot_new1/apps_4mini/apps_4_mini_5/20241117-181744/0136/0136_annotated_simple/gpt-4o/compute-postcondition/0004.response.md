The variable `a` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `a` was an empty string, but it is now updated. The value of `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0', `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros**
