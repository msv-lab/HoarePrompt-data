The value of `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes in the input string will be removed. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed**
