The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '='. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the equality condition `a` is equal to `b` still holds true. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `a` is equal to `b`, and the output is '='**
