Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers as input in string format, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the numbers are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, and '>' if the first number is greater than the second. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result of the comparison. **
