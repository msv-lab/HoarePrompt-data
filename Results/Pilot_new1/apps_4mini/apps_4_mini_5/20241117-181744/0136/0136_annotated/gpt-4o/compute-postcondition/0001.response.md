The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros from it using the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `data[0]` is not specified, but since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, it will become a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros. The variable `b` remains unchanged, and `data` is still a list of substrings. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of substrings.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of substrings**
