Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer without leading zeros (or '0' if originally empty), `b` retains its original value from `data[1]`, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. There are no cases where `a` can be less than `b` due to the precondition.***
