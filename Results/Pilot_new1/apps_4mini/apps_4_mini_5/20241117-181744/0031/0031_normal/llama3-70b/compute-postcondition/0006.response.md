According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which is less than `k`, and `k` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since the values of `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 1**
