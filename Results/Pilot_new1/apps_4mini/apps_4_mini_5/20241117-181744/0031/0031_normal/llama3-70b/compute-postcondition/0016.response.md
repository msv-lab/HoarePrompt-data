The code `denominator //= gcd` performs an integer division of `denominator` by `gcd`, where `gcd` is either 2 or 8 depending on the value of `k`. The specific value of `denominator` is unknown, but it will be updated based on the division by `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` is not provided, so we cannot specify the new value after the operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `denominator` is divided by `gcd`.

Output State: **`denominator` is divided by `gcd`, where `gcd` is either 2 or 8.**
