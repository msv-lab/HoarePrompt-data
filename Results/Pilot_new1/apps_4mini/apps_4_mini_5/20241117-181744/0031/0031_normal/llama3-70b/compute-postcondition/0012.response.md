According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 3. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 8, `i` is 3**
