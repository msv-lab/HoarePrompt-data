The code assigns the value of `total_days` to be `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2^n`. The previous value of `k` is not directly affected by this assignment, and the state of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `total_days` is now calculated based on the value of `n`. 

If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the program would print (1, 1) and return, but since we are not considering that action here, we focus solely on the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n**
