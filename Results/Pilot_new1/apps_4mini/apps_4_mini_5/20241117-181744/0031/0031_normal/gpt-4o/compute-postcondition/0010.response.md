The `denominator` is assigned the value of `denominator * total_days % MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is \(2^n\). Therefore, the new value of `denominator` will be \(1 * 2^n \mod MOD\), which is \(2^n \mod MOD\).

Since the other variables (`n`, `k`, `total_days`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is \(2^n \mod MOD\), `denominator` is \(2^n \mod MOD\), `i` is 0**
