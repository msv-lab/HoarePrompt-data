To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`
- `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`
- `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`
- `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`
- `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`
- `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`
- `B` is now updated to `B // g`

The code snippet is:
```
print(A % MOD, B % MOD)
```

Now let's break down the impact of the code:
1. The values of `A` and `B` are calculated based on the initial assignments and updates.
2. The `print` statement outputs the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.
3. The values of `A` and `B` are not changed by the print statement itself.

Since we do not have specific values for `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total and updated to B // g; print outputs (A % MOD, B % MOD)**
