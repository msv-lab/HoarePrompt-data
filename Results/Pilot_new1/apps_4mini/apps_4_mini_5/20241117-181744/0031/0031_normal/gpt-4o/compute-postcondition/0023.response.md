The variable `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`. The previous value of `p_total` is known, as it was assigned the value of `denominator`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.**
