The code prints the values `1` and `1`. The initial states of `n`, `k`, and `MOD` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of those variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the printed output is 1, 1**
