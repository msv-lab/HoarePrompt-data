The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` will be a large integer representing 2 raised to the power of `n`. The value of `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `k`, and the computed value of `total_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
