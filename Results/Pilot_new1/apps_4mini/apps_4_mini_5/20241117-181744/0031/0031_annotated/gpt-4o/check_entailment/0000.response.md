To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to compute the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` days in a year. The output should be an irreducible fraction `A/B` such that `gcd(A, B) = 1`, and both `A` and `B` should be printed modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The annotations confirm that it handles the case when `b` is zero correctly.

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The first condition checks if `k > 2^n`. If true, it prints `(1, 1)` and returns. This is correct because if there are more people than days, there must be at least one shared birthday.
   - The loop calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability of no shared birthdays. The logic seems correct as it iterates `k` times, reducing the number of available days for each additional person.
   - The probability of shared birthdays is calculated as `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
   - The GCD is computed and the values are reduced accordingly.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. **When `k > 2^n`**: The program correctly handles this case by returning `(1, 1)`. However, the problem states that `A` and `B` must be coprime before taking modulo. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the output `(1, 1)` is indeed coprime, satisfying the requirement.

2. **When `k <= 2^n`**: The loop calculates the numerator and denominator correctly, but we need to ensure that the resulting `A` and `B` are coprime after the modulo operation. The annotations do not explicitly state that the reduction of `A` and `B` is valid under modulo conditions, which could be problematic. The reduction should ensure that the GCD is calculated before applying the modulo operation.

3. **Large Values of `n` and `k`**: The code handles large values of `n` (up to \(10^{18}\)) and `k` (up to \(10^{18}\)) within Python's integer limits, but the calculations involving powers of two and large products could lead to performance or overflow issues if not handled correctly.

### Conclusion
The code appears to handle the basic requirements of the problem, but lacks explicit handling of the coprimality condition after applying the modulo operation. This could lead to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios where the GCD calculation does not yield the correct coprime values after modulo reduction.

Thus, while the program handles many cases correctly, it does not guarantee correctness for all potential inputs due to the potential issue with the coprimality after modulo operation.

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Failure
For instance, if `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program should output `1 2` (since the probability is \( \frac{1}{2} \)), but if the GCD is not handled correctly after modulo, it could output something incorrect. This demonstrates that the program does not meet the problem's requirements in every potential case.
