According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the current value plus 1, meaning that `i` is now one more than its value at the start of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`.

If `i` is currently equal to its previous value plus 1, then we need to adjust it back to its previous value (which is `i - 1`) for the loop to execute again. The value of `k` does not change.

State: **`denominator` is updated based on its previous value, `i` is equal to the previous value, `k` is unchanged, and `numerator` remains updated to `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD**
