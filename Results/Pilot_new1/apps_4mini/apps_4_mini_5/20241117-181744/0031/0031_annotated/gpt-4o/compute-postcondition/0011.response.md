According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, but we do not know its exact value from the provided information. We need to adjust `i` to reflect that it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

Since `i` is in the range of `k`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `k` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we can adjust `i` to `i` is equal to the current value plus 1. Additionally, we don't have information about `k`, but we must ensure it remains unchanged.

State: **`denominator` is multiplied by 2 and taken modulo `MOD`, `i` is equal to the current value plus 1, `k` is unchanged**
