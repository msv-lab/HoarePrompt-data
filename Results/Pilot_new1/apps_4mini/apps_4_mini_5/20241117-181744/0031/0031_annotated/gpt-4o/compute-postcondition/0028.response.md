The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, with `n` constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and `k` constrained such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). If `k` is greater than \(2\) raised to the power of `n`, the function prints the tuple (1, 1) and does not return any value. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2\) raised to the power of `n`, there is no output or return value specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` exceeds \(2^n\), it prints (1, 1) and does not return anything. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), there is no output or return value.**
