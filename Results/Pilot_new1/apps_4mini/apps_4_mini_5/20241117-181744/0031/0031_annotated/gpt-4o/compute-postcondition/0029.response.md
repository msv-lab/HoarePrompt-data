Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), it calculates a fraction based on combinatorial probabilities, reducing the result by the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator, and prints the reduced values modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If the input conditions are met, and `k` is not greater than \(2^n\), there is no explicit return value, and the function ends without outputting anything in that case. **
