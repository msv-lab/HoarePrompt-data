To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the potential edge cases.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function `func_1(n, k)` calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday among `2^n` days for `k` people.
2. It computes the numerator and denominator of the probability by iterating `k` times:
   - The numerator is calculated by multiplying `(total_days - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
   - The denominator is simply `total_days` raised to the power of `k`.
3. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator is computed to reduce the fraction to its irreducible form.
4. Finally, both the numerator and denominator are returned modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `k > total_days`:**
   - If `k` is greater than `2^n`, then by the pigeonhole principle, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. In this case, the expected output should be `A = 1` and `B = 1`. However, the current implementation does not handle this case explicitly. If `k` exceeds `total_days`, the numerator will still be computed based on the loop, which may not yield the correct result.
   
2. **Large Values of `n` and `k`:**
   - The limits are `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. This means that `total_days` can be extremely large (up to `2^10^18`), which can lead to overflow issues in practical programming languages. Python handles large integers, but the multiplication in the loop could still result in very large numbers that could be inefficient to compute.

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The gcd is calculated between the numerator and denominator, but if the denominator is `0` (which it shouldn't be in this context), it could lead to a division error.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential case where `k > total_days`, the program does not correctly handle this situation and will not return the expected output of `1 1`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
