To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider various edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**: Two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`.
2. **Days Calculation**: The total number of days is `2^n`.
3. **Output**: The probability that at least two people have the same birthday expressed as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, printed modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Code Analysis
- The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) to simplify the fraction.
- The function `func_2` handles the main logic:
  - If `k > 2^n`, it immediately returns `1 1` since it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday.
  - It calculates the number of favorable outcomes (`numerator`) and total outcomes (`denominator`).
  - It computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday and reduces the fraction to its simplest form.

### Edge Cases
1. **Maximum Values**: Consider `n = 10^18` and `k = 2`. The total days would be `2^(10^18)`, which is impractical to compute directly due to size. However, since `k` is much smaller than `2^n`, the logic should still hold.
2. **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output should be `1 2` because there are 2 days and 2 people, leading to a chance of shared birthdays.
3. **Guaranteed Shared Birthdays**: For `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the output is `1 1` since there are only 2 days and 3 people.
4. **Large k**: If `k` is very large but still less than `2^n`, it should compute correctly without overflow issues.

### Potential Failure Case
The code does not handle the case when `k > total_days` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` exceeds the number of days, the output should be `1 1`. However, if the input is `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the program correctly identifies that there are 2 days and outputs the correct probability as `1 2`, but it does not account for cases where `k` becomes larger than `total_days` in a more nuanced way.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly compute the probability for all potential cases, especially when `k` is larger than `total_days`. This leads to incorrect outputs in some scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of Failure**: When `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the expected output is `1 1`, but the program will not handle the input correctly as it does not account for the fact that the number of people exceeds the number of days.
