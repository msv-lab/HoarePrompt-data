According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, which means that `k` must be greater than 3. 

Since `k` is at least 2, it is possible for `k` to be greater than 3, so we need to adjust it accordingly. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 3 and `k` to be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 2), `denominator` is 2^(3n), `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 3**
