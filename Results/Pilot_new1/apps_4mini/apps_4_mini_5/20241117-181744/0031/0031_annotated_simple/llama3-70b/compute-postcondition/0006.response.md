According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `k` must be at least 1 (since `i` must be less than `k`).

The states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be adjusted to 1 to reflect the next iteration.
- `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 1, `k` is at least 1**
