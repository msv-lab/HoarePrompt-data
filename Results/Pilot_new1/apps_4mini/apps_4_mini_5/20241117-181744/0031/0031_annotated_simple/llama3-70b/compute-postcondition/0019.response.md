Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the total number of days as `2 ** n`, then computes the numerator as the product of the first `k` terms from `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)`, and the denominator as `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the numerator and denominator remain 1. Finally, it returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator when divided by `1000003`. **
