The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function body, it returns the remainder of `numerator` when divided by 1000003 and the remainder of `denominator` when divided by 1000003. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the remainders of 'numerator' and 'denominator' when divided by 1000003. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, and returns the remainder of 'numerator' when divided by 1000003 and the remainder of 'denominator' when divided by 1000003.**
