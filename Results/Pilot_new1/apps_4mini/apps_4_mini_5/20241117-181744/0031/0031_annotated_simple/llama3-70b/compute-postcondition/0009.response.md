According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `k` must be greater than 2 to ensure that the loop can continue.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n * (2^n - 1), `denominator` is 2^(2n), `i` is 2, `k` is at least 2**
