The value of `A` is updated by performing integer division with `g`. The values of `A` and `B` are `p_shared` and `p_total`, respectively, and `g` is the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`. Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `g` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific new value of `A`. However, we can state that `A` is now the result of `A // g`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A` has been modified based on the division, while the values of `B` and `g` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is modified to `A // g`, `B` is equal to `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the value returned by func_1(A, B)**
