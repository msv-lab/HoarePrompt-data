Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), it prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from a total of \(2^n\) items without shared choices, computes the corresponding values, and prints the reduced fraction of shared to total choices modulo \(10^6 + 3\). The function does not return any value. **
