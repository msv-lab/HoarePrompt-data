The variable `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The initial state indicates that `p_shared` is calculated based on the values of `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, and `MOD`, but the specific value of `p_shared` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A` is now equal to `p_shared`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`A` is equal to `p_shared`**
