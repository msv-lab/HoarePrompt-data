According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `i` must still be less than `k`. Therefore, `k` needs to be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing. 

No other states need to be adjusted as they remain the same regardless of the loop iterations.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is updated to \(\left((2^n) \% MOD \cdot (2^n - 1)\right) \% MOD\), `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^n) % MOD`, `i` is 2**
