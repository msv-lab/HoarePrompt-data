The code assigns the value `10 ** 6 + 3` to the variable `MOD`. This operation does not change the values of `n` and `k`, which remain as integers within their specified ranges. Therefore, after executing the code, `MOD` will have a specific value while `n` and `k` retain their initial states.

Calculating `MOD` gives:

```
MOD = 10 ** 6 + 3 = 1000003
```

Thus, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003**
