To analyze the provided code snippet, we note that `A` has been modified to `A // g`, and `B` is now `p_total // g`. The value of `g` is obtained from the return of the function `func_1(A, B)`. 

The code `print(A % MOD, B % MOD)` will compute the modulus of the modified values of `A` and `B` with respect to `MOD`. 

Since the specific values of `A`, `B`, `MOD`, and `g` are not provided, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`A` is modified to `A // g`, `B` is now `p_total // g`, and the output is (A % MOD, B % MOD)**.
