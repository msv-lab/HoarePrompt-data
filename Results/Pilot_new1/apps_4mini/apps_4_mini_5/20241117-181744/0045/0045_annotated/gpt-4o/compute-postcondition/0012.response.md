The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is not specified, but it is known that it is a result of the calculation `n - d * min_sum`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and `d` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
