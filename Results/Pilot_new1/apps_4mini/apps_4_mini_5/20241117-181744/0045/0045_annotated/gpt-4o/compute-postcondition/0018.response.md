According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `i` at `k - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 2` (since `i` is decremented by 1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1` (the starting point of the loop). Additionally, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0, so no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, and `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`**
