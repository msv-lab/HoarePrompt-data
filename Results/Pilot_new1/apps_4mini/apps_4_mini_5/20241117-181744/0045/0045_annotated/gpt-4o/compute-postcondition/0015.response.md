Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 for `i` equal to `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing beyond this point.***
