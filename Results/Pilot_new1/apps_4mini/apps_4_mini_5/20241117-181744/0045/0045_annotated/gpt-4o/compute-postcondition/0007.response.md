According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means that for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`. Given that `n` and `k` are both positive integers, we can conclude that `k` is already greater than `0`. 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` will start at `k - 1`. Therefore, we need to specify the initial values of `i`, `k`, and any other relevant states. 

Since `k` is a positive integer, it can be at least `1`, and thus `i` will be `k - 1`, which is `0` or greater.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd], `i` is k - 1**
