To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the conditions under which the loop will run.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it starts at `i = k - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`. 
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. 
3. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be decremented to `k - 2` in the next iteration.

Since the loop iterates in reverse, the next value of `i` will be `k - 2`, which is still valid as long as `k` is greater than or equal to `2`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` do not affect the loop's execution directly in this context.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should reflect that `i` is now `k - 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
