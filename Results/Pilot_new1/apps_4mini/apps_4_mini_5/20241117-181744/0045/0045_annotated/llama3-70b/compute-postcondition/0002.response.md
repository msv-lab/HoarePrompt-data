The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, with `a` being assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` being assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, `a % b` will yield a positive remainder. The state of `n` and `k` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is positive, `k` is positive, `a` is not a multiple of `b`, and after the operation, `a` is the previous value of `b`, and `b` is the positive remainder of `a % b`.

Output State: **`n` is positive, `k` is positive, `a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the positive remainder of `a % b`**
