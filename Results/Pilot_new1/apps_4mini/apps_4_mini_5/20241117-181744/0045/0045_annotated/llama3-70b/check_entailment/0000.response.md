To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements and the code annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input**: Two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \).
2. **Output**: A strictly increasing sequence of \( k \) positive integers such that:
   - Their sum equals \( n \).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized.
3. If no such sequence exists, output -1.

### Annotations Overview:
The provided code snippet is a function that calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it does not seem to directly relate to the problem of generating a sequence of integers that meet the above criteria. The annotations describe the behavior of the GCD function but do not address the requirements of the problem.

### Analysis:
1. **Strictly Increasing Sequence**: The program must generate \( k \) integers that are strictly increasing and whose sum is \( n \). If \( k \) is greater than \( n \), it is impossible to have \( k \) positive integers that sum to \( n \), and the output should be -1. For example, for \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \), the output should be -1, which is correctly noted in the examples.
  
2. **Maximized GCD**: The program must also ensure that the GCD of the sequence is maximized. This is not addressed in the GCD function provided. The GCD is crucial for determining the sequence, and the function does not create or return any sequence at all.

3. **Example Cases**: The examples given in the problem statement (such as \( n = 6, k = 3 \) yielding \( 1, 2, 3 \)) indicate a requirement for the program to generate specific sequences. The provided code does not implement this logic and is limited to calculating the GCD of two numbers.

### Conclusion:
The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, as it does not generate the required sequence of integers, nor does it handle the output according to the rules specified. The GCD function is unrelated to the task of creating the sequence. This leads us to conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails because it does not implement the logic to find a strictly increasing sequence of \( k \) positive integers that sum to \( n \) and maximize their GCD, as required by the problem description.
