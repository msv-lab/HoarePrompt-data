The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both parameters are positive integers. Since the output indicates that the initial value of `b`, which is 0 at the start, is returned and the loop doesn't execute, it implies that the function effectively returns the value of `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the initial value of `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers, and returns the initial value of `b`.**
