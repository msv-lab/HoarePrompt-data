According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means it will execute `k` times as long as `k` is greater than `0`. Given that `k` is a positive integer, the loop can execute without any adjustments needed for `k`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to `k - 1` for the first iteration. Since `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` are already defined and calculated, they do not need any modifications for the loop to execute.

Thus, the relevant states to reflect before the loop starts are:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer
- `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`
- `d` is `n // min_sum`
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`
- `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`
- `i` is `k - 1`

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, `sequence` is [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd], `i` is k - 1**
