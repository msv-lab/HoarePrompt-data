Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 1`, `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + 1]`, and `i` is `k - 2`. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution without breaking. This ensures that the loop will terminate when the remainder is exactly 0, which indicates that `n` is perfectly divisible by `min_sum`.***
