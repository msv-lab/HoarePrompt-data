The variable `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` was `n - d * min_sum - 2`, so after executing the code, `remainder` becomes `n - d * min_sum - 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is now `n - d * min_sum - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.
