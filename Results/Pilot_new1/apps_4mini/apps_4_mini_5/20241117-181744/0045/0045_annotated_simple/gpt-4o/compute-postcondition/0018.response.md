According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `k - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for `i`. Since `i` is currently `k - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 3`, which means `k - 2` must be at least `0`. Therefore, we need to adjust `k` to ensure that `k - 2` is `0` or greater.

Since `k` is a positive integer, `k` must be at least `2` for `i` to be `0` or greater. Thus, if `k` is currently `2`, `i` will be `0` in the next iteration. However, if `k` is greater than `2`, `i` will decrement to the next lower value.

Consequently, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must remain a positive integer, but it should be at least `2` to ensure that `i` can decrement to `k - 3` (which will be `-1` if `k` is `2`).
- `i` should be adjusted to `k - 3` to reflect the next iteration.

Thus, the updated state should be:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is now `n - d * min_sum - 2`, `sequence` is modified at index `i` (which is `k - 3`) by incrementing it by 1, and `i` is `k - 3`**
