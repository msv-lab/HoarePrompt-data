The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum required sum (`min_sum`) to create a sequence of `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, it calculates how many complete sets of this minimum sum can be formed (`d`) and the remaining value after forming these sets (`remainder`). It then constructs a sequence of `k` integers based on `d`, and if there is any remainder, it increments the last elements of the sequence until the remainder is exhausted. The function ultimately returns this modified sequence.
