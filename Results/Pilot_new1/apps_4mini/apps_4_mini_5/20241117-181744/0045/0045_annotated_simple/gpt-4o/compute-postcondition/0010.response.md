Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, and `i` is `k - 1`. If `remainder` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that `n` is perfectly divisible by `min_sum`. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues executing without breaking.***
