The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are known, where `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2` and `d` is `n // min_sum`. Therefore, `remainder` is calculated based on these values. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is n // min_sum, and `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum**
