To calculate `min_sum`, we use the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range specified (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10), the value of `min_sum` will depend on the specific value of `k`. However, since the exact value of `k` is not provided, we can only express `min_sum` in terms of `k`.

The output state will reflect that `min_sum` is calculated based on the value of `k`:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
