To determine the output state, we analyze the impact of the code snippet provided. 

The code initializes a list called `sequence` using a list comprehension. It iterates over a range from `0` to `k-1` (inclusive), where `i` takes on values from `0` to `k-1`. During each iteration, the expression `d * (i + 1)` is calculated and stored in the list.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is `n // min_sum`, which is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`.
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, giving the remaining value after accounting for `d` full sets of the minimum sum.

The list comprehension creates a sequence where:
- For `i = 0`, the value is `d * (0 + 1) = d * 1 = d`.
- For `i = 1`, the value is `d * (1 + 1) = d * 2`.
- For `i = 2`, the value is `d * (2 + 1) = d * 3`.
- ...
- For `i = k-1`, the value is `d * (k)`.

Thus, the `sequence` list will contain the first `k` multiples of `d`:
- `sequence = [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, and `sequence` is [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]**.
