To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description:
1. You are given two positive integers, `n` and `k`.
2. You need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n`.
3. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
4. If no such sequence exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2  # Minimum sum of the first k positive integers
    if min_sum > n:  # If the minimum sum is greater than n, return -1
        return -1
    d = n // min_sum  # Calculate the maximum divisor
    remainder = n - d * min_sum  # Calculate the remaining sum after using d
    sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]  # Create the sequence with the maximum divisor
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):  # Distribute the remainder
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        sequence[i] += 1
        remainder -= 1
    return sequence

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, k)
if result == -1:
    print(-1)
else:
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Key Points:
- The code first calculates the minimum sum required to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it correctly returns `-1` as it's impossible to form such a sequence.
- The code then calculates the maximum possible divisor `d` and constructs an initial sequence based on that.
- The remainder is distributed to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Case when n is exactly the minimum sum**: For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the minimum sum is `3` (the sequence is `[1, 2]`).
2. **Case when k is 1**: If `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the output should be `[5]` which is valid.
3. **Case when k is larger than n**: For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the output should be `-1` since we cannot form two positive integers that sum to 1.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6`, so the output is `-1`, which is correct.
- For `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is `6`, and the sequence generated is `[1, 2, 7]`, which sums to `10` and has a GCD of `1`. However, a better sequence could be `[2, 3, 5]`, which also sums to `10` but has a GCD of `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program finds valid sequences for valid inputs and returns `-1` when it's impossible to form such a sequence. However, it does not ensure that the GCD is maximized in all scenarios, as seen in the case where `n = 10` and `k = 3`. 

Thus, the program is not guaranteed to find the sequence with the maximum GCD in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
