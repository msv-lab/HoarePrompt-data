To analyze the given program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If it's not possible to create such a sequence, the output should be `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

### Code Breakdown:
1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct because we cannot have `k` positive integers sum to `n` if `n` is smaller than `k`.
2. It initializes an empty list `seq` and attempts to fill it with the first `k` positive integers (`1, 2, ..., k`).
3. It subtracts each integer from `n` as it adds it to the sequence.
4. If the length of `seq` is not equal to `k` after the loop, it prints `-1`.
5. If the sequence is valid, it prints the sequence.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not consider the requirement for the GCD to be maximal. It only constructs the sequence by sequentially adding the smallest integers, which may not yield the maximal GCD.
- For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program would output `1 2 3` (GCD = 1), but a valid sequence with a maximal GCD could be `2 4 6` (GCD = 2) which also sums to `12`.
- The program also does not handle cases where a valid sequence could exist but isn't constructed because it only checks for the first `k` integers.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not ensure the GCD of the sequence is maximal, and it fails to explore other valid sequences that could yield a larger GCD.

Correctness: **False**.
