The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum required sum `min_sum` as the sum of the first `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that it is not possible to form the required sum. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates how many complete sets of the minimum sum can be formed and distributes any remaining value to the last elements of a list `sequence`, which initially contains the multiples of the complete sets. The function returns the modified list `sequence`.
