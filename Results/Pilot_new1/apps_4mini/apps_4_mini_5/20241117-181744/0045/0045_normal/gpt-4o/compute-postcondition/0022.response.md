The `remainder` variable is decreased by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is not specified, but since it is a positive integer, the new value of `remainder` will still be a positive integer as long as it is greater than 1. The other variables `n`, `k`, `sequence`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
