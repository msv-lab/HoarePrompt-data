The value of `sequence[i]` is increased by 1. The value of `i` is `k - 2`, so `sequence[k - 2]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables, `n`, `k`, `sequence[k - 1]`, and `remainder`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `sequence[k - 1]` is increased by 1, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
