The code assigns the value of `min_sum` to the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The specific values of `n` and `k` are not provided, but we know that `k` is a positive integer within the range specified. Therefore, the value of `min_sum` will depend on the value of `k`. 

The calculation for `min_sum` will yield a specific integer based on the value of `k`. The output state will reflect that `min_sum` has been calculated based on `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
