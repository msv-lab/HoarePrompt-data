Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99 and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place for `n` (i.e., `tens[n // 10]`). If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`, covering all cases including 10, 20, ..., 90 for multiples of 10 and 11, 12, ..., 99 for other values of `n`. If `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not execute the if statement and no output is produced.***
