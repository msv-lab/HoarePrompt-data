The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. The function handles different cases based on the value of `n`: 

- If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list.
- If `n` is equal to 10 or a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, it returns a string representation of `n` in the format of 'tens' followed by '-' and 'ones'.
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 'zero'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation based on specified conditions, ensuring all valid integers from 0 to 99 are correctly represented. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns the string representation of n based on its value, including specific strings for numbers 0-9, 10, multiples of 10, and numbers 11-19, while formatting the output appropriately for numbers between 10 and 99.**
