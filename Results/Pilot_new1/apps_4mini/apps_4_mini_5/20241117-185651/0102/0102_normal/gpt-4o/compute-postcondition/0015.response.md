Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 11 or `n` is greater than 19. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive, and if `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list (e.g., 'ten', 'twenty', ..., 'ninety'). If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string representation of `n` in the format of 'tens' followed by '-' and 'ones', ensuring that all valid integers from 10 to 99 are correctly represented. For any other values of `n`, no output is generated.***
