Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is equal to 10 or a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, it returns a string representation of `n` in the format of 'tens' followed by '-' and 'ones', ensuring that all valid integers from 0 to 99 are correctly represented. If `n` is 0, the function returns 'zero'.*
