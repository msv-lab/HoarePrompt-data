Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 10 and 99 inclusive. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list, which represents `n` as a multiple of ten (i.e., 'ten', 'twenty', ..., 'ninety'). If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format of 'tens' followed by '-' and 'ones', where 'tens' corresponds to the tens place of `n` and 'ones' corresponds to the ones place of `n`, ensuring that all valid integers from 10 to 99 are correctly represented.***
