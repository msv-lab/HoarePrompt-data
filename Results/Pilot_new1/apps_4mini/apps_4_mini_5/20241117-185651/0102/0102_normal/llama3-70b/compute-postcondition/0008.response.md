The variable `s` is an integer between 10 and 19 (inclusive). The expression `teens[s - 10]` accesses the `teens` list at the index corresponding to `s - 10`. Since `s` is between 10 and 19, `s - 10` will yield values from 0 to 9, which correspond to the indices of the `teens` list.

The output of the print statement will be the string representation of the number corresponding to `s`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the value of `s` and the string representation printed from the `teens` list.

Output State: **`s` is an integer between 10 and 19; the printed value is the string representation of `s` from the `teens` list.**
