Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99 and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place corresponding to `n` from the `tens` list. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string formatted as "tens-ones", where `tens` is derived from the `tens` list and `ones` is derived from the `ones` list based on the value of `n`. Additionally, if `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not execute the if block, and no string representation is returned.***
