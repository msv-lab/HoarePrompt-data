To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code in relation to the problem description, which requires converting an integer score (between 0 and 99) into its English word representation.

The relevant parts of the program are as follows:

1. **Data Structures**: 
   - `ones`: A list containing the English words for numbers 0 to 9.
   - `teens`: A list for numbers 11 to 19 (note that 'ten' is not included here).
   - `tens`: A list for multiples of ten from 10 to 90.

2. **Logic**:
   - The function first checks if the number `n` is between 0 and 9. If true, it returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
   - If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from the `teens` list.
   - If `n` is between 10 and 99, it checks if `n` is a multiple of ten. If it is, it returns the word from the `tens` list; if not, it combines the appropriate words from the `tens` and `ones` lists with a hyphen.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles numbers from 0 to 9.
   - It handles the teens (11-19) correctly, but note that it does not handle 'ten' (10) specifically in the teens section, which is appropriate since 'ten' is in the `tens` list.
   - For numbers ending in zero between 10 and 90, it returns the correct representation.
   - For numbers between 21 and 99 that are not multiples of ten, it correctly formats the output as "tens-ones".

### Analysis of Potential Issues:
The provided code seems to handle all specified cases correctly as per the problem description. The only potential concern could be the handling of the number 10, but it is correctly returned as 'ten' from the `tens` list.

### Conclusion:
Since the program correctly translates all numbers from 0 to 99 into their English word representations according to the problem's requirements, I find no faults or missed edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
