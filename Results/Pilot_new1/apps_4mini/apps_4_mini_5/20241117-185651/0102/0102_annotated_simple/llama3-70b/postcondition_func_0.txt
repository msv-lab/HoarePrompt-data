The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `s` from the user, which is expected to be in the range of 0 to 99. It prints the English word representation of `s`: if `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list; if `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list; if `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation by combining the appropriate entry from the `tens` list with the `ones` list, using a hyphen if `s` is not a multiple of 10. However, there is no handling for cases where `s` is less than 0 or greater than 99, which could lead to an IndexError. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.
