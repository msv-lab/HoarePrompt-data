The code assigns the value of `dist3` to be the absolute difference between `0` and `min_pos`. However, the value of `min_pos` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific value of `dist3`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`, `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos), and `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos).

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is `max_pos`, `dist2` is calculated as abs(n - 1 - max_pos), and `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos)**
