Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each integer in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list, computes the maximum and minimum distances between them, and prints the maximum of these distances adjusted by the length of the list. The function does not handle cases where `1` or `n` is not present in the list, which could lead to a ValueError. **
