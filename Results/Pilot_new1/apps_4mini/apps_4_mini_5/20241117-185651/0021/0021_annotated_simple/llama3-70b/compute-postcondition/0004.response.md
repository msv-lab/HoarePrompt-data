To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the initial state of the variables.

1. `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
2. `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input.
3. `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`.
4. `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`.

The code calculates `max_dist` using the formula:
```
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
```

- `abs(pos1 - posn)` computes the absolute difference between the indices of `1` and `n` in the list `a`.
- `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` adjusts this difference by subtracting 1.
- `n - 2` calculates the maximum possible distance between any two elements in the list considering the length of the list.
- The `max()` function then takes the maximum of these two computed values.

Since `pos1` and `posn` are derived from the list `a`, which is based on user input, their specific values are not known, but they will determine the value of `max_dist`.

The output state will reflect the computed value of `max_dist` alongside the existing known states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a; `max_dist` is computed as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
