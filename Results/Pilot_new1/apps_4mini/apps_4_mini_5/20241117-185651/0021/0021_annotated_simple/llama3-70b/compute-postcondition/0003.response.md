The code assigns the value of `posn` to be the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input, we need to consider that `n` must be one of the integers in `a`. Therefore, `posn` will be assigned the index of `n` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a.**
