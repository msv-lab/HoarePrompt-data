To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state includes:
   - `n`: an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100
   - `a`: a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input
   - `pos1`: the index of `1` in `a`
   - `posn`: the index of `n` in `a`
   - `min_dist`: computed as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`

2. The code snippet `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))` does the following:
   - It uses the variable `max_dist`, which is not defined in the initial state provided. Therefore, we cannot determine its value.
   - It calculates `n - 1 - min_dist`, where `n` and `min_dist` are known.

3. Since `max_dist` is undefined, we cannot compute `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` without knowing the value of `max_dist`.

Thus, the output state reflects that we do not have sufficient information to compute the result due to the undefined variable `max_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `min_dist` is computed as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `max_dist` is undefined.**
