Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap. 

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, the minimum element (1) is at index 0, and the maximum element (5) is at index 4. The current distance between them is 4. 

The program calculates the distances to the ends of the array:
- `dist1 = abs(0 - 4) = 4` (from min_pos to max_pos)
- `dist2 = abs(4 - 4) = 0` (from max_pos to the last position)
- `dist3 = abs(0 - 0) = 0` (from min_pos to the first position)
- `dist4 = abs(4 - 0) = 4` (from max_pos to the first position)

The maximum distance computed by the program is `max_distance = max(4, 0, 0, 4) = 4`, which does not account for performing a swap to achieve a greater distance. 

However, if we swap 1 and 5, the array becomes:
```
5 2 3 4 1
```
Now the distance between 1 and 5 is `4` (from index 0 to index 4), which is already the maximum possible distance. 

Thus, the program fails to consider the actual swap operation and does not correctly maximize the distance as required by the problem statement. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
