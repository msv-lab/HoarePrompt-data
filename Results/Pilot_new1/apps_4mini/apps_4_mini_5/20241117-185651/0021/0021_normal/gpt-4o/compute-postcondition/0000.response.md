The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), the value of `n` will be updated to the input integer within that range. The list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n**
