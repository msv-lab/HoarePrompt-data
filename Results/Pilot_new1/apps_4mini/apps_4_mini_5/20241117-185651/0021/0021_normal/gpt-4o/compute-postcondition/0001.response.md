The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes input as a string, splits it into components, converts each component to an integer, and then creates a list of those integers. Since `a` is initially a list of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`, the new value of `a` will depend on the input provided. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` is now a list of integers based on the input provided.**
