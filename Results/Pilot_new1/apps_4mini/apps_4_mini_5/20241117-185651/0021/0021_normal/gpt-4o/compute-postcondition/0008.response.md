To determine the output state, we first analyze the variables involved:

1. `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`.
2. `dist2` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.
3. `dist3` is calculated as `abs(0 - min_pos)`, where `min_pos` is assumed to be defined elsewhere.
4. `dist4` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - min_pos`, where `min_pos` is again assumed to be defined elsewhere.

The code `max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)` computes the maximum value among these four distances.

Since we do not have specific values for `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Therefore, the output state will summarize the relationship between these variables and their maximum value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers based on the input provided, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos), `dist3` is abs(0 - min_pos), `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos), and `max_distance` is the maximum of (dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)**.
