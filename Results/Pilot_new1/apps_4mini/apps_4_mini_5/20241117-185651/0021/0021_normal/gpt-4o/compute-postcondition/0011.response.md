Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (which must be between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the first occurrence of the integer 1 and the integer `n` to the start (index 0) and end (index n-1) of the list. The maximum of these distances is then printed. The function does not handle cases where the input does not satisfy the expected conditions (e.g., if `1` or `n` is not present in the list). **
