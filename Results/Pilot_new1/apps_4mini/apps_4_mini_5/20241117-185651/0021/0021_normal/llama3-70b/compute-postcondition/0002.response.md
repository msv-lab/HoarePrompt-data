The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The value of `n` does not affect the execution of this line directly, and the state of `a` is determined by user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the value of `pos1` based on the contents of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from user input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`**
