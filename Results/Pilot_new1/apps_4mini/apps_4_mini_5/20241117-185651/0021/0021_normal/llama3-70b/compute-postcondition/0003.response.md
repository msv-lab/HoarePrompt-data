The code `posn = a.index(n)` assigns to `posn` the index of the first occurrence of the integer `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is within the range of 2 to 100, and `a` is a list of integers provided by user input. The state of the variable `pos1` is not affected by this operation. 

The output state will reflect the fact that `posn` is now assigned the index of `n` in `a`, but we cannot determine the exact value of `posn` without knowing the contents of `a`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the relationship without specifying exact values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from user input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
