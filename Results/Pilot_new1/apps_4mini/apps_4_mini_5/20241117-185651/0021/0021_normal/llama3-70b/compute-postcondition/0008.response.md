Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` (which is a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and n in the list and the distance to the nearest edge of the list. The function then prints the maximum of these distances. It assumes valid input and does not handle potential errors such as the absence of 1 or n in the list, which would raise a ValueError. **
