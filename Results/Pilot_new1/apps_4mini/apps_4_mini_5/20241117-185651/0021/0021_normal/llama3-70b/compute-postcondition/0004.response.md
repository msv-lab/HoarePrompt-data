To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. The code calculates `max_dist` using the formula: `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
2. The variables `pos1` and `posn` are the indices of the first occurrences of `1` and `n` in the list `a`, respectively. Their specific values are not provided, but we know they are valid indices within the bounds of the list.
3. The value of `n` is given to be an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, which means `n - 2` will always be non-negative and can range from `0` to `98`.
4. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` calculates the absolute distance between the two indices and subtracts `1`. This value can be negative if `pos1` and `posn` are adjacent or equal.
5. The final result for `max_dist` will be the maximum of the two calculated values.

Since we do not have specific values for `pos1` and `posn`, we can only describe the potential outcomes based on the relationships between these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from user input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `max_dist` is the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (n - 2)**
