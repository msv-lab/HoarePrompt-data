The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` (which is a permutation of integers from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and n in the list, considering the distance to the ends of the list. The function prints the maximum of this calculated distance and the distance from the first position to the second last position in the list. However, the function does not return any value; it solely prints the result.
