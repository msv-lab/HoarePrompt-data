The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `a`. The integer `n` must satisfy the constraint that it is between 2 and 100, inclusive. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers that form a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`. 

The function does not explicitly return a value in the provided output. Therefore, we can infer that it may perform some operations or calculations based on the input parameters, but the exact return value or behavior is not specified. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` (a permutation of integers from 1 to n), but the return value or output behavior is not specified.**
