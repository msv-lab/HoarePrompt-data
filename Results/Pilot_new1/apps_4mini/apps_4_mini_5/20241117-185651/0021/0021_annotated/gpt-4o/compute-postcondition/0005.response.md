The variable `dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The values of `n` and `max_pos` are known from the initial state. `n` is an input integer, and `max_pos` is the index of the value `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, the calculation for `dist2` will depend on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`.

Since `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, it does not affect the calculation of `dist2`. The final output state includes the updated value of `dist2`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the value 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`, and `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**.
