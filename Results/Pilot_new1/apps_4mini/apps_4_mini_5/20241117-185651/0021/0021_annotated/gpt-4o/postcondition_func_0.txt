The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and n), and calculates the maximum distance from either end of the list to the positions of the integers 1 and `n`. It then prints this maximum distance. The function does not handle cases where the input does not meet the specified constraints (e.g., if `1` or `n` is not present in the list).
