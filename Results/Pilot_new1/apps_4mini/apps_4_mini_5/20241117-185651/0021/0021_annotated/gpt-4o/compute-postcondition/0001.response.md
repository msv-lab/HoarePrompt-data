The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into components. The input consists of `n` distinct integers, which means the list `a` will contain exactly `n` integers. The previous value of `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 100, and it is updated based on the input integer. Therefore, the output state reflects the new list `a` containing the input integers and the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is updated to the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers**
