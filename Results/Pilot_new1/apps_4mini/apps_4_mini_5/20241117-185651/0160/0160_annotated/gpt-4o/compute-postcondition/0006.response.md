According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The condition for the loop to run again is that `int(math.sqrt(x))` must be at least 2, which implies that `x` must be at least 4 (since the square root of 4 is 2).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 2.
- The condition for `x` must be adjusted to ensure that it is at least 4.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is an empty set or contains the elements {1, x // 1} if `x` is divisible by 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2**
