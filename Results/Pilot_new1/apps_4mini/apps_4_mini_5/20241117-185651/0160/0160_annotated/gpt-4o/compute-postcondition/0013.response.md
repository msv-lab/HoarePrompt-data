Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, and `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6. If `x` is divisible by 3, the `divisors` set includes 3 and the result of `x // 3`. If `x` is not divisible by 3, the `divisors` set remains unchanged, retaining its initial state as either empty or containing elements based on previous operations.***
