Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` is an empty set or contains the elements {1, x // 1} if `x` is divisible by 1, `x` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are added to `divisors`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the contents of `divisors` remain unchanged.***
