According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop iterates from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be at least 1. Given that `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^9\), we can assume that `x` could potentially be equal to `K` or any other relevant value derived from the state. 

Since `K` is non-negative, we need to ensure that `K` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, the loop variable `i` starts at 1. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the states to ensure `K` is at least 1 and set `i` to 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of N integers, each between 1 and 10^6; `divisors` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
