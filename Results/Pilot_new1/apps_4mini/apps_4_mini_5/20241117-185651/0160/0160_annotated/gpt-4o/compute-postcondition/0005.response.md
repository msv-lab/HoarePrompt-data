Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is an empty set or contains the elements {1, x // i} if `x` is divisible by `i` (where `i` is 1). If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set `divisors` remains empty.***
