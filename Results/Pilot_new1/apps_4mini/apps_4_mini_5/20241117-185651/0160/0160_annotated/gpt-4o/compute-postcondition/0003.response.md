The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is given as 1, the set `divisors` will now contain the value 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is now {1}, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that `x` is divisible by `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is greater than or equal to 1, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is now {1}, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that `x` is divisible by `i`**
