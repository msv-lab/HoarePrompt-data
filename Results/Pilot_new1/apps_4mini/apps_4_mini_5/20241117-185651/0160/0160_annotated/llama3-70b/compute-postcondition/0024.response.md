According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `gcd`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `3` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `gcd` is at least 9 for `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` to be 3 or greater.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `i` should be updated to 3.
- `gcd` should be adjusted to be at least 9 so that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
