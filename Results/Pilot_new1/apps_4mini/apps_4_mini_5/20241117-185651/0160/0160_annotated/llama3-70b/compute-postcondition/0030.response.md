Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` found during the loop execution, which ranges from 1 to the integer square root of `gcd`. If `gcd` is at least 1, the loop executes for values of `i` from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. If `gcd` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, the loop will execute only once, resulting in `max_divisor` being 1.**
