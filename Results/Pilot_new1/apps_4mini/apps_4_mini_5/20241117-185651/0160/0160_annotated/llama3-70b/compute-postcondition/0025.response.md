The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 3, the new value of `max_divisor` will depend on its previous value. The initial state indicates that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, but the value of `max_divisor` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_divisor`. 

The output state remains unchanged for the other variables. Thus, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 3.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and 3**
