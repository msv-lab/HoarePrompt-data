The variable `divisors` is updated by adding the value `x // i` to it. The value of `i` is determined as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and since `int(math.sqrt(x))` is at least `i`, `x // i` will be a valid integer. The initial state does not change any other variables, so the output state reflects the addition of `x // i` to the `divisors` set. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, and `divisors` now includes `x // i`.**
