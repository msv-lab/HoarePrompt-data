Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, and if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` will include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the `divisors` set remains unchanged.***
