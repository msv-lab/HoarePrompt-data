According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

Additionally, since the loop is dependent on the value of `x`, `x` must remain unchanged for the loop to execute again under the same conditions.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `x` is unchanged, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
