Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A[i] is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., the remainder when `x` is divided by `i` is 0).***
