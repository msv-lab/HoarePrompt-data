Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6. If `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i`, then `divisors` includes both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of `divisors` remains unchanged.***
