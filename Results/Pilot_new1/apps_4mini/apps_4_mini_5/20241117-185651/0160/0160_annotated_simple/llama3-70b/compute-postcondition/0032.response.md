The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. 

- `N` is an integer that must be between 2 and 500.
- `K` is a non-negative integer that must be less than or equal to 10^9.
- `A` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6.

The function does not return a value, as indicated by the absence of any output specification in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters without returning a value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N (an integer between 2 and 500), K (a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9), and A (a list of N integers each between 1 and 10^6), and does not return any value.**
