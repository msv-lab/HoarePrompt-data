The value of `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the current `gcd` and `A[i]`. The initial value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `i` is 1, which means `A[i]` corresponds to `A[1]`. Therefore, `gcd` is now the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[1]), `i` is 1**
