The variable `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` of the list `A`. The value of `i` is 3, so `A[i]` refers to the fourth element of the list `A`. The previous value of `gcd` is not explicitly provided, but it will be replaced by the result of the gcd computation. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 3 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[3]), `i` is 3**
