According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `N`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `N` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and we need to ensure that `N` is greater than 3 to allow for another iteration.

State: **`N` is greater than 3, `K` is a non-negative integer, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[2]), `i` is 3**
