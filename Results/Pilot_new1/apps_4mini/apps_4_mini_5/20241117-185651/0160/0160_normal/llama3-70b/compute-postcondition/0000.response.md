The values of `N` and `K` are assigned from the input, which is processed by the `map` function that converts the input strings to integers. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not known, as they depend on the input provided. The list `A` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the output state indicates that `N` and `K` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer based on input, `K` is a non-negative integer based on input, and `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i is between 1 and 10^6**
