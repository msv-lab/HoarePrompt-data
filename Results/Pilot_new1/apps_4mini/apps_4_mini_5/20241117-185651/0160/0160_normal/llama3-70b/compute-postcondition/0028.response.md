Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is at least 2. If `gcd % i == 0`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
