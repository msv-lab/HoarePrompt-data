The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 1 and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` will either remain the same or be updated to 1, depending on its previous value. However, the specific value of `max_divisor` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact outcome. Therefore, the output state is: `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 1.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 1.**
