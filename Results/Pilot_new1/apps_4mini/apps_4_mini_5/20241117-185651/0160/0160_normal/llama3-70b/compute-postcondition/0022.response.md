Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is either `gcd` or 2. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`, which accounts for all possible values of `i` starting from 2. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. This ensures that `max_divisor` will always be either `gcd` or a value derived from `gcd` divided by `i` when applicable.***
