The code adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. The previous state of `divisors` is not specified, but it already includes `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `divisors` will now include the additional value `i`.

Since the other variables (`N`, `K`, and `A`) are not affected, the output state reflects the updated `divisors` set.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, and `divisors` includes `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` and `i`.**
