Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x`, including both `i` and `x // i` for each `i` that divides `x`. If `x` is 1, then `divisors` will contain only 1. If `x` is less than 1 or if the loop does not execute (for example, if `x` is less than 1), then `divisors` remains an empty set. The loop will execute for all integers `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, and for each `i`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `divisors` will remain an empty set.**
