Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each `A_i` is an integer such that 1 <= `A_i` <= 10^6. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are added to the set of `divisors`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set of `divisors` remains unchanged.***
