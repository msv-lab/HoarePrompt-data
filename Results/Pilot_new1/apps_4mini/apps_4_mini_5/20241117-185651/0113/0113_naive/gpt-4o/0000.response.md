To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the program itself.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to find the k-rounding of a positive integer n, which is defined as the minimum positive integer x such that:
1. x ends with k or more zeros in base 10.
2. x is divisible by n.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program computes a `multiplier` which is `10 ** k`, representing the smallest number that ends with at least k zeros.
2. It then calculates `x` using the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. This formula is intended to ensure that `x` is divisible by `n` and also meets the requirement of ending with k zeros.

**Potential Issues:**
- The program relies on the `gcd` function from the `math` module, which is not imported. This will raise a `NameError` when the program is executed.
- The calculation `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` is meant to adjust `n` so that the result is divisible by `multiplier`. However, if `n` is already a multiple of `multiplier`, this could lead to an incorrect calculation of `x`.

**Example Case for Failure:**
Consider the input `n = 100, k = 2`:
- The `multiplier` would be `100` (since `10 ** 2 = 100`).
- The `gcd(100, 100)` is `100`, so `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` equals `1`.
- The calculation for `x` would be `100 * 1 = 100`, which does indeed end with 2 zeros and is divisible by `n`.

However, if we consider the input `n = 375, k = 4`:
- The `multiplier` would be `10000` (since `10 ** 4 = 10000`).
- The `gcd(375, 10000)` is `125`, so `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` equals `80`.
- The calculation for `x` would be `375 * 80 = 30000`, which is correct.

But if we test with `n = 10, k = 1`:
- The `multiplier` would be `10`.
- The `gcd(10, 10)` is `10`, so `multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)` equals `1`.
- The calculation for `x` would be `10 * 1 = 10`, which is correct.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not handle all edge cases correctly due to the reliance on the `gcd` function without proper imports and potential miscalculations in certain scenarios. Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
