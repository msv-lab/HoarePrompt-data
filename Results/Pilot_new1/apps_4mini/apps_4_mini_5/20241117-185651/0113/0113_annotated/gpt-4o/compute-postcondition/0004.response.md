Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the product of `n` and the result of dividing the multiplier by the greatest common divisor of `n` and the multiplier. It does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in practical scenarios. **
