The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` can be any non-negative integer from 0 to 8, so the possible values of `x` are from `1` (when `k` is `0`) to `10000000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the range of possible values for `x` based on the input `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, which can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000, or 1000000000.**
