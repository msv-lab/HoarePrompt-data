The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and since `n` was previously `n + 2`, the new value of `n` will be `n + 3`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is now `n + 3`, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 3`, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
