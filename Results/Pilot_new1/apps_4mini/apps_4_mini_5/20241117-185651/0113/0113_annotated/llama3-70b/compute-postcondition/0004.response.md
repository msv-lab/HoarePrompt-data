The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is `n + 1`, so after execution, `n` becomes `n + 2`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now `n + 2`, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 2`, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
