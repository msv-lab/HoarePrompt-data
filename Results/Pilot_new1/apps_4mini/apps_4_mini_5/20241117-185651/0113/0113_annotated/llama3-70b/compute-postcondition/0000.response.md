The values of `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are converted to integers. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8, the output state will reflect that `n` and `k` are now assigned specific integer values based on user input. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
