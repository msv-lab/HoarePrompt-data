Output State: **`if n is a multiple of x then n remains unchanged; if n is not a multiple of x then n will be incremented until it becomes a multiple of x, resulting in n being equal to the next multiple of x (which is n + (x - (n % x))) and k remains unchanged. If n is initially a multiple of x, the loop does not execute and n remains the same.`**
