The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer and not a multiple of 10, after the increment, `n` will still be a positive integer and will not be a multiple of 10. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1 and not a multiple of 10; `k` is a non-negative integer; `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1 and not a multiple of 10; `k` is a non-negative integer; `x` is 10**
