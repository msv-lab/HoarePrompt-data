The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8. This means `x` will take on the values of 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 based on the value of `k`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), and `x` is 10 ** k**
