The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, the value of `multiplier` will be one of the following: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `multiplier` is 10 raised to the power of `k`**
