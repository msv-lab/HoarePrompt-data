The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and n is not equal to 9, the new value of `n` will be in the range of 2 to 10^9 + 1, excluding 10. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 1 and n is not equal to 10; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 1 and n is not equal to 10; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10**
