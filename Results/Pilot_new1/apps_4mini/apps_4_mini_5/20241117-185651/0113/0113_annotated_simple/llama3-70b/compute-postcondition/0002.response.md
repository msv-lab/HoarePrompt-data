The value of `n` is incremented by 1, but the specific previous value of `n` is unknown as it is an input positive integer. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10, and `n` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10; `n` is incremented by 1**
