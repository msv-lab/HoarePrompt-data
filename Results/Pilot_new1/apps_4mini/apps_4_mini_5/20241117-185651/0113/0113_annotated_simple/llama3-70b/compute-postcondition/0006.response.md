`n` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 1 and n is not equal to 10, so after execution, `n` will be in the range of 3 to 10^9 + 2, excluding 11. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is in the range of 3 to 10^9 + 2 (excluding 11), `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is 10.

Output State: **`n` is in the range of 3 to 10^9 + 2 (excluding 11), `k` is an input non-negative integer, `x` is 10**
