Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `_` is n-1, `min_time` is updated to `time` if `time` is less than the previous value of `min_time`, and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. The value of `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d.***
