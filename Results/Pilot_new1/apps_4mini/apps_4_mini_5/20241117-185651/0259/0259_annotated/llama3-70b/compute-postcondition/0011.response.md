According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, starting from `_` equal to 0 up to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, which indicates that the loop has executed 2 times. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 3, and it must still be less than `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, and currently `_` is 2, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `n` is at least 3, `_` is now 3, and the other variables remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains three tuples (previous tuples, (s, d)), `_` is 3, and `s` and `d` are input integers.**
