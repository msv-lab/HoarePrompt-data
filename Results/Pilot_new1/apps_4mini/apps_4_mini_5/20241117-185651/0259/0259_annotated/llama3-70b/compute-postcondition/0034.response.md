The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and for each bus route, `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate based on the internal logic that uses the given constraints and relationships, although the exact return value is not described. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on internal constraints related to bus routes and integers, but the specific return value is not provided.**
