The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from the input, which accepts two integers. The previous values of the affected variables are not known, but `s` and `d` will hold the values provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, and `s` and `d` are input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are input integers**
