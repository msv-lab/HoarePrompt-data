Output State: **`min_time` is the minimum time calculated from the tuples in `buses`, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that has the minimum time. If `buses` is empty, then the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains float('inf') and `ans` remains -1. If `buses` contains at least one tuple, `min_time` will be updated to reflect the smallest time calculated as (t - s) % d for each bus, and `ans` will reflect the index of that bus.**
