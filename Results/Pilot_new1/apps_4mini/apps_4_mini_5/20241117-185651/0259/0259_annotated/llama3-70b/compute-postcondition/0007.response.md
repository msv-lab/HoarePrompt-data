The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers, and the previous state of the `buses` list contains one tuple. The `buses` list will now contain two tuples after the operation. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples (previous tuple, (s, d)), `_` is 1**
