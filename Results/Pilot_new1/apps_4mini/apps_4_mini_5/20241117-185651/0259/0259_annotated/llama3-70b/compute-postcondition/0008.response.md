According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `n` must remain unchanged as it can still support another iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples (previous tuple, (s, d)), `_` is 2**
