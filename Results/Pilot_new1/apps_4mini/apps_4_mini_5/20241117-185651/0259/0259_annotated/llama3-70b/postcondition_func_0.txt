The function reads two integers `n` and `t` from input, where `n` represents the number of buses and `t` is a time value. It then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` for each bus, storing them in a list. The function calculates the minimum time until the next bus arrives based on the formula `(t - s) % d` for each bus. It identifies the index (1-based) of the bus that has the minimum waiting time and prints this index. If there are no buses, it prints `-1`. Edge cases include handling when `n` is 0, resulting in no buses to process, and therefore the output is `-1`. Additionally, if all buses have a start time greater than `t`, the function will still return the bus with the minimum calculated time based on the modulo operation.
