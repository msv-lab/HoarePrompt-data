The `buses` list is modified by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it. The previous state of `buses` contained two tuples, and now it will contain three tuples after the append operation. The values of `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains three tuples (previous tuples, (s, d)), `_` is 2, and `s` and `d` are input integers.**
