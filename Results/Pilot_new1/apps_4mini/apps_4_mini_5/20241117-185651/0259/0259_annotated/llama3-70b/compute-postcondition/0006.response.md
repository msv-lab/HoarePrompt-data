The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are converted to integers. The previous state indicates that `s` and `d` were not defined before this input, but they will now hold specific integer values based on user input. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains one tuple (s, d), `_` is 1, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
