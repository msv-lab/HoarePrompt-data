Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers. If `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` (which is 1 in this case). This accounts for all scenarios where `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, resulting in a non-negative wait time, or where `s_i` is less than `t`, considering both divisibility and the calculation of wait time to ensure it remains non-negative. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
