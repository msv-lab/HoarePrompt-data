The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The initial state indicates that `s_i` is the first element from `bus_routes` and is greater than or equal to `t`, which means `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables after the assignment.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are the first tuple from `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t` (non-negative integer)**.
