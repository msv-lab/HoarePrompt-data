According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, the loop variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must remain a positive integer, and `i` should be set to 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
