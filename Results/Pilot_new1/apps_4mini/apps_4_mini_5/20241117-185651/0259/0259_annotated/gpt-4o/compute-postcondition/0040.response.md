The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
- `t` is a positive integer that must be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `(s_i, d_i)` such that both `s_i` and `d_i` are between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.

After executing the function body, it returns the index of the chosen bus route if a suitable route is found; otherwise, it returns -1 if no suitable route was found.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of a suitable bus route or -1 if no suitable route is found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (positive integer), `t` (positive integer), and `bus_routes` (list of tuples of positive integers), and returns the index of a suitable bus route or -1 if no suitable route is found.**
