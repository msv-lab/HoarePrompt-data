Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are the first tuple from `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, which is a non-negative integer. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` remains non-negative. This includes all edge cases where `s_i` is equal to, less than, or greater than `t`, and considers the divisibility of the wait time calculation.***
