The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `wait_time` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[2], and `wait_time` is 0**
