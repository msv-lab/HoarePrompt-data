Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers. If `s_i` (the first element of `bus_routes[2]`) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, indicating the time to wait until the bus departs. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, meaning the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, then `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always a non-negative integer, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all cases for the bus schedule based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`.***
