The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `chosen_route` becomes `0 + 1`, which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are the first tuple from `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.
