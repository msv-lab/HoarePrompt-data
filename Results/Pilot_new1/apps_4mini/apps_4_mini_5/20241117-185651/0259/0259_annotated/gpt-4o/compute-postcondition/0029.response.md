To determine the output state, we analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. The variable `i` is assigned the value of `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
2. The values `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the `bus_routes` list at index `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` will be the first and second elements of the tuple at index `n` in `bus_routes`.
3. The `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000.

The specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` depend on the contents of `bus_routes` and the values of `n` and `t`. However, the output state can be summarized based on the relationships established.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing two positive integers, `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.**
