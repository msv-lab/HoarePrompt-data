The code assigns the value of `i + 1` to `chosen_route`. The variable `i` is not provided in the initial state, but it is implied that it is a non-negative integer based on the context. The value of `chosen_route` will be one greater than whatever value `i` holds. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
