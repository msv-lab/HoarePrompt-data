The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous values of `min_wait_time`, `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, while `i` is equal to `n`, and `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from `bus_routes[n]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `min_wait_time` to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `i` is equal to `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged.**
