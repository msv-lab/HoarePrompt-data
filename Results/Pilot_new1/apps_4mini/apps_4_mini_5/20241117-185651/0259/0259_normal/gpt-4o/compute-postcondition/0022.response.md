Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, while `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, with `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remaining unchanged. This ensures that `wait_time` is always a non-negative value, as it accounts for the wait time until the next bus based on the current time `t` and the schedule defined by `s_i` and `d_i`.***
