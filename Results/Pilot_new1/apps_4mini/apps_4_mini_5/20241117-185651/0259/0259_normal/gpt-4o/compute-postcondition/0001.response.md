The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time`). Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `chosen_route` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), and `chosen_route` is -1**
