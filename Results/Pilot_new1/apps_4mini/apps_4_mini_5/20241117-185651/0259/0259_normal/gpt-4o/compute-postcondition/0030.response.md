The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, and all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new value of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `wait_time` is 0; `min_wait_time` remains unchanged; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `i` is equal to `n`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]**
