According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, which is outside the range of the loop. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `n`, and no other states need to be modified.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`; `i` is `n`**
