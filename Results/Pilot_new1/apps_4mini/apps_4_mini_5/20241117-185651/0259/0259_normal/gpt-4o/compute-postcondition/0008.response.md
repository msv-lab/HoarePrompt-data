The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. It does not depend on any other variables or conditions, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `wait_time` without any changes to other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.**
