The `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given the constraints:

- `s_i` is less than `t`
- The value of `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0

This means that `wait_time` will be a positive integer since `d_i` is a positive integer and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is a non-zero value.

Since the specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `wait_time`. However, we can conclude that `wait_time` will be a positive integer based on the provided conditions.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `wait_time` has been calculated but does not specify its exact value due to the lack of specific inputs.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**.
