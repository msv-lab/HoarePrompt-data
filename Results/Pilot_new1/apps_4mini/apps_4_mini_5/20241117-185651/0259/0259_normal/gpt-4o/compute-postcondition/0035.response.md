The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `chosen_route` becomes `n + 1`. The values of `min_wait_time`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `i` is equal to `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `chosen_route` is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `i` is equal to `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, and `chosen_route` is `n + 1**
