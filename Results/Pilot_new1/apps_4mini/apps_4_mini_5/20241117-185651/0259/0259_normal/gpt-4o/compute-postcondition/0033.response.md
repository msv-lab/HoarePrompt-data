Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; if `s_i` (the start time of the bus route) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `t` is equal to `s_i` plus a multiple of `d_i` (the duration of the bus route), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that all scenarios regarding the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are addressed. Throughout this process, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`, with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.***
