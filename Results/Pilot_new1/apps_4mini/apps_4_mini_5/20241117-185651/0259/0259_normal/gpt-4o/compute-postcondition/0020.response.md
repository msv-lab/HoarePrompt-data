The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `0`. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is 0, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged.
