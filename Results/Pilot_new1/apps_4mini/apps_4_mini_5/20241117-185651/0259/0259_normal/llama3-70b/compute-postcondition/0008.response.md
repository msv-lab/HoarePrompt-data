According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, which means the loop can execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to reflect that one iteration will be completed, so it should be decreased by 1. The values of `t` and `buses` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d), (s, d)]**
