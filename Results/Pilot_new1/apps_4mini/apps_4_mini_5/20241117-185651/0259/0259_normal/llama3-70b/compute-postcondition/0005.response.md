According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and since it has already executed once, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the number of times it has already executed. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100) and the loop has executed once. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `t`, `buses`, `s`, and `d` do not influence the number of iterations left for the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d)], `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
