The values of `s` and `d` are assigned based on the input provided by the user, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the split input strings into integers. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `s` and `d` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d), (s, d)], and `s`, `d` are input integers**.
