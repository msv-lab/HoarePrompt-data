According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 2 tuples, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `buses` has at least 1 tuple, and `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 tuples, and `i` should be 1 for the next iteration. 

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `min_time` remains unchanged, `ans` remains unchanged**
