The code appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the `buses` list. Since `buses` is initially an empty list, after executing this line, `buses` will contain one tuple: `(s, d)`. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is now [(s, d)], `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
