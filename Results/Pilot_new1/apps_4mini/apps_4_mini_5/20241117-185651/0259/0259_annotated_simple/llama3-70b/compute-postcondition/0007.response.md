The code appends the tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are input positive integers, and the initial state of `buses` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a list that can hold tuples. The state of `n`, `t`, and `_` is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of the tuple to the `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 1, `s` is an input positive integer, `d` is an input positive integer, and `buses` now contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
