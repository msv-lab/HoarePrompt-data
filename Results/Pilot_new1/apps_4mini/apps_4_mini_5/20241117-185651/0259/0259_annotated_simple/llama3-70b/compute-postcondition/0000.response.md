The values of `n` and `t` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string that is then split into two parts and converted to integers by `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not changed directly by this line of code; instead, they are reassigned based on user input. The output state reflects that `n` and `t` are now set to specific positive integers within the given constraints.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and they are assigned values from input.**
