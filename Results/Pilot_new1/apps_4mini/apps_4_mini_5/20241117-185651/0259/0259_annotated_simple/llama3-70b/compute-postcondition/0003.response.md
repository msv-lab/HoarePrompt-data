The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which is split into two parts and converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `s` and `d` will depend on the user's input but will be positive integers. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `s` and `d` based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 0, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is a positive integer from input, `d` is a positive integer from input**
