According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Since it is stated that `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples where `n` is 0 or more, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to run. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0, and `(s, d)` should be the first tuple in the `buses` list.

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the buses list**
