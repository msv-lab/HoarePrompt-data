The function reads input values for the number of buses `n` and a time `t`, then collects `n` tuples representing the start time `s` and duration `d` of each bus. It calculates the minimum time until the next bus arrives based on the formula `(t - s) % d`. The function returns the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum wait time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating no buses are available.
