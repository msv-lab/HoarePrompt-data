Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the buses list, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to 1. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
