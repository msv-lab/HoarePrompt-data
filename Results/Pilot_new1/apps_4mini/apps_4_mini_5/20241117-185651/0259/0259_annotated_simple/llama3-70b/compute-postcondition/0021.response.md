According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list of buses and the index `i`. The `enumerate` function will continue to iterate over the `buses` list as long as `i` is less than the length of the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and there is at least one tuple in the `buses` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and the next tuple `(s, d)` must be the second tuple in the `buses` list.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 1 and `(s, d)` is the second tuple in the list.

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `i` is 1, `(s, d)` is the second tuple in the buses list**
