The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as positive integers from input. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `_` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the `buses` list with the newly appended tuple.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 0, `buses` is a list containing the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is a positive integer from input, `d` is a positive integer from input**
