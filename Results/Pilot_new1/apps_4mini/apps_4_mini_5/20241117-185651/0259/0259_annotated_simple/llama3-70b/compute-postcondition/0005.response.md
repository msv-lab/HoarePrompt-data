According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `_` (the loop variable) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be less than `n`. Since `_` is currently 0, and `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. After the last iteration, `_` would be incremented by 1, making it 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, to prepare for the next iteration, we need to adjust the state of `_` to reflect this increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is 1, `buses` is a list containing the tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is a positive integer from input, `d` is a positive integer from input**
