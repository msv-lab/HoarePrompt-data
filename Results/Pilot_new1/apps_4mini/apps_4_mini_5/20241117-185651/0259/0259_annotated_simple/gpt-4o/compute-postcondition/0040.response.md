The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of bus routes, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `t` is a positive integer that represents the time, constrained such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers \(s_i\) and \(d_i\) that represent the start and destination of each bus route, constrained such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\).

After executing the function body, it returns the index of the chosen bus route that offers the minimum wait time. This index is either a valid index (1-based) or -1 if no suitable routes exist. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if no suitable routes are available. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time), and bus_routes (list of tuples of bus routes), and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if no suitable routes exist.**
