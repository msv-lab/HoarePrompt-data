The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The initial state specifies that `s_i` and `d_i` have been assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, but the exact values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided. However, since `n` is greater than `i + 1`, it implies that `i` is within the bounds of the `bus_routes` array. The output state reflects the assignment of `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i` and `t`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
