The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initialization of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is 0**
