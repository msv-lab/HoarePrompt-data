The variable `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the digits in `cube`. The value of `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and since `n` can be either 2 or 3, `cube` will contain the elements of the second list accordingly. The specific integers in `cube` are not provided, but they will be converted to strings and added to `digits`. 

The output state reflects that `digits` now contains the string representations of the integers from `cube`. Therefore, the output state depends on the elements of `cube`, but since we don't have the specific values, we can only indicate that `digits` has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the digits in `cube`.**
