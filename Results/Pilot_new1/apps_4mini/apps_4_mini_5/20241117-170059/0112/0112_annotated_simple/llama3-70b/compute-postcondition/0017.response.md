Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer `n` from input, representing the number of subsequent lines of input. It then reads `n` lines, each containing a list of integers, and collects all unique digits (0-9) from these lists into a set. If '0' is present in the set of digits, it is removed. Finally, the function constructs the largest possible integer from the remaining digits by sorting them in descending order and prints this integer. If no digits are present, the function will attempt to create an integer from an empty set, which may lead to an error. Therefore, the function does not handle the case where no valid digits are provided and will print an empty string or cause an error in that scenario.**
