According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each `cube` in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3, indicating that there are 3 lists in `cubes`, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next `cube` must be the fourth list in `cubes`, which means `cubes` must contain at least 4 lists. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to indicate that there are at least 4 lists in `cubes`, and `cube` should be updated to refer to the fourth list.

State: **`n` is at least 4; `cubes` is a list of at least 4 lists of integers; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the digits in `cube`.**
