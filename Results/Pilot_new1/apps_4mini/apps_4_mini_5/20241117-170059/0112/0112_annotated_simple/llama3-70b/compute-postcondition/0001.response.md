The variable `cubes` is assigned a list that is generated by a list comprehension. This comprehension iterates `n` times (where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and, during each iteration, it takes an input, splits it into components, and maps them to integers. The previous value of `n` determines how many lists will be created in `cubes`. The specific values of the lists depend on the input provided during execution.

Since the exact input is not specified, we can only describe the output state in general terms. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers based on user input**.
