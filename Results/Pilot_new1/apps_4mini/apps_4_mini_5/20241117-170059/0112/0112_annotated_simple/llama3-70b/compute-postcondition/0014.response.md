The code assigns `max_num` the value of the maximum number that can be formed by sorting the elements in `digits` in descending order and joining them into a string, then converting that string to an integer. The initial state indicates that `digits` is a set of unique string representations of digits, and it has been ensured that '0' is not present in `digits`. The specific value of `max_num` depends on the contents of `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` contains unique string representations of digits without '0'; `max_num` is the integer formed by the digits sorted in descending order.**
