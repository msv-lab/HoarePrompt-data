According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1, and `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted since `digits`, `digit`, and `used_cubes[1]` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.

State: **`digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
