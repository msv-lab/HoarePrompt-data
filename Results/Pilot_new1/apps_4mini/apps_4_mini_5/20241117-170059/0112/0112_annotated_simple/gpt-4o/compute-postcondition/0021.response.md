Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of boolean values where at least one element is set to True if `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` corresponding to the indices checked, `found` is set to True if `digit` is found in any cube face, and `i` indicates the index of the cube where `digit` was found (if it was found). If `digit` is not found in any cube face or if all corresponding `used_cubes` are already True, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` remains False, and `i` will not be updated. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0, in which case `used_cubes` remains [False] * n, `found` is False, and `i` is undefined.**
