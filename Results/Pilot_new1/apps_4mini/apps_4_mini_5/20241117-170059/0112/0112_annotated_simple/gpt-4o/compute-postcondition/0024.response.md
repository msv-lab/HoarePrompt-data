Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False, leaving `used_cubes` unchanged, `found` remains False, and `i` is undefined. If `found` is True, the function does not execute this block, and the state of `used_cubes`, `found`, and `i` will depend on the previous operations in the program. If `n` is 0, `used_cubes` remains [False] * n, `found` is False, and `i` is undefined, ensuring that all edge cases are covered.***
