The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `used_cubes[1]` is set to `True`, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
