Output State: **If `n` is greater than 0 and `digits` has at least one character, the loop will attempt to find each digit in `cube_faces`, marking the corresponding index in `used_cubes` as True if a match is found. If all digits are found, `used_cubes` will contain True values for the matched indices, and `found` will be True for those iterations. If any digit cannot be matched with the available `cube_faces`, `found` will be False, and the function will return False. If `n` is 0, `used_cubes` remains an empty list, and the loop does not execute. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged.**
