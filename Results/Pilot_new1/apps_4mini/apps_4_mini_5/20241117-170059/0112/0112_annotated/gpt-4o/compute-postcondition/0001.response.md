The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with `n` boolean values, all set to `False`. This means that for each cube represented in `cube_faces`, it indicates that none of the cubes have been used yet. The previous values of the affected variables are `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 3, and `cube_faces`, which is a list of `n` lists. The state of `digits` is not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` as a string, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` as a string, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`**.
