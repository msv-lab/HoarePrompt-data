The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes[2]` is now `True`, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
