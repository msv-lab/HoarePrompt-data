According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure that `i` is still less than `n`.

Since `n` is at least 2, we can adjust it to be greater than 3 to allow for one more iteration. The value of `i` should also be updated to reflect the next iteration, which would be 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, and `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character.**
