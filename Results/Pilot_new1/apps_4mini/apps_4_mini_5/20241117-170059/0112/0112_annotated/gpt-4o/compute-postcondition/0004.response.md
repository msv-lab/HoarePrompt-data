According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer with a range of (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once, as `n` is at least 1. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take on values starting from 0 up to `n-1`. 

The initial state also includes `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `digit`, and `found`, but these do not affect the execution of the loop itself. However, we can note that at the beginning of the first iteration, `i` will be 0.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to confirm that `n` is at least 1, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values all set to `False`, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is set to False**
