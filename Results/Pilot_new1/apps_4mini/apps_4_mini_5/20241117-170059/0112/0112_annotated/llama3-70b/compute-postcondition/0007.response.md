According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must have at least 3 lists, and since `cube` is currently the second list, it needs to be updated to the third list in `cubes`. Additionally, since the loop variable `cube` will take on the next list in `cubes`, the state of `cubes` must reflect that it has at least 3 lists.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, and `digits` remains updated.**
