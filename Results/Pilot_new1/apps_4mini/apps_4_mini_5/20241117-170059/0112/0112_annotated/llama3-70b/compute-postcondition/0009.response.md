According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop iterates over each `cube` in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be the fourth list in `cubes`. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `cubes` must have at least 4 lists,
- `cube` must be the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 4 lists, `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with the string representations of elements in `cube`.**
