Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers from the lists in `cubes`. If '0' is present in `digits`, it is removed. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If `cubes` contains at least one list, `digits` will include the string representations of the integers from those lists, excluding '0' if it was present.***
