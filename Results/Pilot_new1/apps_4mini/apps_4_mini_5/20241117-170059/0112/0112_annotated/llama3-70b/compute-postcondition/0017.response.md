Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` representing the number of lists (cubes), each containing 6 integers (digits from 0 to 9). It reads these lists, collects the unique string representations of the digits, removes '0' if present, and then constructs and prints the largest possible integer that can be formed by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. If no digits are available after processing, the function will raise an error when attempting to convert an empty string into an integer. **
