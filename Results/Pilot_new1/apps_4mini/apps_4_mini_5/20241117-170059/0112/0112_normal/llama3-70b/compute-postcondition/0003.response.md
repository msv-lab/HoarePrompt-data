According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list (i.e., at least one cube). The current state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, but it does not provide information about the contents of `cubes`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `cubes` is not empty.

Assuming that `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on input, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `cubes` contains at least one list. Additionally, since `cube` will be assigned the first list in `cubes` during the first iteration, we can denote that as `cube is the first cube in cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first cube in cubes, `digits` is an empty set**
