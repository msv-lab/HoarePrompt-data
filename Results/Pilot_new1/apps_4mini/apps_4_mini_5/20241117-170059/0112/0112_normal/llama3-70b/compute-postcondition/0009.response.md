According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more lists in `cubes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third cube in `cubes`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more list in `cubes` after the third one.

Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it indicates that there are at least 3 lists in `cubes`, and since `cube` is the third cube, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `cube` should refer to the fourth cube in the list, and `cubes` must contain at least 4 lists.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 4 lists; `cube` is the fourth cube in `cubes`; `digits` now contains string representations of the integers in `cube`, plus new string representations from `cube`.**
