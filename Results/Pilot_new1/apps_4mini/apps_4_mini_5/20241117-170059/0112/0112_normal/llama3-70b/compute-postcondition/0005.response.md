According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` has more than 1 list, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 list, `cube` is the first cube in the list, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must contain at least 2 lists. Additionally, since `cube` is currently the first cube, it will need to be the second cube in the next iteration. The variable `n` does not need to be adjusted as it is not directly affecting the loop execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second cube in cubes, and `digits` is updated to contain string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
