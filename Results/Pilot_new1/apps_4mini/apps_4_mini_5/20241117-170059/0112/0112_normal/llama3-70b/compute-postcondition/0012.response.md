The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since the initial state specifies that `digits` includes the string '0', it will be successfully removed. The other variables or the contents of `cubes` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the removal of '0' from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0'**
