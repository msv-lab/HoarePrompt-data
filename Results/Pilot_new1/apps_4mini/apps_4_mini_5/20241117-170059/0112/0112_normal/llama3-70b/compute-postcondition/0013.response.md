Postcondition: ***`digits` contains string representations of all integers found in the lists within `cubes`, and if '0' was present in `digits`, it has been removed. If `digits` initially contained '0', it no longer does; if `digits` did not contain '0', it remains unchanged. If `cubes` is an empty list, `digits` remains an empty set.***
