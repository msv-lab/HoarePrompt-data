The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of `int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))`. This means that the `digits` are sorted in reverse order and joined into a single string, which is then converted to an integer. The initial state indicates that `digits` does not contain '0' (if it initially did, it has been removed), and if `cubes` is empty, `digits` would also be empty. 

If `digits` is empty, the sorted operation would result in an empty string, and converting that to an integer would lead to `0`. If `digits` contains other digits, the maximum number would be determined by the sorted order of those digits.

Thus, the output state depends on the content of `digits`:

- If `digits` is empty, `max_num` will be `0`.
- If `digits` contains other digits, `max_num` will be the largest integer formed by those digits.

Since we don't have the specific contents of `digits`, we must consider both scenarios.

Output State: **`max_num` is either 0 (if `digits` is empty) or an integer formed by the maximum digits in `digits`.**
