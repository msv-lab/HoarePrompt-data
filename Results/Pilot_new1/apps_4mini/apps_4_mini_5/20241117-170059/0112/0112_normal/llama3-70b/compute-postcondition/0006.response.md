The `digits` set is updated to include string representations of the integers in `cube`. The previous value of `cube` is a list of integers, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube` will contain at least 2 integers. The exact integers in `cube` are not specified, but they will be converted to strings and added to `digits`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `digits`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second cube in cubes, and `digits` now contains string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
