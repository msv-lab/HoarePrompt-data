The value of `found` is assigned `True`, but it is already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, there is no change to the value of `found`, and the other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `used_cubes` has its second element set to True, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`**
