Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False, indicating that `digit` was not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists with the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` being False. If `found` is True, the function does not execute the return statement and continues with the remaining program logic, which is not specified in the provided fragment.***
