Output State: **If `digits` is a list with at least one element, the loop iterates over each `digit`. If a `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` lists where the corresponding `used_cubes[i]` is False, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, and the loop continues. If a `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists, `found` remains False, and the function returns False. If `digits` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all False).**
