According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it allows for `i` to be 2. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `used_cubes` and `found` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`**
