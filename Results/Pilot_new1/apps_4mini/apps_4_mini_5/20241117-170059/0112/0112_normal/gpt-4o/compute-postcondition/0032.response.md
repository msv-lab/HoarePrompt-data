The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `num`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 3, and `cube_faces`, which is a list containing `num` lists, each containing 6 integers where each integer is in the range 0 to 9. 

The function checks if a list named `digits` (not explicitly mentioned in the parameters but implied) contains any elements. If `digits` is non-empty and each `digit` can be found in any of the `cube_faces` lists with the corresponding `used_cubes` entry being False, it marks that cube as used. If any `digit` is not found, the function returns False. If `digits` is empty, the function does not perform any checks and retains the state of `used_cubes`.

If all `digits` are found successfully, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` (1 ≤ num ≤ 3) and a list `cube_faces` containing `num` lists of 6 integers each (0 to 9). It returns True if all digits can be formed using the cube faces; otherwise, it returns False.**
