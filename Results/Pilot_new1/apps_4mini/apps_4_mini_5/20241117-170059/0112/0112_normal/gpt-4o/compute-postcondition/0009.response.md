Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where the first element is set to True if `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` was originally False, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. If `used_cubes[i]` was already True or `digit` was not in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False.***
