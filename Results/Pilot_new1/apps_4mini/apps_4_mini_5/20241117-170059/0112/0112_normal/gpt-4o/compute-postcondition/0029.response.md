According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more digits in the list to process. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, and the length of `digits` is greater than the current index of the last processed digit + 1. 

Since `digit` is the next digit, it implies that the current index of the last processed digit is the index of `digit` minus 1. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more digit in the `digits` list after the current `digit`. Therefore, we need to adjust the length of `digits` to be greater than the current index of the last processed digit + 2, and `digit` should be the next digit in the list.

Thus, we adjust the states accordingly.

State: **`found` is False, `digit` is the next digit in the digits list, and the length of `digits` is greater than the current index of the last processed digit + 2**
