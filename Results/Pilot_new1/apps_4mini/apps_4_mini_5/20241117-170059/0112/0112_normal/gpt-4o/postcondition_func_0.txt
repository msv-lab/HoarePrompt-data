The function accepts an integer `n` (expected to be between 1 and 3 inclusive) and a list of `n` lists (each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9). It returns the largest integer `x` such that `can_form_number(x + 1)` is true. The value of `x` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, depending on the results of the `can_form_number` function. If `can_form_number(1)` is false from the start, `x` will remain 0, indicating that no numbers can be formed. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the expected range or where the lists do not contain exactly 6 integers.
