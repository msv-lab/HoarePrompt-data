According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to 1. 

Since `n` is at least 1 and can be up to 3, we can conclude that `n` must now be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the only adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be 1 (to reflect the next iteration).
- `n` should be greater than 1 (to ensure that the loop can still execute).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
