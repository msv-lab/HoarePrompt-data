The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with a length of `n`, where each element is set to `False`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the possible lengths for `used_cubes` can be 1, 2, or 3. The values of `cube_faces` and `num` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, each containing 6 integers; `num` is undefined; `used_cubes` is a list of length n with all elements set to False**
