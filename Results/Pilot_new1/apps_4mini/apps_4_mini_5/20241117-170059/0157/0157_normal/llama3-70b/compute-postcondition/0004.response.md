To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first need to understand the calculation of `min_lemon`. The variable `min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

The code then calculates the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.

Since `min_lemon` is derived from the initial state, we can summarize its role in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the printed result is `min_lemon * 7`.**
