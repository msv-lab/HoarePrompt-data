To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the analysis:

### Problem Description:
Nikolay has a given number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). He wants to make a compote that requires the fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits he can use while adhering to this ratio.

### Program Code:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

### Output Hints:
The hints state that the program calculates the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used. The total fruits used is then printed as `min_lemon * 7`.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Calculation of `min_lemon`:** 
   - The program correctly calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum number of lemons that can be used given the constraints of apples and pears. 
   - This follows the requirement that for every lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.

2. **Total Calculation:**
   - The total number of fruits is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`. This is correct since it accounts for the total number of fruits used in the specified ratio.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case with insufficient pears:** If `c` is less than 4, `min_lemon` will be 0, leading to a total of 0 fruits. This is correctly handled as per the problem description.
- **Case with insufficient apples:** If `b` is less than 2, `min_lemon` will again be 0, leading to a total of 0 fruits. This is also correctly handled.
- **Case with just enough fruits:** If `a`, `b`, and `c` are exactly in the ratio (e.g., `a=1`, `b=2`, `c=4`), the program will return 7, which is correct.
- **Case with excessive fruits:** If `a=10`, `b=20`, `c=40`, the program will still correctly calculate the maximum as 70.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the program calculates `min_lemon`, and the total number of fruits used is indeed `min_lemon * 7`. There are no discrepancies between the hints and the code.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, it appears that the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all cases as required. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the specifications.

Correctness: **True**.
