The function prompts the user to input three integers, calculates the minimum of the first integer, half of the second integer, and a quarter of the third integer, and then prints the result of the formula `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. This effectively calculates and prints `min_lemon * 7`, where `min_lemon` is determined by the inputs. The function does not return any value and does not handle any potential input errors.
