To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet in relation to the initial state.

1. The initial state defines `a`, `b`, and `c` as input integers, and `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, so `max_lemons` will depend on those inputs.

2. The code snippet calculates `total_fruits` using the formula:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
   ```
   This can be simplified to:
   ```
   total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
   ```

3. The value of `total_fruits` is now determined by the value of `max_lemons`, which was computed based on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. The output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`.

Thus, the output state will be:
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
