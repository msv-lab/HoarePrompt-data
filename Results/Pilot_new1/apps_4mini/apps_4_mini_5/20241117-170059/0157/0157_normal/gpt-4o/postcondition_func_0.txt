The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, representing the number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the available fruits, considering that each lemon requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The function then computes the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons and prints this total. However, it does not return any values; it only prints the result. Additionally, there is no error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or negative numbers.
