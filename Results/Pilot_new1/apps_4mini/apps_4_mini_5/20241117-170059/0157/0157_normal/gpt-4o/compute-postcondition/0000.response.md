The variable `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` as an input integer while `b` and `c` retain their original values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
