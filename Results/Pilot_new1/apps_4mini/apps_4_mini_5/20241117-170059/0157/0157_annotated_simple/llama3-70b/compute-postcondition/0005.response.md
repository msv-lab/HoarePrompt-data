The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates with positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` that fall within the range of 1 to 1000. However, since there are no explicit parameters passed to the function in its definition, we cannot determine how these values are utilized or what the function returns. Therefore, without additional information on the output, we cannot specify the functionality of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not defined based on the provided information.**
