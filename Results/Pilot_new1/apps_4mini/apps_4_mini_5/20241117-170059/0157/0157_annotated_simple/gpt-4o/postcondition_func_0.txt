The function accepts three integer inputs: `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the constraints that each lemon requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The function then computes the total number of fruits used in this process and prints the result. Note that the function does not handle any input validation, so it assumes that inputs are provided correctly as integers. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the total number of fruits.
