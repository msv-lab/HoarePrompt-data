To determine the impact of the provided code snippet, we analyze the variables involved:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is a new input integer.
- `c` is a new input integer.

The line of code `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b` (i.e., `b // 2`), and a quarter of `c` (i.e., `c // 4`). 

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we do not have specific values for them, but we can state the relationship:

- `max_lemons` will hold the minimum of the three computed values.

Therefore, the output state can be described as:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**.
