To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is a new input integer.
   - `c` is a new input integer.
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
   - `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code `print(total_fruits)` outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine exact numerical values for `max_lemons` and `total_fruits`. However, we can express `total_fruits` in terms of the input integers.

- `total_fruits` will equal `max_lemons * 7`, where `max_lemons` is the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that `total_fruits` is dependent on the inputs.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**.
