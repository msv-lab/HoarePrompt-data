To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.

The code snippet is:
```
print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

1. The variable `min_lemon` is already defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be simplified:
   - It can be factored as `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.
3. The `print` function outputs the result of this calculation.

Since `min_lemon` is the minimum of the three input values, the output will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the output state will summarize the final calculation.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer, and the output is `min_lemon * 7`.**
