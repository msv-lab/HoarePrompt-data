Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote according to the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from the input.
2. It computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available quantities of each fruit:
   - `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - The number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
     - The number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. It calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons) + `max_lemons * 2` (for apples) + `max_lemons * 4` (for pears).
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles various cases correctly, including when there are not enough fruits of one type to make any compote, leading to a total of 0. All provided examples are correctly processed by the program, confirming its correctness.
