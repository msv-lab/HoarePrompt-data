To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the `while` loop conditions: `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`. 

1. The variable `i` is currently 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `s` is a string with a length between 1 and 100,000, `len(s)` is at least 1. Therefore, `i` being 1 means it can execute again if `len(s)` is greater than 1. If `len(s)` is exactly 1, then `i` will not satisfy the condition for the next iteration.

2. The variable `j` is not mentioned in the state provided, but it is crucial for the second condition (`j < target_len`). Since `target_len` is 26, `j` must be less than 26 for the loop to execute again. However, we have no information about the current value of `j`.

Given that we need to ensure both conditions are satisfied for the loop to execute one more time, we can conclude:

- If `len(s)` is greater than 1, `i` can remain as 1.
- We need to ensure `j` is less than 26 for the loop to continue.

Since we are not given the current value of `j`, we cannot make an assumption about it. Therefore, we will state that `j` must be less than 26.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `len(s)` must be greater than 1 if it is currently equal to 1.
- `j` must be adjusted to be less than 26.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is less than 26**
