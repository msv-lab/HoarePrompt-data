The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `s`, `j`, and `i` are not modified by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, `j` is less than 26, and `i` is equal to len(s) or 0 if `s` is empty. The print statement does not change the state of these variables.

Output State: **`s` contains all characters of `target` in order, `j` is less than 26, `i` is equal to len(s), and the function prints -1**
