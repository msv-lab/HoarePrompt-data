Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, and `j` is equal to `target_len`, the function prints `target`. If `s` does not contain all characters of `target`, then `j` is less than 26 and `i` is equal to `len(s)`, and the function prints -1. If `s` is empty or does not start the loop, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 0.***
