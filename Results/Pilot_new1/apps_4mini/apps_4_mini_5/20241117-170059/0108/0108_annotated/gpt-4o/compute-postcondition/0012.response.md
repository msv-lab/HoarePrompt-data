According to the code, the loop can execute again if both conditions `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are satisfied. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Since `s` is a string with a length greater than 1, `len(s)` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)`, which means `i` must be less than the length of the string `s`.

The variable `j` is less than 26, but we do not know its relationship to `target_len`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `j` is also less than `target_len`.

Thus, we need to adjust the conditions:
1. Since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than `len(s)`, which means `i` must be less than the length of `s` before the increment.
2. We need to ensure that `j` is still less than `target_len`.

Therefore, the state can be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is less than 26, and `i` is less than len(s) - 1**
