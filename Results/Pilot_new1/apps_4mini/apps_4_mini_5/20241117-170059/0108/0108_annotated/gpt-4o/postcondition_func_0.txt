The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If it does, the function prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, and it can handle strings of varying lengths, including empty strings. If `s` is empty or does not contain all characters of the alphabet in order, it will print -1.
