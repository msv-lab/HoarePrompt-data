Output State: **`if char is present in s then res` will be a string consisting of consecutive 'a's followed by `char` repeated for each occurrence of 'a' in `s`, plus the number of occurrences of `char` in `s` as it is replaced iteratively. `s` will have all occurrences of `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet until `char` is no longer present in `s`. `char` will be the last character that was checked in `s`, and `alphabet` will still contain characters after the last `char`. If `char` is not present in `s` initially, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged from its initial state. If `s` does not contain any characters that can be replaced, it will remain unchanged.**
