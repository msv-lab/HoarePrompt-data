According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the character following it in Unicode. This means that `char` may still be present in `s`, but we cannot determine its presence without additional information about `s` and `char`.

Since the loop checks for the existence of `char` in `s`, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the updated `s`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` still contains `char` after the last iteration.

State: **`s` contains `char` and `res` is unchanged**
