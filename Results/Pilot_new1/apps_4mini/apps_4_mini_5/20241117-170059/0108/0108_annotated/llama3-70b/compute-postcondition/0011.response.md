The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes immediately after `char` in the Unicode character set. Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, this replacement will successfully modify `s`. The variable `res` is not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `s` and the unchanged `res`.

Output State: **`s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the character following it in Unicode; `res` is unchanged**
