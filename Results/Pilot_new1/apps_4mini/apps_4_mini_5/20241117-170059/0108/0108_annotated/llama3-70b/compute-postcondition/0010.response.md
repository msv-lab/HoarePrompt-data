The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the existing value of `res`. Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of the original `char`, it indicates that `char` is a valid character from `s`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but it will now include the value of `char` added to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` has been updated to include `char`.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of the original `char`; `res` is updated to include `char`**
