According to the code, the loop iterates over the `alphabet`, which consists of the characters 'a' to 'z'. The execution of the loop does not depend on the string `s` or the variable `res`. The loop will execute regardless of the contents of `s` or the state of `res`. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `char` will take on the values of each character in `alphabet` sequentially. Since `res` is an empty string, it does not affect the execution of the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the only necessary state is that `char` is initialized to the first character of `alphabet`, which is 'a'.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
