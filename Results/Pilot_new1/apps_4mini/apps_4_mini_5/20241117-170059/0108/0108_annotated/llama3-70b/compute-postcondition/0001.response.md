The variable `alphabet` is assigned the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, which represents all lowercase English letters. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged, as this assignment does not affect `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `s` and the new assignment to `alphabet`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
