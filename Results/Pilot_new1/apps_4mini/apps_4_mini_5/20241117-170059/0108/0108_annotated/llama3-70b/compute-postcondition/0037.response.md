Output State: **`res` will be a string consisting of consecutive occurrences of each character in `s`, in the order of the alphabet, until `char` reaches 'z'. If `s` contains any characters, they will be replaced by the next character in the alphabet until no occurrences of `char` are left in `s`. If `s` contains no characters from the alphabet initially, the loop will not execute, `res` will remain an empty string, and `s` will remain unchanged. If `s` contains characters that are not in the alphabet (although this is not possible with the given constraints), the loop will still not execute for those characters. If `s` contains only characters up to 'z', it will be modified accordingly, and `char` will reach 'z' at the end of the loop.**
