The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is either 0 or 1**
