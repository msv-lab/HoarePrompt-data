According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is either 0 or 1.
- The length of `s` is greater than 2, which means it is at least 3.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be less than the length of `s`, which is at least 3. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to be 4 or more to ensure that the loop can execute again.
- `j` must also be less than `target_len` (which is 26). If `j` is currently 0 or 1, it satisfies this condition.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which must be increased to ensure the loop can iterate again.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 4; `j` is either 0 or 1**
