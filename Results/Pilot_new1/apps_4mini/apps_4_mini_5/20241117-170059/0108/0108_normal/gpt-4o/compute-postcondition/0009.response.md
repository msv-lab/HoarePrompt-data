The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` can be either 0 or 1, after execution, `j` will either be 1 or 2. The other variables `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 1 or 2.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is either 1 or 2**
