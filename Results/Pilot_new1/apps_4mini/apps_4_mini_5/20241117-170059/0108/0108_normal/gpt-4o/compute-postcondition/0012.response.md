According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `s`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `s` is a string with a length greater than 1 (let's denote this length as `len(s)` which is greater than 1).
- `target_len` is 26.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is either 0 or 1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` must be less than `len(s)`. Since `len(s)` is greater than 1, `i` (which is 2) must be less than `len(s)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than 2.
2. `j` must be less than `target_len`. Given that `j` is either 0 or 1, it is already less than 26, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `len(s)` is greater than 2.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is either 0 or 1**
