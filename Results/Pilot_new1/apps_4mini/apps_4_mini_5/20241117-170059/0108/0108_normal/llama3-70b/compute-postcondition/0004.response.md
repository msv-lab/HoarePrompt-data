`res` is assigned the value of `res + char`. Since `res` is initially an empty string and `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` becomes 'a'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is 'a'; `char` is 'a'**
