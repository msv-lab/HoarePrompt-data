Output State: **`if s contains characters from 'a' to 'z', then res is a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in s, and s will have all occurrences of `char` replaced with the next character in the ASCII sequence. If `char` is not in `s`, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain unchanged, while `s` will remain the same.`**
