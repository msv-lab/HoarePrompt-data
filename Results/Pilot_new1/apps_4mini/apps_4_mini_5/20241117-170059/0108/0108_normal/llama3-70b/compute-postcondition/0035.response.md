Output State: **`if char is in s then res` will be a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s` plus all occurrences of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet for each iteration until `char` is no longer in `s`. If `char` is not in `s` at the start, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain unchanged, while `s` will also remain unchanged.**
