According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is still in `s`, which means the loop can execute again.

Since there are no indications that `char` will be removed from `s` in the next iteration, and `char` is confirmed to still be present, there is no need to adjust the states.

State: **`s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `res` is updated by appending `char`; `char` is still in `s`.**
