To analyze the loop's output state, let's consider how the loop operates with the provided initial state and the loop code. 

The loop continues executing as long as `char` is found in the string `s`. During each iteration, the first occurrence of `char` in `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet (`char + 1`), and `char` is appended to `res`. 

1. If `s` contains the character 'a', the loop will run, replacing the first 'a' with 'b', and `res` will start accumulating 'a'.
2. The loop will continue to execute until there are no occurrences of the current `char` in `s`. This means that if `s` initially contains multiple occurrences of the same character, `char` will be processed multiple times until there are no more characters of that type left to replace.
3. As `char` is incremented with each loop iteration, once it reaches 'z', the loop will stop executing since 'z' does not have a successor in the alphabet.

Now, let's summarize the output state after the loop has finished executing:

- If `s` initially contains characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` will contain a sequence of characters starting from 'a' and increasing until the last character found in `s`.
- If `s` does not contain 'a', the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string.
- If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z' (which is impossible given the constraints), the loop won't start.

Considering these points, the output state can be articulated as follows:

Output State: **`if s contains characters from 'a' to 'z', then res is a string consisting of the characters from 'a' to the last character found in s, and s will be modified accordingly. If s does not contain 'a', the loop does not execute and res remains an empty string.`**
