The function reads a string input consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string by replacing each occurrence of characters from 'a' to 'z' in the input with the next character in the ASCII sequence. If the resulting string contains exactly 26 characters (indicating that all letters from 'a' to 'z' were found and replaced), it prints the resulting string; otherwise, it prints -1. If the input does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the function will print -1.
