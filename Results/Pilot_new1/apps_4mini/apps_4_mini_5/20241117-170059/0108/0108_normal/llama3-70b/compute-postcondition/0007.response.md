The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. Initially, `res` is 'a' and `char` is also 'a'. After executing the code, `res` becomes 'aa'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` contains 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
