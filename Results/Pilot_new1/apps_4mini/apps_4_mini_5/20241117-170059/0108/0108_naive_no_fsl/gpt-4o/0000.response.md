Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to transform the input string into a string that contains the entire English alphabet as a subsequence. 

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Input: `abcxyz`

In this case, the program will check if the characters in the input string can form the subsequence `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`. The program will find that `a`, `b`, and `c` are present, and then it will check for `d`, which is not present. Since the program does not account for the ability to replace characters (for example, transforming `x` to `d`, `y` to `e`, and `z` to `f`), it will incorrectly output `-1`.

The program should allow for character replacements to ensure that the full sequence of the alphabet can be formed as a subsequence. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
