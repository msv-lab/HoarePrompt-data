According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found within `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'c', `res` is 'azab', and `char` is 'b'. Since `char` ('b') is not in `s` ('c'), the loop cannot execute again.

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be changed to a character that is present in `s`. Since `s` is 'c', `char` should be adjusted to 'c'.

State: **`s` is 'c', `res` is 'azab', `char` is 'c'**
