According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'a', `res` is 'az', and `char` is 'z'. Since 'z' is not in 'a', the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to be changed to a character that is present in `s`. 

Since `s` contains 'a', `char` must be adjusted to 'a' for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is 'a', `res` is 'az', `char` is 'a'**
