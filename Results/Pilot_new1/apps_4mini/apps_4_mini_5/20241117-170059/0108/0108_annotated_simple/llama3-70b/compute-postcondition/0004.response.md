The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. The initial value of `res` is an empty string (`''`), and `char` is `'a'`. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes `'a'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
