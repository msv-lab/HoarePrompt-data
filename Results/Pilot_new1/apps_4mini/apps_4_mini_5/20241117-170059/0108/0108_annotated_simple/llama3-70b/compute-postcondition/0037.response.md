Output State: **`res` contains all characters from `s`, each character replaced by the next one in the alphabet, maintaining their original count; `s` is modified accordingly; if `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` remains an empty string and `s` is unchanged. If `s` consists solely of characters that are not in the alphabet, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string.**
