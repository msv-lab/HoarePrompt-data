The variable `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The initial value of `res` is 'axz', and since `s` includes 'z', we can infer that `char` is likely 'z'. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will become 'axzz'. The state of the other variable `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is 'axzz', `s` is '{' and `s` includes 'z'**
