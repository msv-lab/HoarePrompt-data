Postcondition: ***`res` contains all characters from `s`, each character replaced by the next one in the alphabet, maintaining their original count; `s` is modified accordingly; `res` is not equal to 26 characters, indicating that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` remains an empty string and `s` is unchanged.***
