The variable `s` contains the string 'a', `res` is the string of 'a's followed by 'z', which is 'az', and `char` is 'z'. The code `s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)` attempts to replace the first occurrence of `char` ('z') in `s` with the character that comes after 'z' in the Unicode table, which is '{' (since `ord('z')` is 122, and `ord('z') + 1` is 123). 

However, since `s` is 'a' and does not contain 'z', the `replace` function will not change `s`. Therefore, `s` remains 'a', and the other variables are unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is 'a', `res` is 'az', `char` is 'z'**
