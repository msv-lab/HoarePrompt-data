The function reads a string input consisting of lowercase English letters. It constructs a new string by replacing each character in the input with the next character in the alphabet, maintaining the original count of each character. If the resulting string contains exactly 26 characters (indicating that all letters from 'a' to 'z' were present in the input), it prints the resulting string. If the input does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', or if it contains no valid characters, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters.
