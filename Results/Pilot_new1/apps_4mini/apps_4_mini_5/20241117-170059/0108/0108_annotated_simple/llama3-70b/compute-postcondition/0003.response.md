According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `alphabet`, which consists of the lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'. The loop will execute regardless of the contents of the string `s` or the initial value of `res`, as it is solely dependent on the fixed string `alphabet`. 

Since the loop will execute for each character in `alphabet`, we need to set the initial state of `char` to the first character in `alphabet`, which is 'a'. The other variables (`s` and `res`) do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is '', `char` is 'a'**
