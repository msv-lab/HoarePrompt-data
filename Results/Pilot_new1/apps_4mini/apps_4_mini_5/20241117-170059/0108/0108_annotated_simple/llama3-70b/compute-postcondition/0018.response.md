The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'az' and the value of `char` is 'a'. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will be 'aza'. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'a', `res` is 'aza', `char` is 'a'**
