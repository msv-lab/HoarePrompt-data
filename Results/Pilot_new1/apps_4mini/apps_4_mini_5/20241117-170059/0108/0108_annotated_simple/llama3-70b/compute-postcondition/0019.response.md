The `replace` method is called on the string `s`, which is currently 'a'. The method will replace the first occurrence of the character `char`, which is also 'a', with the character obtained from `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The `ord` function returns the Unicode code point of 'a', which is 97. Adding 1 gives us 98, and `chr(98)` returns 'b'. Therefore, the first occurrence of 'a' in `s` will be replaced with 'b'. 

After this operation, `s` will change from 'a' to 'b'. The other variables `res` and `char` remain unchanged. 

Thus, the output state is: `s` is 'b', `res` is 'aza', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is 'aza', `char` is 'a'**
