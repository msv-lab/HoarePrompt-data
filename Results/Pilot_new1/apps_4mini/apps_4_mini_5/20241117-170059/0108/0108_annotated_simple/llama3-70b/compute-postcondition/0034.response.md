According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is 'z' and `s` is '{'. Since 'z' is not present in the string '{', the loop cannot execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` would need to include 'z'. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `s` to include 'z'. 

State: **`res` is 'axzzz', `s` is '{z}', `char` is 'z'**
