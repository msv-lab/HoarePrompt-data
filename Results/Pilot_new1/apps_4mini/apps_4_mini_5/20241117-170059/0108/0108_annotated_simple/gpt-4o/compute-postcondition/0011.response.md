The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`s`, `j`, `len(s)`, `target`, and `target_len`) are not affected. Consequently, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `len(s)` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `j` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, and `len(s)` is greater than 1**
