The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, which calculates the length of the string `target`. The string `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which consists of 26 lowercase English letters. Therefore, `target_len` will be assigned the value 26. The state of the other variable `s` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**
