The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown. The other variables `s`, `j`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, and `target_len` is greater than 1; `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, `target_len` is greater than 1; `i` is increased by 1**
