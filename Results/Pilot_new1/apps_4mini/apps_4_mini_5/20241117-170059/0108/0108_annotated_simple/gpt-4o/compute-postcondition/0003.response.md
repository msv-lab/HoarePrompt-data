The variables `i` and `j` are both assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
