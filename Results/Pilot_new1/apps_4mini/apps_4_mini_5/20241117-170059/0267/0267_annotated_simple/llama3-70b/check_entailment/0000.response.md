To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we will analyze the code and its logic.

The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits and then printing this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function calls the `count` function for both `r` and `l - 1`, then calculates the difference and takes modulo `MOD` (which is presumably `998244353`).
   - The logic appears to be correct in terms of calculating the sum by using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - The function checks if `k` is `0`, returning `0` if true. This is correct since no numbers can be formed with `0` different digits.
   - It uses memoization (`dp`) to store already computed results for `(n, k)`.
   - The logic for calculating how many numbers can be formed with at most `k` different digits is complex but seems to follow a pattern based on powers of 10 and combinations of digits.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `k` is `0` correctly in the context of the problem description. While it returns `0` for `k == 0`, the problem states `1 <= k`, so this case should not occur.
   - The program may not correctly handle cases where `l` and `r` are very close to each other, especially if they are at the limits of the range (e.g., `l = 999999999999999999`, `r = 1000000000000000000`), although the logic seems to account for large values.

2. **Summation Logic**:
   - The core logic for summing numbers with at most `k` different digits is not explicitly clear and may fail for specific patterns of numbers, especially when the range contains numbers with varying digits. For example, numbers like `101`, `110`, `111`, etc., may not be correctly counted if the logic does not capture all valid combinations.

### Conclusion

While the program has a structured approach to solving the problem, there are potential edge cases that it does not handle correctly, particularly in the way it calculates the valid numbers based on the digit constraints. Given that the program must be correct for all potential cases and the complexity of the counting logic, I believe the program may fail to correctly compute the sum for certain ranges.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure
For an input such as `l = 100`, `r = 150`, `k = 2`, the expected output should include numbers like `101`, `110`, `111`, `112`, etc. If the counting logic fails to capture all these combinations due to improper handling of digits, the output will be incorrect.
