The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Given that `total_sum` is initially 0 and `num` is equal to `l + 2`, the new value of `total_sum` becomes `(0 + (l + 2)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 2) % MOD`. The value of `MOD` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `total_sum` after the operation, but we can express it in terms of `l` and `MOD`.

Since the other variables (`l`, `r`, and `num`) remain unchanged, the output state will reflect the new value of `total_sum` as well as the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`total_sum` is (l + 2) % MOD, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that r >= l + 2, `num` is equal to l + 2**
