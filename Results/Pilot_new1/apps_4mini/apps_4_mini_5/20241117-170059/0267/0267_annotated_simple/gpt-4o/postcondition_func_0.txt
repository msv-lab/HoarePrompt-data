The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer) and `k` (an integer), and returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of unique digits in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. There are no checks for the range of `n`, so it can handle negative integers, which may include a negative sign as a character, but this is not accounted for in the unique digit count.
