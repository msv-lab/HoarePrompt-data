According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to the next integer value. Since `l` is the starting point, the next value for `num` will be `l + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `num` must still be less than or equal to `r`.

Given that `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\) and since `num` is equal to `l`, the new state should reflect that `num` is now `l + 1`. 

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is equal to `l + 1`**
