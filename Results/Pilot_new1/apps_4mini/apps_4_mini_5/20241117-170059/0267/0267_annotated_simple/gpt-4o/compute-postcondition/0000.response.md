The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `l`, `r`, and `k` is not affected by this assignment, as they retain their respective values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `total_sum` has been set to 0, while `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0**
