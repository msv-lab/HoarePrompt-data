Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is 0, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `num` is equal to `l + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is updated to `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, `total_sum` remains 0.***
