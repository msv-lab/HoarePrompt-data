The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l + 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `total_sum` becomes `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`total_sum` is (l + 1) % MOD, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is equal to l + 1**
