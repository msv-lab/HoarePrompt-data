According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `i` is less than `k`. In the previous iteration, `i` must be less than `k` for the loop to have executed. Since `k` is an integer such that `k >= 3`, the maximum value of `i` at the end of the last iteration can be `k - 1`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to `k - 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `l`, `r`, `n`, and `dp[n, k]` do not affect the loop's execution in this case.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` >= 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is initially 90, but the final value of `dp[n, k]` cannot be determined without knowing `i`, `i` is `k - 1`**
