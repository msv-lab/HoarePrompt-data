According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k`, which means that `k` must be greater than 1 to allow for at least one iteration. 

Since `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the expression involving `k` and `i`, we do not need to change `dp[n, k]` for the next iteration, as it will be updated in the loop body. 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`, which must now be equal to `k`. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is initially 90, `i` is k, `k` is greater than 1**
