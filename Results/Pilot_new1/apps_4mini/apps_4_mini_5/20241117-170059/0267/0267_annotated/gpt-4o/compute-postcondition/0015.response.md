Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` defining a range, and an integer `k`. It calculates and returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true, applying a modulo operation with `MOD` on the total sum. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0, and if no integers in the range satisfy the condition, it also returns 0. **
