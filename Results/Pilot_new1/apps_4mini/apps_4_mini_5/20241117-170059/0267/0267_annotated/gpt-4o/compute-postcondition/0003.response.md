The variable `total_sum` is updated with the expression `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, the calculation becomes `(0 + l) % MOD`, which is simply `l % MOD`. The value of `total_sum` is now `l % MOD`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`, and the result of func_1(num, k) is true.**
