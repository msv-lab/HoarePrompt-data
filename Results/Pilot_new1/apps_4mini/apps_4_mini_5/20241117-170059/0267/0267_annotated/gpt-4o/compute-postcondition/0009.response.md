To determine the impact of the code snippet, we need to analyze the variables involved. The code line `total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD` updates the value of `total_sum`. 

1. The initial state indicates `total_sum` is 0.
2. The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, so its value is unknown.
3. The operation adds `num` to `total_sum` and then takes the modulus with `MOD`. However, since `total_sum` starts at 0, the equation simplifies to `total_sum = num % MOD`.

Since we don't have a specific value for `num` or `MOD`, we cannot definitively calculate the new value of `total_sum`. Therefore, we can only state that `total_sum` is updated based on `num`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to `l + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to (0 + num) % MOD**
