The line of code updates `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `total_sum` is updated based on its previous value and the value of `num`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `total_sum`, `num`, or `MOD`, the output state will reflect the update without specific numerical values.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is at least `r + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD**
