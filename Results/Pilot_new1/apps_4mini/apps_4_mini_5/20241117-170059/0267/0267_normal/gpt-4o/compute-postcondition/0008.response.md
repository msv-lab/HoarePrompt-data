According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute as long as `num` is within the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num` would have been equal to `r` during the last execution of the loop. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `num` needs to be `r + 1`, which is outside the range, and the loop cannot execute again.

Since `l`, `r`, and `k` are unchanged, and the loop cannot execute again based on the current values, there are no adjustments needed to those states. 

However, if we want to prepare for a hypothetical next iteration where the loop could execute again, we would need to adjust `r` to be at least `r + 1` to allow for another iteration. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `r` is at least `r + 1` for the loop to potentially execute again.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is at least `r + 1`, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is unchanged**
