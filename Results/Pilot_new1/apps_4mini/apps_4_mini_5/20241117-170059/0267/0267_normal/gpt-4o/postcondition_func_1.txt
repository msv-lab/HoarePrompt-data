The function accepts three parameters, `l`, `r`, and `k`, and calculates the sum of all integers in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true. This sum is then taken modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. If `l` equals `r`, it returns the value based on whether `func_1(l, k)` is true or false. The function does not handle cases where `MOD` might be undefined or zero, which could lead to potential errors.
