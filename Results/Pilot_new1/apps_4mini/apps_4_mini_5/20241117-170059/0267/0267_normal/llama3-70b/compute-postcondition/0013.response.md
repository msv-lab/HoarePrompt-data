The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated by the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `i` is 2, we can substitute this value into the expression.

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`: This is `10 ** (2 - 1) = 10 ** 1 = 10`.
2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`: This is `10 ** (k - 2)`.
3. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`: This is already calculated as `10`.
4. Now substitute these into the expression: 
   - `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`

Thus, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the above calculations. The other variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated, `i` is 2, and `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 * (10 ** (k - 2) - 10)`**.
