Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is set to `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, and if `k` is at least 2, then `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculations involving `n` and `k`, and the result is taken modulo `MOD`. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is set to 9. The function does not return any value if `k` is greater than 0 and the pair (n, k) does not exist in the dp collection.***
