The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The initial state indicates that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0. This means that the conditions are satisfied for the print statement to be executed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not directly affected by the print statement. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; 'YES' is printed.**
