Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is zero (resulting in 'YES') and cases where `(b - a)` is negative (resulting in 'NO').***
