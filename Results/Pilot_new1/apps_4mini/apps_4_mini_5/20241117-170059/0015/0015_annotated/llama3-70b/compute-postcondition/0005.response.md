The code prints 'NO', which does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, where `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, `c` is 0, and `a` is not equal to `b`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, `c` is 0, and `a` is not equal to `b`, and 'NO' is printed.**
