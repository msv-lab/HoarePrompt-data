The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values based on the input received from the user, where `input()` takes a space-separated string of integers which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten, but since they are not specified, we cannot determine their new values. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers based on user input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input**
