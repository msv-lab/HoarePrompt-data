The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input; `a` and `b` are equal; `c` is 0; and 'YES' is printed.**
