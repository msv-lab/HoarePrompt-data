To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description, along with the annotations that describe the expected behavior of the program.

The problem description states that we need to check if a favorite integer `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference `c`. The sequence can be defined as:
- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \) for \( i \geq 1 \)

The program's output should be "YES" if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \), and "NO" otherwise.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Check if `b` equals `a`:** 
   - If `b` is equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "YES".
   
2. **Check if `c` equals `0`:**
   - If `c` is `0` and `b` is not equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "NO" because the sequence would be constant (all elements equal to `a`).
   
3. **When `c` is not `0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to determine if `b` can be reached by some term in the sequence.
   - It also checks `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the term index \( i \) is positive (i.e., \( i \) must be a positive integer).

### Edge Cases:
- If `c` is positive, the sequence increases, so we need to ensure that `b` is greater than or equal to `a` for it to be reachable.
- If `c` is negative, the sequence decreases, so we need to ensure that `b` is less than or equal to `a` for it to be reachable.
  
### Annotations:
The annotations clarify that if \( c \) is not equal to `0`, the program checks both conditions:
- Divisibility: `(b - a) % c == 0`
- Non-negativity: `(b - a) / c >= 0`

This ensures that the program correctly identifies whether `b` is part of the sequence based on the direction of the sequence (increasing or decreasing).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the logic as described in the problem statement and accounts for edge cases. I cannot identify any specific case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
