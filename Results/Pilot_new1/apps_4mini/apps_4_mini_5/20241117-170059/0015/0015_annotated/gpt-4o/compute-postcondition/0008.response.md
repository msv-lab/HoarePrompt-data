The code prints 'YES', which indicates a positive outcome based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but the output reflects the successful evaluation of the conditions. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with values from input, and the program prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with values from input, and the program prints 'YES'**
