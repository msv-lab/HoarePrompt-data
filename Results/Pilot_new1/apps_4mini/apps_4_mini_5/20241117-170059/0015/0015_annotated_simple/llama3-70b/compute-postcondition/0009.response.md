The code prints 'YES', and the initial conditions state that `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, with `c` not equal to 0, and the difference `b - a` being divisible by `c` with a non-negative result. The execution does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers; 'YES' has been printed**
