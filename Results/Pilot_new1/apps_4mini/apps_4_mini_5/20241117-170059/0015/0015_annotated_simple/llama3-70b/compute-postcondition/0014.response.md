The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that can range from -10^9 to 10^9. However, since the function does not take any input parameters, it does not return any output based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to not accept any parameters and not return any values based on `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.**
