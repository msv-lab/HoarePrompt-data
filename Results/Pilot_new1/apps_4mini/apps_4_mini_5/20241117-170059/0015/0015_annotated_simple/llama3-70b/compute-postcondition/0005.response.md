The code prints 'NO', which does not change the values of any variables. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, with `c` still equal to 0, and `a` and `b` being input integers that are not equal. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is 0, and the program prints 'NO'**
