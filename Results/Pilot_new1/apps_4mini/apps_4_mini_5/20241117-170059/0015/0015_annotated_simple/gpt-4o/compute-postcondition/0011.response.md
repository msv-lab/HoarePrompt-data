Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and `b` is not equal to `a`. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0, 'NO' is printed.***
