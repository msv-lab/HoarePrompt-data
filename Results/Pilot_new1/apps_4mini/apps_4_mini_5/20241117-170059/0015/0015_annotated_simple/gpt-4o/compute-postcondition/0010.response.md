The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation, and the conditions regarding their values remain valid. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `c` is not equal to 0, `b` is not equal to `a`, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0, and the output is 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, `c` is not equal to 0, `b` is not equal to `a`, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0, and the output is 'NO'**.
