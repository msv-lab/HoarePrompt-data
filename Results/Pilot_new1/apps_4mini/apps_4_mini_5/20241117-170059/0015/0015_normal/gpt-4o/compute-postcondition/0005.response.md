The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `b` is not equal to `a`; `c` is equal to 0; printed 'NO'**
