The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not altered by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed result.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new input integers. `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer; 'YES' is printed.**
