The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values based on user input. The `map(int, input().split())` function reads a line of input, splits it into separate values, and converts each value to an integer. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown since they are replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now assigned new input integers.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new input integers**
