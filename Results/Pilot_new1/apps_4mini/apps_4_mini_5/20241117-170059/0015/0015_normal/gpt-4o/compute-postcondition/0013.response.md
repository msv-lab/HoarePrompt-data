Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative quotient, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, including when `(b - a)` is negative and not divisible by `c`, or when `(b - a)` is positive but not divisible by `c`, 'NO' is printed.***
