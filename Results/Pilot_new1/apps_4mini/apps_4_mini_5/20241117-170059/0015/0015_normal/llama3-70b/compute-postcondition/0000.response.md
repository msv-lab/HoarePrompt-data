The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which are converted to integers. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are overwritten by the new input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now the integers from the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
