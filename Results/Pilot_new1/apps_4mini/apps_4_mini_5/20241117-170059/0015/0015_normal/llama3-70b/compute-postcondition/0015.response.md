Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. If `c` is 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This includes cases where `b` is equal to `a` (resulting in 0, which is non-negative and divisible by any non-zero `c`) and cases where `b` is less than `a` (resulting in a negative difference that is not non-negative).**
