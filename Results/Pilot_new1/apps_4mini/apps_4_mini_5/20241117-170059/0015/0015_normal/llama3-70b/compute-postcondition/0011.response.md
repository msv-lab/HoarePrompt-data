The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. The conditions specified in the initial state ensure that the print statement is executed. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed message.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers; the output is 'NO'**
