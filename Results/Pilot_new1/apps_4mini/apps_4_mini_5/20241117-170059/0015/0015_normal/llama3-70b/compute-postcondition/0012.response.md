Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers with `c` not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the division result `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'. This includes cases where `b` is equal to `a` (resulting in 0, which is non-negative and divisible by any non-zero `c`) and cases where `b` is less than `a` (resulting in a negative difference that is not non-negative).***
