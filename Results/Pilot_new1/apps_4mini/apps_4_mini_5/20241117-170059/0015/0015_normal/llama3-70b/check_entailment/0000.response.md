To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine if a favorite integer `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
- The first element of the sequence is `a` (i.e., \( s_1 = a \)).
- The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c` (i.e., \( s_{i} - s_{i-1} = c \)).

The sequence can be expressed as:
- \( s_i = a + (i - 1) \cdot c \)

We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Code Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - If `a == b`, it prints 'YES' (correct, since all elements are `a`).
   - If `a != b`, it prints 'NO' (correct, since all elements are `a`).

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - It checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (to ensure that `b` can be reached from `a` by stepping through multiples of `c`).
   - It checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` (to ensure that the steps taken do not go backwards in the sequence).

### Edge Case Consideration:
- If `c > 0`, the sequence will be strictly increasing.
- If `c < 0`, the sequence will be strictly decreasing.
- If `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive, it should return 'NO'.
- If `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is negative, it should return 'NO'.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints correctly summarize the logic of the code:
- When `c` is 0, it correctly identifies if `a` equals `b`.
- When `c` is not 0, it checks both conditions for divisibility and non-negativity.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to handle all specified cases correctly according to the problem description. 

- For `c = 0`, it correctly identifies if `b` is equal to `a`.
- For `c > 0`, it ensures `b` can be reached from `a` and checks that the steps do not lead to negative indices.
- For `c < 0`, it also correctly checks the conditions.

Since I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected based on the description and hints, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
