The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function may operate on internally defined variables or constants. However, since no specific output or behavior is described in the output section, we cannot determine the functionality of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its functionality is currently undefined as no output behavior is described.**
