The code prints the string '0'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the value of `x` is equal to `y`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; and `z` is equal to 0. The function prints '0'.
