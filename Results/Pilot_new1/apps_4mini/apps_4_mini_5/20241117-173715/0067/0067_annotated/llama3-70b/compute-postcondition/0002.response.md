The `print('+')` statement outputs the character `+`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and since `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output will simply be a printed `+`. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is `+`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is `+`**
