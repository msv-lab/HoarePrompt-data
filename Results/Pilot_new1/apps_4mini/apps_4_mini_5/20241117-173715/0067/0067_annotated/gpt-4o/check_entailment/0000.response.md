To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
Nauuo receives votes from three groups:
- `x`: Known upvotes
- `y`: Known downvotes
- `z`: Unknown votes (could be either upvotes or downvotes)

The output should be:
- "+" if upvotes are definitively greater than downvotes
- "-" if downvotes are definitively greater than upvotes
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes
- "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Analyzing the Code
The code calculates:
- `min_upvotes = x`
- `max_upvotes = x + z`
- `min_downvotes = y`
- `max_downvotes = y + z`

Then it checks:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `-`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `+`.
3. Otherwise, it prints `?`.

### Edge Cases
1. **Case when `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`:**
   - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The result can be "+" if the unknown votes upvote, or "-" if they downvote. Thus, the output should be "?".
   - The code correctly outputs "?" in this case.

2. **Case when `x = 3`, `y = 7`, and `z = 0`:**
   - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
   - The result is definitively "-", which the code correctly outputs.

3. **Case when `x = 2`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`:**
   - `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The result can only be "+", which the code correctly outputs.

4. **Case when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`:**
   - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
   - The result is definitively "0", which the code correctly outputs.

### Conclusion
The code covers all potential scenarios as outlined in the problem description. The checks for maximum and minimum upvotes and downvotes ensure that all edge cases are handled correctly. The annotations align with the logic of the code and validate that the program behaves as expected for all provided examples.

Thus, after thorough examination, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
