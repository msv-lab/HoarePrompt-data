Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` (which is equal to `x`), the output is '+'. Otherwise, the output is '?', indicating that `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` and within the range defined by `min_downvotes` and `max_upvotes`.***
