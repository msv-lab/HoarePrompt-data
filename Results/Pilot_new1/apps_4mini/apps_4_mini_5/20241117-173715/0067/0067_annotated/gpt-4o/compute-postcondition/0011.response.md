The code snippet `print('?')` outputs a question mark. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is an integer between 0 and 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is an integer between `min_upvotes` and 200, and `max_upvotes` is larger than or equal to `min_downvotes`, and the output is '?'**
