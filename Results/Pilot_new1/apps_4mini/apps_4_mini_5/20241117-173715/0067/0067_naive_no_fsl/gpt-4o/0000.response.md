Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all cases correctly as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal, and the presence of `z` unknown votes could lead to different outcomes.

For instance, consider the input:
```
0 0 1
```
In this case, the program would output `?`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `?` because with one unknown voter, they could either upvote or downvote, leading to both `+` and `-` outcomes being possible.

Moreover, the program also does not correctly identify the situation when the total upvotes and downvotes are equal, and there are unknown votes. For example:
```
1 1 1
```
In this case, the output should be `?` since the unknown voter can either change the result to `+` or `-`.

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
