Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the output is '0'; otherwise, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the output is '?', since `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, ensuring that `x` is non-negative when `z` is zero.***
