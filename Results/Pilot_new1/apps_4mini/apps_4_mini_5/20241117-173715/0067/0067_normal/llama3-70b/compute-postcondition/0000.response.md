The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the split input string into integers. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unknown, as they are not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` will now hold new integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on input**
