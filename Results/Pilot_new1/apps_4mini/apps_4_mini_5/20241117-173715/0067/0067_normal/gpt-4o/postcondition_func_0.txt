The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` via standard input, representing the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes. It calculates the maximum possible upvotes as `x + z` and the maximum possible downvotes as `y + z`. The function then prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met. This covers all relationships between upvotes and downvotes based on the provided input.
