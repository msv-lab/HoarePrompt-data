The value of `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `min_upvotes` and the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned integer values from input, where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`**
