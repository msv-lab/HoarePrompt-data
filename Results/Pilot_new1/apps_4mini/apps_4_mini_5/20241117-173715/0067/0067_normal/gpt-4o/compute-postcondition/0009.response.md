The code executes a print statement that outputs a plus sign (`+`). The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are input integers; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; the function prints '+'**
