Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are input integers. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is `y`), the program prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'. This ensures that all relationships between upvotes and downvotes are considered, specifically covering the edge cases where the maximum upvotes are insufficient compared to the minimum downvotes, or the maximum downvotes are insufficient compared to the minimum upvotes.***
