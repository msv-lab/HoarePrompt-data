The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y` (an input integer) and `z` (an input integer). Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be equal to the sum of these two input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
