The code executes a print statement that outputs a single hyphen ('-'). The values of the variables are not changed or affected by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`; and a hyphen ('-') is printed.**
