The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, which is an integer between 0 and 100. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (an integer between 0 and 100), `y` (an integer between 0 and 100), and `z` (an integer between 0 and 100). The other variables `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer between 0 and 100, `y` is an integer between 0 and 100, `z` is an integer between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`.**
