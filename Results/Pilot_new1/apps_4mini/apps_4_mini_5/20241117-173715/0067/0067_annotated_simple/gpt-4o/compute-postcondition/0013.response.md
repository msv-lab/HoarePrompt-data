Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is `y`), a hyphen ('-') is printed. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), a plus sign ('+') is printed. Otherwise, if neither of these conditions is met, a question mark ('?') is printed, indicating that the upvotes and downvotes are in a non-dominating relationship. This ensures that all possible relationships between upvotes and downvotes are addressed.***
