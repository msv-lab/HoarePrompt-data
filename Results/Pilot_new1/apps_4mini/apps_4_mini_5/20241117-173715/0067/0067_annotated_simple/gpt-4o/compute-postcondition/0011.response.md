The code executes a `print` statement that outputs a question mark. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, `z`, `max_upvotes`, `min_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial state. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (which is `y`); `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; and `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is greater than or equal to `x`, and the output is '?'**
