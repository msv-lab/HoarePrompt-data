The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
