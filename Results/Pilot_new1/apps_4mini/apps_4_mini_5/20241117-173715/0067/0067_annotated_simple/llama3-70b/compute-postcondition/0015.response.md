Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, the function prints '0'. If `z` is greater than 0, the function prints '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the function prints '?'. In all cases, `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.***
