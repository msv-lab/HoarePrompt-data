Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range 0 to 100. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen ('-') is printed. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y`, '?' is printed. In all cases, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).***
