To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

The problem states that we need to determine the voting result based on three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). The output should be:
- "+" if upvotes are greater than downvotes in all scenarios,
- "-" if downvotes are greater than upvotes in all scenarios,
- "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal in all scenarios,
- "?" if the result is uncertain due to the presence of unknown votes.

The provided program calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes considering the unknown votes (`z`):

1. `min_upvotes = x` (the minimum upvotes is the known upvotes)
2. `max_upvotes = x + z` (the maximum upvotes is all unknown votes being upvotes)
3. `min_downvotes = y` (the minimum downvotes is the known downvotes)
4. `max_downvotes = y + z` (the maximum downvotes is all unknown votes being downvotes)

Then the program checks:
- If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), then it prints "-".
- If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), then it prints "+".
- If neither of the above conditions is satisfied, it prints "?" indicating uncertainty.

Let's consider the edge cases:
- **Case 1:** `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The possible outcomes are:
    - If the unknown vote is an upvote, the result is "+".
    - If the unknown vote is a downvote, the result is "-".
  - Therefore, the output should be "?", but the program correctly outputs "?".
  
- **Case 2:** `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The possible outcomes are:
    - Always more upvotes than downvotes: output should be "+".
  - The program correctly outputs "+".

- **Case 3:** `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`.
  - The outcome is equal: output should be "0".
  - The program correctly outputs "0".

- **Case 4:** `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`
  - Here, `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`.
  - The outcome is clear that downvotes exceed upvotes: output should be "-".
  - The program correctly outputs "-".

After evaluating these cases, we observe that the program handles all specified conditions correctly and produces the expected results for every possible scenario described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**.
