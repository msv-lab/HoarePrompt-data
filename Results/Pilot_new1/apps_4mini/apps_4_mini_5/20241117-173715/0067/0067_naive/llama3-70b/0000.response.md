To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and consider potential edge cases.

The problem states that we need to determine the voting outcome based on three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). The program should return:
- "+" if upvotes are greater than downvotes in all scenarios,
- "-" if downvotes are greater than upvotes in all scenarios,
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown votes,
- "?" if the outcome is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

Now, let's break down the program:

```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Analysis:

1. **Case: Upvotes are definitely greater than downvotes**
   - If `x > y + z`, it correctly prints "+".

2. **Case: Downvotes are definitely greater than upvotes**
   - If `x < y`, it correctly prints "-".

3. **Case: Upvotes equal downvotes**
   - If `x == y`:
     - If `z == 0`, it correctly prints "0".
     - If `z > 0`, it correctly prints "?" because the unknown votes can lead to either side winning.

4. **Case: Upvotes are less than or equal to downvotes but not covered by previous conditions**
   - This is handled by the final `else` which will print "?" if `x <= y + z` and `x != y`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** When `x = 0`, `y = 0`, and `z = 1`. The program should return "?" since the unknown vote can lead to either "+" or "-".
- **Case 2:** When `x = 0`, `y = 1`, and `z = 0`. The program should return "-" since there are no unknown votes and downvotes are greater.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all the specified cases correctly according to the problem description. There are no scenarios where it would produce an incorrect result based on the inputs provided.

Correctness: **True**.
