According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `chars`. The loop iterates over all permutations of `chars`. Since `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more permutation left to generate.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` represents the current permutation of `chars`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more permutations available. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that there are still more permutations to be considered.

Since we do not have information on the specific number of permutations generated so far or the current state of `perm`, we can only state that `perm` must change to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations of `chars`.

Thus, the adjusted state should indicate that `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and we need to ensure that `chars` remains the same.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`**
