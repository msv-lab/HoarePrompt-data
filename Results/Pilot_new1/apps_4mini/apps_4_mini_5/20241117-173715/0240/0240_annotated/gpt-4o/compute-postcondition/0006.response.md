The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it will be a string created by joining the elements of the iterable `perm`. The previous state of `perm` is not specified, but it is the next permutation of `chars`. The variable `chars` remains unchanged, and `sub` is also unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `candidate` based on the current value of `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
