The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and the parameter `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars` which can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it generates and returns a list of possible numbers that can be formed by inserting `sub` into `chars` at various positions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `generate_possible_numbers` is to accept a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and return a list of possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string of digits `chars` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and returns a list of possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars`.**
