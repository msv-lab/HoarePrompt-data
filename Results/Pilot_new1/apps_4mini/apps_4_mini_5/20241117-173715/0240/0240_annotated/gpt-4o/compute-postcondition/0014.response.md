Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring. The loop generates all permutations of `chars`, and for each permutation, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `chars` is an empty string or has leading zeroes that make `sub` invalid, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `sub` cannot be matched with any permutation of `chars`, no candidates are yielded after all permutations are evaluated.**
