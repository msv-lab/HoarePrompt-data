To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze the requirements carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We are given a string `s` which is a shuffled version of a very large integer `n` appended with the number of digits in `n`.
2. We are also given a non-empty substring `t` of `n`.
3. The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from `s` and `t`.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s, t)` performs the following steps:
- It initializes an empty string `n`.
- It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
- If `c` is found in the set of characters from the substring `t`, it appends `c` to `n`.
- Finally, it appends the entire substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations explain that:
- The string `n` is constructed from characters in `s` that are also in `t`.
- After forming `n` from `s`, `t` is appended to `n`.
- The final result is converted to an integer.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. **Leading Zeros**: If `s` contains leading zeros, the way `n` is constructed may lead to an incorrect integer representation.
2. **Character Filtering**: The program only includes characters from `s` that are in `t`. This might not always yield the smallest `n` because it may miss valid digits that could result in a smaller number.
3. **No Characters in Common**: If `s` contains no characters that match `t`, `n` will only consist of `t`, which might not be valid based on the problem statement since it requires constructing the smallest `n` using digits from both `s` and `t`.

### Example Analysis:
Using the provided examples:
- For input `003512` and `021`, the output is `30021`. This is correct because it uses available digits from `s` and appends `t` properly.
- For input `199966633300` and `63`, the output is `3036366999`, which is also correct.

### Issue Identification:
However, consider the case:
- If `s = "0000"` and `t = "0"`, the program would return `0` because `n` would be constructed as `t` only. However, the smallest valid `n` should be `0`, but if `t` were something like `01`, the program would not be able to construct a valid `n` since it ignores valid digits from `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly when there are leading zeros or when the digits in `s` do not contribute to a valid construction of `n`. 

Thus, the program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
