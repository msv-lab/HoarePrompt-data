Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` by including only the characters from `s` that are also found in `t`, and then appends the entire string `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string `n`. If `s` is empty or if none of its characters are in `t`, and `t` is also empty, the function will return 0, as `n` will be just `t` converted to an integer. If `t` contains non-numeric characters, it will raise a ValueError during the conversion to integer.**
