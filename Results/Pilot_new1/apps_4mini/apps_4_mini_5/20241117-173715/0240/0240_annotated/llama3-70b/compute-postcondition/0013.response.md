Output State: **`n` is a string composed of the characters from `s` that are also present in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If `t_set` is empty, the loop will also not execute and `n` will be an empty string. If `s` contains characters not in `t_set`, those characters will be ignored and `n` will only contain the characters from `s` that are in `t_set`.**
