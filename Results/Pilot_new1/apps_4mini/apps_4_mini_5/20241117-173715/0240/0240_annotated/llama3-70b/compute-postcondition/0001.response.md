The variable `n` is assigned an empty string. The initial states of `s` and `t_set` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` while maintaining the previous values of `s` and `t_set`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`; `n` is an empty string**
