The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of the list `perm` into a single string. The value of `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `chars` is a non-empty string of digits. Therefore, `candidate` will now hold the string representation of the next permutation of `chars`. The values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string representation of the next permutation of `chars`**
