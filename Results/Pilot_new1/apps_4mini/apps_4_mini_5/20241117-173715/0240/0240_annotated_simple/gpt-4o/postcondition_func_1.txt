The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str` and the length of `num_str` matches the length of `sub`. However, the function references `n_len`, which is not defined in the provided code, leading to a potential error. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the intended behavior, as it will raise a NameError due to the undefined variable `n_len`.
