The variable `candidate` is assigned the value obtained by joining the elements of `perm`, which is equal to `chars`. Since `perm` is equal to `chars`, `candidate` will be a string formed by the concatenation of the characters in `chars`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `chars`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is `chars`, and `candidate` is `chars`**
