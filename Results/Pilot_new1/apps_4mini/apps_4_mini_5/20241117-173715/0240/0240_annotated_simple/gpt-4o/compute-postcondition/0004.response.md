Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is equal to `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, there is no yield, and the state remains unchanged with respect to `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate`.***
