The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty string `t` of digits. It constructs a new string `n` that includes only the characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, and then concatenates `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of this concatenated string. If `s` is empty or if none of its characters are in `t`, `n` will only contain the digits from `t`. The function may raise a ValueError if the concatenated result is not a valid integer representation (for example, if `t` contains non-digit characters).
