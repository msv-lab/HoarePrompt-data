According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` variable. The `permutations` function will generate permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character since `permutations` of an empty string would result in no iterations.

Given that `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it is guaranteed to have at least one character (since it is not empty). The variable `perm` will take on the permutations of the characters in `chars`, starting from the first permutation.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
