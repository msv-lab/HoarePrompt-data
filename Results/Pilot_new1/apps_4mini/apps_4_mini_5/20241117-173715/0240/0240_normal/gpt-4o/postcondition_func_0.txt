The function accepts a string `s` of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It calculates the character counts of `s` after removing the counts of characters found in `sub`. It then generates a list of possible numbers from the remaining characters in `s` and returns the smallest integer value from that list. If `sub` contains characters not present in `s`, those characters will not affect the resulting possible numbers. Additionally, if no valid numbers can be generated from the remaining characters, the behavior of the function is not defined in the annotations.
