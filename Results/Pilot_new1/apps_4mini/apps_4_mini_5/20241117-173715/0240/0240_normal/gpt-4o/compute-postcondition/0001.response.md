`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the permutation `perm` into a single string. The value of `perm` is derived from `chars`, which is a string of digits. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string formed by the first permutation of `chars`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**.
