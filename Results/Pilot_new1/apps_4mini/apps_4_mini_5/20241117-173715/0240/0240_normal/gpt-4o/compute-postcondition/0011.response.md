The code snippet executes a `yield` statement, which produces a value to be returned from a generator function without terminating it. The variable `candidate` is yielded, which is the string formed by joining `perm`. The previous states of the variables are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate`, along with the yielded value.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
