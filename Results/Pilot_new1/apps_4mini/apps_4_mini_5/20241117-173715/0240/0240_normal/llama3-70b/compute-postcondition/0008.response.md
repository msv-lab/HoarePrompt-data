Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of digits with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty string of digits, and `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated by adding `c` to its value; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.***
