The variable `n` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty string of digits which may contain leading zeroes; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.
