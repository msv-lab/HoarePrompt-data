To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya writes a large integer `n` as a string and appends the number of digits in `n` (let's call this `k`). The string received by Kate has all digits shuffled. We need to find the smallest possible integer `n` that Vasya could have passed, knowing a non-empty substring of `n`.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads two strings: `s` (the shuffled string) and `t` (the remembered substring). The function `func_1` creates a new string `n` by:
1. Collecting characters from `s` that are also in `t`.
2. Appending `t` to this collected string.
3. Converting this combined string to an integer and returning it.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Not Handling Leading Zeros Properly**: The program collects characters from `s` that are in `t`, but it does not ensure that the resulting number does not have leading zeros (except for the case when `n` is zero). For example, if `s` is "003512" and `t` is "021", the program would produce "30021". However, if `s` were "000123" and `t` were "01", the program would produce "3001", which is not the smallest possible integer representation of `n` (it should have been "1001").
   
2. **Incorrect Order of Digits**: The program does not guarantee that the digits from `s` are in the correct order relative to how they could appear in `n`. The smallest integer `n` should be formed by considering the digits in their original order while ensuring the substring `t` is correctly placed.

3. **Missing Digits**: The program only collects digits from `s` that are present in `t`, which may omit necessary digits required to form the smallest possible `n`.

### Example to Demonstrate Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
s = "000123"
t = "01"
```
The expected output should be `1001` (the smallest integer `n`), but the program would output `3001`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle cases of leading zeros and the ordering of digits, it fails to meet the problem requirements in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**.
