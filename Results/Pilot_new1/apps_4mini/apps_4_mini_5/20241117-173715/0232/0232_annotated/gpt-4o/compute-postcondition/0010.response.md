Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 to `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is between 1 and `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, and `current_counts` has been updated with the count of `colors[right]` increased by 1. If all counts in `current_counts` are equal to their corresponding desired counts in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, indicating that not all color counts meet the desired criteria.***
