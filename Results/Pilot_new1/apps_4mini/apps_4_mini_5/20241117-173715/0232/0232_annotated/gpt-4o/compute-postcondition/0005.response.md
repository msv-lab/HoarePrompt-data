Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 100, `m` is an integer in the range 1 to `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is between 1 and `n`, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` is updated with the count of `colors[right]` increased by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and for every color in `desired_counts`, the count of that color in `current_counts` is equal to the corresponding value in `desired_counts`.***
