Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the count of each color encountered in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`. All counts in `window_counts` (sorted) match the corresponding values in `counts`, and `found` is set to True. If `n` is equal to or less than `i`, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains False, and `i` and `j` remain unchanged.***
