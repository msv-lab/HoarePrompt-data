Output State: **`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to (but not including) index `n`. If `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, it has a value of 1; otherwise, its value is incremented by 1. If the sorted values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` remains True, and `i` and `n` remain unchanged. If the loop executes but the condition is never met, `found` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is still greater than `i`.**
