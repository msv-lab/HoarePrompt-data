Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to (but not including) index `n`, `found` is True, and the loop has exited. If `n` was greater than `i`, `i` and `n` remain unchanged. If the loop did not execute, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is True, and `i` and `n` remain unchanged.***
