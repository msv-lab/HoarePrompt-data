The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts[color]` is now 2, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
