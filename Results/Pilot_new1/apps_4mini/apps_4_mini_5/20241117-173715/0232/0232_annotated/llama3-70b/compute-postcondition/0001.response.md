The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split into parts. The input will provide a sequence of integers that will populate the list. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly changed by this code, but they determine the constraints on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `colors` is now a list of integers derived from the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers derived from input**.
