Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `window_counts` includes `color: 0` if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, otherwise `window_counts` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `j` are unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
