The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (which are split into individual strings) to integers. The initial state does not provide specific values for `colors` or the input, so we cannot determine the exact contents of `counts`. However, we know that `counts` will be a list of integers based on the input provided. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers derived from input, and `counts` is a list of integers from input.**
