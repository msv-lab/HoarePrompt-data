Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts` in terms of frequency, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. This means that if the condition is satisfied, the program indicates a successful match by setting `found` to True; otherwise, it continues execution without any changes to `found`.***
