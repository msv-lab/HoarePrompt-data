Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts` will contain the key `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`.***
