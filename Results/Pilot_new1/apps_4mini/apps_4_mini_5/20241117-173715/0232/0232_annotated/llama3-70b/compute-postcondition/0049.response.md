Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. During each iteration, `window_counts` is updated with the count of colors from the `colors` list, and `j` increments accordingly. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match `counts` at any point, `found` is set to True, and the loop exits. If `n` is 0 or if there are no colors in the `colors` list, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` remains False, `i` is still 0, and `n` is still 0 or greater.**
