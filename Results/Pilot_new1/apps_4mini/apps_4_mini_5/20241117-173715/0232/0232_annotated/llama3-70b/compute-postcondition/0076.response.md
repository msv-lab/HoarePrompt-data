Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1, `found` is False, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is initialized to 0; otherwise, the existing count for `color` remains unchanged.***
