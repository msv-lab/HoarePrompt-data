Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `right` is 0, `left` is 0, and at least one `current_counts[color]` is equal to or greater than `desired_counts[color]`. If all values in `current_counts` match their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If not all values match, the function does not return anything.***
