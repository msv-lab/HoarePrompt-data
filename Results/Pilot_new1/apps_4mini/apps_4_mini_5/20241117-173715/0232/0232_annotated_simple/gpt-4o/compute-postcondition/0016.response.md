To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information carefully.

1. The loop is controlled by the variable `right`, which iterates over a range defined by `n`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`.
3. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute at all.
4. If `n` is greater than 100, it is outside the defined range, which may lead to unexpected behavior, but the loop will still attempt to execute.
5. Each iteration of the loop will increment `right` by 1.

Given that we need to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `right` is less than `n` at the start of the next iteration. 

Assuming that at the end of the last iteration, `right` is currently at some value (let's denote it as `right = k`), we can deduce the following:

- For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than `n`. Thus, we need to ensure that `k` remains less than `n` after the current iteration.
- If the loop has executed `k` times already, then `right` would be `k` at the end of the last iteration, and for the next iteration, it will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment to ensure the loop can execute again is to ensure that `n` is greater than `k + 1`.

Thus, the state should reflect that `n` is greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`current_counts` match the corresponding `desired_counts`, `n` is greater than `k + 1`**
