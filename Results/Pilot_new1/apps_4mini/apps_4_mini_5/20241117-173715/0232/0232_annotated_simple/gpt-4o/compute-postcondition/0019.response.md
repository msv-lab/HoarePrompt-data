The value of `current_counts` is updated for the color at the index `right`. The specific color at `colors[right]` is incremented by 1 in `current_counts`. The variable `right` is then incremented by 1, but the value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated counts for the specific color as well as the incremented value of `right`.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated for the color at index `right`, `right` is `right + 1`, `n` is unchanged**
