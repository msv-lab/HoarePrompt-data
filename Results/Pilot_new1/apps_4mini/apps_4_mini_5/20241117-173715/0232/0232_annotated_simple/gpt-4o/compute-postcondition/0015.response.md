Output State: **If all `current_counts[color]` match the corresponding `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES' and the loop does not execute. If `current_counts` does not meet the conditions, the loop will execute until at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`, incrementing `left` each time. After the loop, `left` will be incremented by the number of iterations, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` will be decremented accordingly. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and all counts remain unchanged. If `n` is greater than 100, it is outside the defined range, but the loop structure does not handle this case, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.**
