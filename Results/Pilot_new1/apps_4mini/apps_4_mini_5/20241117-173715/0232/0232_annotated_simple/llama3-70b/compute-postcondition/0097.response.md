Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, meaning the counts of colors in the window are exactly as required. If this condition is satisfied, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the values of `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `color` remain unchanged, with `window_counts[color]` reflecting the appropriate count increment if `color` was previously present.***
