Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers from input, and `color` is the first element in `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts` will include `color` as a key with a value of 0; otherwise, `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
