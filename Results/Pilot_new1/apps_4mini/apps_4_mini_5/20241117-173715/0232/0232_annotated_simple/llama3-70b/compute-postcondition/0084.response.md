Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is between 0 and `n-1`, `color` is assigned a value from `colors` based on the current value of `j`, `window_counts` contains the counts of each color encountered in the range from `i` to `n-1,` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
