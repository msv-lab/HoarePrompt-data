Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, and `color` is the first element in `colors`, which is not a key in `color_counts`.***
