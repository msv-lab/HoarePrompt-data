Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is updated to either 1 or the previous value plus 1, and the counts of `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values after being sorted, resulting in a successful condition check that leads to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the values of `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `color`, and `window_counts` remain unchanged.***
