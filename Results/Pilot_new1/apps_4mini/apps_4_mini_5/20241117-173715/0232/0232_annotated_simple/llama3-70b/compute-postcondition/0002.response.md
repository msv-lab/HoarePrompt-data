The variable `counts` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take a space-separated input of integers, convert each of them to an integer using `int`, and then store them in the list `counts`. The previous state of the variable `counts` is not defined, but it will now contain the integers provided as input. The other variables (`n`, `m`, and `colors`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input; `counts` is a list of integers from input.**
