Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts[color]` is updated to 1 or incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no changes are made to `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, or `window_counts`.***
