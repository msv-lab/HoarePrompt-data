Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `color` is assigned a value from `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is updated to either 1 or the previous value plus 1, and the counts of `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values after being sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
