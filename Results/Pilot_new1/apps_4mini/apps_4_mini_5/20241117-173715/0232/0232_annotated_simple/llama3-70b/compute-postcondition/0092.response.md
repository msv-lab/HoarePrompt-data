Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `color` is undefined. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` now contains `color` as a key with a value of 0. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, then the state of `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
