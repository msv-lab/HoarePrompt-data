Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is at least 3; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements; `color` is the third element in `colors`; `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, which may initialize to 1 if `color` was not previously a key in `color_counts`.**
