Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, and `color` is the third element in `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
