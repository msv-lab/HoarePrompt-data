Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors from 1 to m to their corresponding values in k, and `current_counts` is updated with the count of the color at index `right`. If all counts in `current_counts` match their corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
