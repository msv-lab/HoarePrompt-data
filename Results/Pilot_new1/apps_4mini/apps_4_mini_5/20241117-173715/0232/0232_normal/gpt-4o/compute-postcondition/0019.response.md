The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. Since `right` is 1, the color at index 1 of the `colors` array is used to determine which count in `current_counts` is updated. The states of `desired_counts` and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `current_counts` is updated at the index corresponding to `colors[1]`, `desired_counts` meets or exceeds `current_counts`, `n` is greater than 1, and `right` is 1.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated at the index corresponding to `colors[1]`, `desired_counts` meets or exceeds `current_counts`, `n` is greater than 1, `right` is 1**
