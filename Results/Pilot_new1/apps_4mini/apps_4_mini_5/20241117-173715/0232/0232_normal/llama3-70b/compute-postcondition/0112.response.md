The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is set to True, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
