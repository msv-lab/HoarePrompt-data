The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split by spaces. The input will provide a list of integers, which will populate `counts`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unchanged, but `counts` will now hold the integers derived from the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged variables and the new `counts` variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers derived from input, and `counts` is a list of integers from input.**
