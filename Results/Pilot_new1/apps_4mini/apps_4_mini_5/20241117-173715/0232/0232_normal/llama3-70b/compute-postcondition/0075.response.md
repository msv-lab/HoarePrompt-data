The line of code `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows: `found` is set to True, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`. The state of `window_counts` is updated, but other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`found` is set to True, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, `color` is assigned from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is set to 0**
