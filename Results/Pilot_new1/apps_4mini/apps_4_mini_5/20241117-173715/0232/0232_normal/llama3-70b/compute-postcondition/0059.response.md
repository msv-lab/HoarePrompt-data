Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, ensuring that `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
