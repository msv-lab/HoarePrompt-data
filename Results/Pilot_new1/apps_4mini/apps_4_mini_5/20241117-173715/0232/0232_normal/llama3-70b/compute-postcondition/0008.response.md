The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, it would have been added with a value of 0, and after this operation, it becomes 1. If `color` was already present in `color_counts`, its value simply increases by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated count for `color`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first element of the `colors` list, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
