The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
