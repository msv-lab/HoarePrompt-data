The values of `n` and `m` are assigned from the input that is accepted as a string and split into two parts, which are then converted to integers. The initial values of `n` and `m` are not specified, but they are constrained by the conditions given (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n). The lists `colors` and `counts` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n)**
