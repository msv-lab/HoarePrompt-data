Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is False, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, and `j` is `i + 1`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, no changes are made to `window_counts`.***
