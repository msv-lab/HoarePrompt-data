The code assigns an empty dictionary to `window_counts`, which means that the previous value of `window_counts` (which was an empty dictionary) remains unchanged. The other variables `found`, `colors`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i`.

Output State: **`found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i**
