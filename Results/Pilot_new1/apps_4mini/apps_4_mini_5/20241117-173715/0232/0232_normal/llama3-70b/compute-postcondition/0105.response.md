Postcondition: ***`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating a successful match. The variable `window_counts[color]` is updated, `colors` remains a non-empty list, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing without any updates to `found`, `window_counts`, `colors`, `n`, `i`, `j`, or `color`.***
