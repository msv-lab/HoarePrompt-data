Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` at any iteration; otherwise, `found` remains False. `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` will take values from `i` to `n-1`. If `n` is equal to or less than `i`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. Additionally, if `colors` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `window_counts` will remain empty, with `found` still being False.**
