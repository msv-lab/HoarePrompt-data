Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `color` is the second element of the `colors` list. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` already exists in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
