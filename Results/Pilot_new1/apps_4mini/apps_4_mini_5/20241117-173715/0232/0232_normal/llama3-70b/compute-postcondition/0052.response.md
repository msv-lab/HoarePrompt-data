Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, indicating that all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `found` is False, the execution continues without breaking, and `window_counts` remains unchanged if the loop does not execute due to `n` being less than or equal to `i`, or it may be updated based on the colors counted from the `colors` list if `n` is greater than `i`.***
