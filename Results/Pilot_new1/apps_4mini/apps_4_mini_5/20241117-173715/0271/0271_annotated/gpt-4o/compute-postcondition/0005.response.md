To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial conditions. 

- `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9.
- `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`, which means it will yield the last digit of `n`, and it is specified to be between 6 and 9.

Now, let's break down the code snippet:

```
result = n + (10 - remainder)
```

1. `remainder` is guaranteed to be either 6, 7, 8, or 9.
2. The expression `(10 - remainder)` will yield:
   - If `remainder` is 6, then `10 - remainder` is 4.
   - If `remainder` is 7, then `10 - remainder` is 3.
   - If `remainder` is 8, then `10 - remainder` is 2.
   - If `remainder` is 9, then `10 - remainder` is 1.

3. Therefore, `result` will be calculated as:
   - If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + 4`.
   - If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + 3`.
   - If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + 2`.
   - If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + 1`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, and we denote that `result` is assigned a value based on the calculations above.

Thus, the output state will reflect the possible values of `result` based on the conditions provided.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9; `remainder` is between 6 and 9; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.**
