The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9. The previous value of `n` is not specified, but it will be replaced by the new input value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9**
