The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` calculates the next multiple of 10 that is greater than `n`. Given the conditions that `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, we can determine the output.

Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n % 10` will produce a value between 1 and 9. Given that the last digit is greater than 5, `n % 10` will yield a value between 6 and 9. Therefore, `10 - n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 4.

Thus, `n + (10 - n % 10)` will yield the next multiple of 10 after `n`.

The output state will reflect that `n` remains unchanged, and the result of the print statement is the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, `n` is greater than 5 when divided by 10, and the function prints the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`.**
