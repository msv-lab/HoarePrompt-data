The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the value of `n` will be set to the integer input provided by the user. Other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9**
