The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. The value of `n` is an input non-negative integer within the range 0 to 10^9. Therefore, `remainder` will be a value from 0 to 9, depending on the last digit of `n`. The state of `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`**
