The variable `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`, and it is stated that `remainder` is greater than 5. Given this, the possible values for `remainder` are 6, 7, 8, or 9. 

The code snippet assigns the value of `result` as `n + (10 - remainder)`. 

Calculating `result`:
- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`

Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is defined, the output state will reflect the possible values of `result` based on the various possible values of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` and greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`**
