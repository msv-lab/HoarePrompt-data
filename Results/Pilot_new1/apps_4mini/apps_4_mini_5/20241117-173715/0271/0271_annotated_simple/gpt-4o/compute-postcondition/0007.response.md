To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the given code snippet.

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9.

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(result)
```

However, the code snippet does not define or calculate `result`. It assumes that `result` has already been computed based on the initial state of `n`. Since there is no specific value given for `n`, we cannot compute the value of `result`. 

Thus, the output state will indicate that `result` is not defined due to the absence of calculations or assignments in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `result` is not defined.**
