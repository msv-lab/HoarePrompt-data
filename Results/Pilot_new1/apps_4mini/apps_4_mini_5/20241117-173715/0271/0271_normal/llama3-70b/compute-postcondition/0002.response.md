The code executes a print statement that outputs the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer within the specified range and is divisible by 10, the state of other variables remains unchanged. The output will reflect the value of `n` as it is printed. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10, and the function prints `n`.**
