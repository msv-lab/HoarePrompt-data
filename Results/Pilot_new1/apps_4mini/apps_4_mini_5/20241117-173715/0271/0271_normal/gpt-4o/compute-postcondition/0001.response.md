The value of `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer based on the input, `remainder` will hold the value of the last digit of `n`. The output state does not change the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer based on the input; `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer based on the input; `remainder` is the last digit of `n`**
