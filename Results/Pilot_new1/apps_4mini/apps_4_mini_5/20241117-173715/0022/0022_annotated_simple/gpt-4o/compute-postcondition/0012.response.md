Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop checks pairs of characters from the start and end of the string `s`, comparing `s[i]` with `s[n - 1 - i]` for `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`. If any pair of characters are not equal, the function returns False. If all pairs are equal, the loop completes without returning, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns True since a single character is trivially a palindrome.**
