According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n // 2` is at least 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

Since the loop checks characters from both ends of the string `s`, and since the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s` (as the loop continues), `is_spalindrome` remains True. The next character to be checked will be the second character from the start and the second character from the end of the string.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
