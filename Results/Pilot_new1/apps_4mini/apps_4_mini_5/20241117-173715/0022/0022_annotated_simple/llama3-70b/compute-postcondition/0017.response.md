Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if all corresponding characters from the start and end of the string `s` are equal; otherwise, `is_spalindrome` is False if any character pair is not equal. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True since a single character is always a palindrome. If `n` is at least 2, the loop executes up to `n // 2` times, checking character pairs.**
