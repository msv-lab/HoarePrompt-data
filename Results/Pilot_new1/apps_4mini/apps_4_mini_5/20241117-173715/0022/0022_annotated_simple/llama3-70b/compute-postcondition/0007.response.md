Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and we break out of the loop. If the first and last characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, and the function continues to check other characters as needed.***
