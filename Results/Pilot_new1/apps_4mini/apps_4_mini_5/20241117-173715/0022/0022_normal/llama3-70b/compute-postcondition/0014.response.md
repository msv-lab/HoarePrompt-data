The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 2, `is_palindrome` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
