Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it is False. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is at least 2, the loop executes up to `n // 2` times, checking corresponding characters from the start and end of the string. If any characters do not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop exits early. If all checks pass, `is_spalindrome` remains True.**
