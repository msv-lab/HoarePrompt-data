Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 5, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and the loop or statement is exited. If the characters are equal, `is_palindrome` remains unchanged, and the loop continues.***
