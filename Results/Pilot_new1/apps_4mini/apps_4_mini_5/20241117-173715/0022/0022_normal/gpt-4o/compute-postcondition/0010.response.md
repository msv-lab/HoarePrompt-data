Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i` of `s`, the function returns False. If the characters are equal, the function does not return any value, implying that the check for equality passes.***
