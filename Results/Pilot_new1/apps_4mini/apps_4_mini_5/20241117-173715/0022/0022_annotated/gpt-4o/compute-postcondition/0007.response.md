Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters are equal, no value is returned, indicating that the condition does not hold.***
