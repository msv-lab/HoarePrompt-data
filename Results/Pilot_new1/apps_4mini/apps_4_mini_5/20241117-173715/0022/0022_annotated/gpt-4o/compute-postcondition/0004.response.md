Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False, indicating a mismatch. If the characters are equal or if the function does not return (i.e., the else part), no specific action is taken, and the function continues beyond this point, implying that the characters at the compared indices are equal.***
