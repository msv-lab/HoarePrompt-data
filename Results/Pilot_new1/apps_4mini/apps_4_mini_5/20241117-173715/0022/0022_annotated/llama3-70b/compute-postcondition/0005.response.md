The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, which means that it is no longer considered a palindrome. The previous value of `is_spalindrome` was `True`. Other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `is_spalindrome` is False, and the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`.
