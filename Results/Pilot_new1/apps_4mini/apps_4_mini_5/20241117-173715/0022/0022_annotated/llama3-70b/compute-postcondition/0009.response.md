The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
