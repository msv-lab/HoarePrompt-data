Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if the string `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it is False. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is 2 or greater, the loop executes up to `n // 2` times, comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If any characters do not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop exits.**
