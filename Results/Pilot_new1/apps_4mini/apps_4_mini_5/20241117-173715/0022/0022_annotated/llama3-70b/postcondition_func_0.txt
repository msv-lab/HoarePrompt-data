The function accepts a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome. If the string reads the same forwards and backwards, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input string length is less than 1, as it assumes valid input, and it does not return any value but prints the result directly.
