Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers with leading zeros removed, and their lengths are equal. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. Additionally, if either `a` or `b` is empty, it is treated as '0', ensuring that the comparison remains valid and the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal throughout the execution.***
