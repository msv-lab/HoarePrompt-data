Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'. `b` is the string representation of the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed; if `b` is empty, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is less than or equal to `b`.***
