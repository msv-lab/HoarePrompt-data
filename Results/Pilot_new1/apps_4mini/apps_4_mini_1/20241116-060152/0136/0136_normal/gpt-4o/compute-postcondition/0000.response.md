The code takes input from the user, splits it into separate components, and assigns those components to the variable `data`. Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, the `input()` function will accept a string that may contain these integers. The `split()` method will separate the input string into a list based on whitespace.

The values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this line of code, but `data` will now hold the split components of the input. The exact values of `data` depend on the user input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
