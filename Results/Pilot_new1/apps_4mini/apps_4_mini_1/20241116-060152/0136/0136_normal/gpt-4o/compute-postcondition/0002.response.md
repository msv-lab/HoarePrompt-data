The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. The previous value of `data[1]` is not specified, but the operation will ensure that `b` is assigned a string that represents a non-negative integer without leading zeros. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; `b` is the string representation of the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; `b` is the string representation of the second element of `data` with leading zeros removed.**
