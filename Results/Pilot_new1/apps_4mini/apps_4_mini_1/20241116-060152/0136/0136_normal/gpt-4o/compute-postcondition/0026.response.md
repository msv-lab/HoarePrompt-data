The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to \(10^6\) digits. The function processes these input strings and returns a result based on their values. However, the specific output or behavior of the function is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, potentially handling very large numbers represented as strings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and may handle very large numbers.**
