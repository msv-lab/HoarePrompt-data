The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `data[0]` will be a string representation of a non-negative integer. The value of `b` and the contents of `data` are not affected by this operation. The leading zeros will be removed from `data[0]`, and if `data[0]` is all zeros, `a` will become an empty string. 

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the first element of `data` with leading zeros removed; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
