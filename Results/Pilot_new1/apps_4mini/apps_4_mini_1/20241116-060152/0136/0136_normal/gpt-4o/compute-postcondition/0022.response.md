Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers with leading zeros removed, where `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. Additionally, if either `a` or `b` is empty, it is treated as '0', ensuring the lengths of `a` and `b` remain equal throughout the comparison.***
