The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to 10^6 digits. The function performs an operation on these two string representations of integers and returns the result as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return the result of an operation on these integers as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and returns the result of an operation on these integers as a string.**
