The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '<'. The variables `a` and `b` are not modified by this operation, so their states remain unchanged. The output state reflects that the string '<' is printed.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, the strings `a` and `b` are not equal, and `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, and the output is '<'**
