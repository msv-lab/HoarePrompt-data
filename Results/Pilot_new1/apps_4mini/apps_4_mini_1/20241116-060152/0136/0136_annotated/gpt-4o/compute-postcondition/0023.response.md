Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros (or '0' if initially empty), and `b` is a non-empty string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros. The lengths of `a` and `b` are equal. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '<' is printed. If `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, '>' is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, '=' is printed. The `data` remains unchanged.***
