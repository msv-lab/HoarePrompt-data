Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros, and if `a` is initially empty, it is set to '0'. `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros, and `b` is not empty. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. The value of `a` is equal to `b`. The `data` remains unchanged.***
