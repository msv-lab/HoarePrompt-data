The code assigns the value of `data[1]` after stripping any leading zeros to the variable `b`. The initial state indicates that `b` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer string, but now it will be updated based on the new value derived from `data[1]`. The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros, and `data` itself remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros; `data` is unchanged.**
