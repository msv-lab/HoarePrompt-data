Postcondition: ***`a` is a string value of `data[0]` without leading zeros (or '0' if initially empty), and `b` is a string value of `data[1]` without leading zeros (or '0' if initially empty). If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, then if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. The `data` remains unchanged.***
