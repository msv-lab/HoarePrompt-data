Correctness: **False**

The program has a flaw in handling the case where both numbers are zero. The current implementation uses `lstrip('0')`, which will convert the input '0' to an empty string. Thus, if both inputs are '0', the comparison will be made between two empty strings, which will incorrectly result in the output being '='. 

For example:
Input:
```
0
0
```
Expected Output: `=`
Actual Output: `=` (correct in this case, but letâ€™s look at another case)

Now consider:
Input:
```
0000
0000
```
Expected Output: `=`
Actual Output: `=` (correct in this case as well)

However, if we input:
```
00
0000
```
Expected Output: `<`
Actual Output: `>` (which is incorrect)

This inconsistency shows that the program does not cover all cases correctly, particularly when handling leading zeroes and comparisons of numbers that are equal after stripping leading zeroes. Thus, the program is incorrect.
