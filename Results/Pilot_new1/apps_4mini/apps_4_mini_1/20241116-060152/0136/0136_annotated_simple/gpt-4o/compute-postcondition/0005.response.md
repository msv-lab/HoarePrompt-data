Postcondition: ***`a` is a string derived from the first string in `data` with leading zeros removed; if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'. `b` is the string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input. If `a` was originally empty, it becomes '0', otherwise, it retains its non-empty value.***
