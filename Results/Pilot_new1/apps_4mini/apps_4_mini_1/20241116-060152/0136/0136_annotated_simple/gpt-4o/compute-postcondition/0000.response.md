The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, assigning this list to the variable `data`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this operation. The content of `data` will depend on the user's input, which consists of non-negative integers represented as strings.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer string, `b` is a non-negative integer string, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from the input.**
