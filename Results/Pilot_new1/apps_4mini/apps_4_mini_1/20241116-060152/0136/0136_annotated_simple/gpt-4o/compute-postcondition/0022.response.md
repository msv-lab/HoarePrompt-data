Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings derived from the first two elements of `data` with leading zeros removed, and if either was originally empty, it is set to '0'. The lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, and since `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, if `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
