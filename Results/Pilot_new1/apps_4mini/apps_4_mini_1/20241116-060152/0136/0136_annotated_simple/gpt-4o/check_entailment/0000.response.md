To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic based on the problem description and the annotations provided.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program needs to read two very long integers `a` and `b`, which can have leading zeros.
2. It should compare `a` and `b` and print:
   - `<` if `a < b`
   - `>` if `a > b`
   - `=` if `a == b`
3. The input can have up to 10^6 digits.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
```

### Logical Steps:
1. **Leading Zeros Removal**: The program removes leading zeros from both `a` and `b`. If this results in an empty string (which means the original number was zero), it assigns '0' to that variable.
2. **Length Comparison**:
   - If the length of `a` is less than `b`, it prints `<`.
   - If the length of `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `>`.
3. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths are equal, it compares `a` and `b` lexicographically (as strings):
   - Prints `<` if `a < b`.
   - Prints `>` if `a > b`.
   - Prints `=` if they are equal.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where both numbers are zero (e.g., `0` and `0`).
- It also handles leading zeros correctly, ensuring that `00012345` is treated as `12345`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not check for invalid input cases (like non-numeric strings), but since the description does not specify handling invalid inputs, we will assume the input is valid as per the problem statement.
- The program relies on the input method `input()`, which is appropriate for Python 3, but the problem description suggests using `raw_input()` in Python 2. This inconsistency is not directly related to the logical correctness of the program but indicates it may not run in an environment expecting Python 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to compare two long integers, handles leading zeros, and outputs the correct symbols based on the comparisons. Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
