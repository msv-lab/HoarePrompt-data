Output State: **`a` is a string derived from the first string in `data` with leading zeros removed; if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is a string from `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and if `b` was originally empty, it is set to '0'; the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`; and the output is '<'.**
