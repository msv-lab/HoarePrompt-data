Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when both inputs are empty strings after stripping leading zeros. If both `a` and `b` are empty (which can happen if both inputs are "0" or just empty), the program will compare two empty strings, which will lead to incorrect output. Specifically, it would incorrectly output "=" since both would be empty, but according to the problem description, both should be treated as equal to "0". 

Additionally, if both inputs are "0", the program would also output "=" as expected. However, the edge case of empty strings needs to be handled explicitly to ensure correctness in all scenarios. 

For example:
- Input:
```
0
0
```
Output: `=` (correct)
- Input:
```
0
```
```
```
Output: `=` (incorrect, should not happen as per the problem description)

Thus, the program fails to account for the scenario of empty input strings after stripping leading zeros.
