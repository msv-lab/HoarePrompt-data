The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `x` and `y` that meet the specified constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters x and y, which are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
