The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The previous values of `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100000\), but they will be replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` now hold the new input values, while the constraints on their values still apply.

Output State: **`x` is a new integer, `y` is a new integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100000**
