The values of `x` and `y` are assigned new values based on the input provided, where `input().split()` accepts two integers separated by a space, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` after the execution depend on the input. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and `x`, `y` are assigned new integer values from input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and `x`, `y` are assigned new integer values from input.**
