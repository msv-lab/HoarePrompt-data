The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific output or behavior of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine the return values or conditions based on the input parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function is simply to accept the integer parameters `x` and `y` within the specified constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers satisfying the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
