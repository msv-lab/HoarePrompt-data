The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on two integers `x` and `y`, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, given the constraints on `x` and `y`, we can infer that the function likely performs some calculations or checks based on these values. 

Since the output details are not provided, we cannot specify the return values or conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function is not fully defined without additional information on its output.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the return value is not specified.**
