The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the initial state where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, the value of `abs(x - y)` will always be a positive integer since `x` is greater than `y`. The specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided, so we can only state the relationship.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(x - y)**
