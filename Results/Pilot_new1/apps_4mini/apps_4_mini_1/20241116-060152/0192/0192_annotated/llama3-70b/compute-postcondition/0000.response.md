The values of `x` and `y` are assigned from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the input values into integers. The initial conditions state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, after execution, `x` and `y` will hold the values from the input. 

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
