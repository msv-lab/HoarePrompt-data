According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is updated to the result of `a_prev % b_prev`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must still be non-zero. Since there are no specific values provided for `a_prev` and `b_prev`, I cannot determine the exact value of `b`. Therefore, I need to ensure that `b` is non-zero.

State: **`a` is updated to the previous value of `b`, `b` is updated to a non-zero value**
