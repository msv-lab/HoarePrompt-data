Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, it returns the unchanged value of `a`. The function handles both positive and negative integers, as well as zero. If both `a` and `b` are zero, the behavior is not defined, and the function will return 0. **
