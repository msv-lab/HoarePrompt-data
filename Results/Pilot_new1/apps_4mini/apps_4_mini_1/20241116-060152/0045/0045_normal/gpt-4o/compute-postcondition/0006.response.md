The code creates a list called `sequence` using a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over a range of `k`, and for each `i`, it calculates `d * (i + 1)`. The variable `d` has been previously calculated as `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`. 

The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and `d` are not changed by this operation, and `remainder` is also unaffected. The list `sequence` will contain `k` elements, where each element is the product of `d` and the index incremented by 1.

Thus, the output state will reflect the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and the newly created `sequence`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, and `sequence` is a list of k elements calculated as [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]**
