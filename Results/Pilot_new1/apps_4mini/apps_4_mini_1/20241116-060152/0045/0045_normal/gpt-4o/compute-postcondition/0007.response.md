According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is also a positive integer, we can infer that `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` will take the value of `k - 1` in the first iteration, and it will decrement until it reaches `0`. Therefore, the loop can execute if `k` is at least 1, and `i` will start at `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is calculated as n // min_sum, `remainder` is calculated as n - d * min_sum, `sequence` is a list of k elements calculated as [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)], `i` is k - 1**
