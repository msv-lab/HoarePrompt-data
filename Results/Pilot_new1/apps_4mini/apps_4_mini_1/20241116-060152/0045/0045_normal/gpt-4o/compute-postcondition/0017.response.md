The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `sequence[i]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged with `i` being -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged with `i` being -1.**
