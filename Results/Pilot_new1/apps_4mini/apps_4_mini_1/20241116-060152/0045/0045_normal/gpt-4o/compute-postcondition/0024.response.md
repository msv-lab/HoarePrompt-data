Output State: **`sequence` is a list of `k` elements where the last elements are incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `remainder` is decreased by the number of times the loop executed, and if `remainder` is initially 0, the loop does not execute and `sequence` remains unchanged. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute and `sequence` remains an empty list.**
