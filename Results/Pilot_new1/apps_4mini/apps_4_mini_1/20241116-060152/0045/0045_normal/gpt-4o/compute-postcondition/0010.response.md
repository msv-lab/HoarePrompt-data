Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the sequence can be perfectly divided without any leftover. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues without breaking, implying that there is a remainder that needs to be addressed in subsequent iterations.***
