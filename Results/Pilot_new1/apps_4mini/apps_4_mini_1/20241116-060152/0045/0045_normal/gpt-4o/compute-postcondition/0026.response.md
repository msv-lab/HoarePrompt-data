The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with constraints such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case 1, if the value of `min_sum`, calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. 

In Case 2, if the condition in Case 1 is not met, the function returns a list called 'sequence', which may either remain unchanged or have its last elements incremented based on the number of times a loop executed, influenced by the initial values of 'remainder' and 'k'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return -1 if the minimum sum of the first `k` integers exceeds `n`. If this condition is not met, it returns a modified or unmodified list called 'sequence'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns -1 if the minimum sum of the first `k` integers exceeds `n`. If this condition is not met, it returns a list 'sequence' that may be modified based on certain conditions.**
