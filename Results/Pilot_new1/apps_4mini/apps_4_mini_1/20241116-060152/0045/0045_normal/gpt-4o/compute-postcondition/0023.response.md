According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0` because the loop has been decrementing `i` in each iteration until it reaches `-1`, at which point the loop stops executing.

In order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `1` (the value it would have before the last iteration), and `k` must be at least `2` to ensure that `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `0`. The other states do not need to be adjusted since they are not directly affected by the loop control variable `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is unchanged with `i` being 1, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
