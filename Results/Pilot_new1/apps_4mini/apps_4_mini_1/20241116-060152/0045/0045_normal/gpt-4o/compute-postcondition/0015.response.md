Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged with `i` being -1. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the process has completed successfully. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues execution without breaking.***
