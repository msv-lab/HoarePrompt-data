To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic in the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have the maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD).
2. If it is not possible to create such a sequence, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers. This is a necessary condition because the smallest strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers is simply `1, 2, ..., k`.
   - If `min_sum > n`, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Finding the Sequence**:
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which determines how many times we can scale the minimum sequence.
   - The `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, which is the leftover amount after scaling the minimum sequence.

3. **Building the Sequence**:
   - The sequence is initialized as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which gives `[d, 2d, ..., kd]`.
   - The program then attempts to distribute the `remainder` across the sequence to ensure the numbers remain strictly increasing.
   - It iterates backward through the sequence, incrementing elements until the `remainder` is exhausted.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Strictly Increasing Condition**:
   - When distributing the `remainder`, if `d` is `0`, the sequence will contain zeros, which violates the condition of being positive integers.
   - If `d > 0`, the sequence will start from `d`, but if `remainder` is not handled correctly, it may lead to duplicates or non-increasing sequences.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider `n = 1` and `k = 1`. The expected output should be `1`, and in this case, the program would work correctly.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the output is `1 2 3`, which is expected.
   - However, for `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the logic correctly for the cases analyzed. However, let's consider an edge case:

- **Edge Case**: If `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the minimum sum is `10` (1 + 2 + 3 + 4). The program would compute `d = 10 // 10 = 1`, and the sequence would start as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The `remainder` would be `0`, and the output would be `1 2 3 4`, which is correct.

After evaluating various scenarios and edge cases, the program does appear to function correctly for all given constraints and produces valid outputs. 

Thus, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
