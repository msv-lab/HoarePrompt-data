To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

The problem requires us to generate a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers such that their sum equals n and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized. If it's impossible to create such a sequence, we should return -1.

Let's break down the code:

1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1`, which is correct because we cannot have a strictly increasing sequence of k positive integers if the sum is less than k.

2. It then initializes an empty list `seq` and enters a loop to fill it with integers from 1 to k. It subtracts each integer from `n` until `n` is no longer sufficient to add the next integer. 

3. After the loop, it checks if the length of `seq` is equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`. If it is, it prints the sequence.

### Issues with the Code:

The logic of the program does not guarantee the maximum GCD for the resulting sequence. For example, consider the case:

- **Input:** `n = 12`, `k = 3`
- **Expected Output:** A sequence like `2, 4, 6` which has a GCD of 2 and sums to 12.
- **Actual Output from the Code:** `1, 2, 3` which has a GCD of 1 and sums to 6, failing to utilize the maximum GCD.

The program also does not handle the case where a sequence can be formed that maximizes the GCD. 

### Conclusion:

Since the program does not ensure that the GCD of the sequence is maximized and can produce incorrect results for valid inputs, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

An example where the program fails is the input `12 3`, where the expected output should maximize the GCD, but the program outputs `1 2 3` instead.
