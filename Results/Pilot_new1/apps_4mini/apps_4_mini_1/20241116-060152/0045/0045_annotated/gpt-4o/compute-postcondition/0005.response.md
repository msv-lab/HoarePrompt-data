The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The value of `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, which means `d` is the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. Therefore, `d * min_sum` is the largest multiple of `min_sum` that is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `remainder` represents the leftover amount after subtracting this multiple from `n`.

Since `n` is a positive integer and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` will also be a non-negative integer. The calculation of `remainder` will yield a non-negative integer as well, since it represents what is left after taking out the largest multiple of `min_sum`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`**.
