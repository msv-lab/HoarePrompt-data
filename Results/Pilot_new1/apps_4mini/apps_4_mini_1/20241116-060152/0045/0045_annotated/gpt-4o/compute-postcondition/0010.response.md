Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the sequence can be formed without any leftover value. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues executing without breaking. The `sequence` remains a list of `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is `k - 1`.***
