Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is greater than 0, the program continues executing beyond this if statement. The `sequence` is updated to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in the range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `k - 2.`***
