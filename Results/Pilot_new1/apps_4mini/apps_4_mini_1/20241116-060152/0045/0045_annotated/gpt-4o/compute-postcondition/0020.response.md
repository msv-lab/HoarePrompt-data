Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1 while `sequence[i]` is increased by 1 for `i` in the range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 3. If `remainder` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that no further iterations can occur.***
