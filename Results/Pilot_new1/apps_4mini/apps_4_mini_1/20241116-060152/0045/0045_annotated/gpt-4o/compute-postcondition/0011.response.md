Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`, and the program continues executing without breaking; `sequence` is updated to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is `k - 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
