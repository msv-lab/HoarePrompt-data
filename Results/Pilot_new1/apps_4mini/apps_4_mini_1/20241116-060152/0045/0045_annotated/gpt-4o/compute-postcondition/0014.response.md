The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` is updated to `d * (i + 1)` for `i` in range `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `k - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
