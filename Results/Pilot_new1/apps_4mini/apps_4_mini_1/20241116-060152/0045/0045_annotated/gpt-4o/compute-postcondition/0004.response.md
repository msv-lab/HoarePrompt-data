The value of `d` is assigned the result of the integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. The previous values of `n` and `min_sum` are positive integers, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the integer division will yield a non-negative integer for `d`. The output state reflects the values of `n`, `min_sum`, and the newly calculated value of `d`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `d` is `n // min_sum`**
