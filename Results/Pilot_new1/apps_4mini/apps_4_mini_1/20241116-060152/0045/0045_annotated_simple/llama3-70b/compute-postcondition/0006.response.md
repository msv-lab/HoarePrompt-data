Output State: **If `b` is greater than 0, the loop will execute until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` will hold the last non-zero value of `b`, which is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `n` and `k`. If `b` is initially 0, the loop will not execute, and the value of `a` will remain unchanged.**
