The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, the function will return `a` as the GCD immediately, without entering the loop. The function correctly computes the GCD for any pair of integers, including cases where one or both integers are zero.
