According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from `k - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`. Additionally, since `i` is being decremented in the loop, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `2`, so that `k - 1` is a valid index.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` must be at least `2` to ensure `i` can be `k - 1`.
- `i` needs to be set to `k - 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is unchanged.**
