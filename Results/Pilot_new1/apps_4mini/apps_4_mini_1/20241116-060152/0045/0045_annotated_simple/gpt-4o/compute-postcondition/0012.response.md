The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is not specified, but it is known to be a non-negative integer since it is calculated as `n` minus `d * min_sum`. This operation affects only the `remainder` variable, and no other variables are changed. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
