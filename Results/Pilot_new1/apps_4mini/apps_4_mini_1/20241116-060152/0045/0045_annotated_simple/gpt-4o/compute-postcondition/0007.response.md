According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `k - 1` down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`, since the range function needs to have at least one element to iterate over. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive integer, we can deduce that `k` must be greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to execute. The variable `i` will start at `k - 1` and decrement down to `0`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state before the loop starts are:
- `k` must be at least `1` (which is already given as a positive integer).
- `i` should be initialized to `k - 1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements: `[d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k]`, `i` is `k - 1`**
