According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be decremented by 1. Currently, `i` is `k - 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` should be `k - 2`. 

Additionally, since `i` is used to index the `sequence`, `sequence[i]` should reflect the value at `sequence[k - 2]` for the next iteration. However, since the loop body is omitted, we don't know if any other states need to be adjusted.

So, to summarize, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be `k - 2`.

Since `k` is at least 2, this means `i` will be at least `0`, which is valid for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 2, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
