The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum` are known from the initial state. Specifically, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `min_sum` is determined as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. The calculation for `remainder` uses these values. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.**
