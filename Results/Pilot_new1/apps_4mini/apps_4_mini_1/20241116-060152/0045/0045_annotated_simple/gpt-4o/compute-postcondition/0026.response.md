The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

In Case 1, the function calculates `min_sum` as \(k * (k + 1) // 2\). If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function does not return any value, indicating that the condition is satisfied.

In Case 2, the function returns the final state of a sequence, which is either modified based on the loop execution or remains as \([d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k]\) if the remainder is 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the sum of the first `k` integers is greater than `n`, and return -1 if so; otherwise, it proceeds to return a sequence based on further calculations or remains unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns -1 if the sum of the first `k` integers exceeds `n`; otherwise, it returns a sequence based on further calculations or remains as [d * 1, d * 2, ..., d * k].**
