To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday among `k` people in a year with `2^n` days.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Input Constraints**: The function must handle very large values for `n` and `k` (up to \(10^{18}\)).
2. **Output Requirements**: The output must be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) and both \( A \) and \( B \) must be taken modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).
3. **Probability Calculation**: The program should correctly compute the probability that at least two people share a birthday.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Calculation of Total Days**: The program correctly computes the total number of days as \( 2^n \).

2. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**:
   - The numerator is computed as the product of \( total\_days - i \) for each person \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \). This represents the number of ways to assign different birthdays to each of the \( k \) people.
   - The denominator is simply \( total\_days^k \), which is the total number of ways to assign birthdays to \( k \) people.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program calculates the GCD of the numerator and denominator to reduce the fraction. However, it uses `math.gcd(numerator, denominator)` which is incorrect because it should be using the `gcd` function to reduce the fraction before taking modulo.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( k > total\_days \) correctly. If \( k \) is greater than \( 2^n \), it should immediately return \( 1, 1 \) since it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday.
   - The program may run into performance issues with large values of \( n \) and \( k \) due to the potential overflow of the numerator and denominator.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the case where \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \):
- The total number of days is \( 2^1 = 2 \).
- Since \( k > total\_days \), the output should be \( 1, 1 \).
- However, the program will attempt to calculate the numerator and denominator, which will not correctly reflect the guaranteed overlap in birthdays.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not correctly handle the case where \( k > total\_days \) and may produce incorrect results for such inputs, we can conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**.
