Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the program outputs (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, no action is taken and the program continues executing.***
