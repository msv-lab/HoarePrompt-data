According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than `i_last + 1`, which implies that `k` is at least `i_last + 2`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to `i_last + 1` for the loop to execute one more time. Since `k` is greater than `i_last + 1`, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- Set `i` to `i_last + 1`.

The other states (`denominator`, `total_days`, `MOD`, and `numerator`) remain unchanged.

State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `total_days` is unchanged, `MOD` is unchanged, `k` is greater than `i_last + 1`, `numerator` is unchanged, `i` is `i_last + 1`**
