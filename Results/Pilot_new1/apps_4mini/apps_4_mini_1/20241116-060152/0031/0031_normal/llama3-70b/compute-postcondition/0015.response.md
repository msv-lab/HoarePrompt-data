To analyze the impact of the code snippet `numerator //= gcd`, we need to consider both scenarios based on the value of `k`.

1. **If k is at least 1**:
   - Initial State: `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is \(2^k\), and `gcd` is \(2^k\).
   - The operation `numerator //= gcd` means `numerator` will be updated to `numerator // gcd`. Since `numerator` is 0, the result of `0 // (2^k)` is still 0.
   - Therefore, after the execution, `numerator` remains 0, and the other variables are unchanged.

2. **If k is 0 or negative**:
   - Initial State: `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, and `gcd` is 1.
   - The operation `numerator //= gcd` means `numerator` will be updated to `numerator // gcd`. Since `numerator` is 1, the result of `1 // 1` is still 1.
   - Therefore, after the execution, `numerator` remains 1, and the other variables are unchanged.

In both cases, the values of the other variables (`denominator` and `gcd`) remain unchanged, and the output state will reflect the final values of `numerator` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **If k is at least 1: `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is \(2^k\), `gcd` is \(2^k\); If k is 0 or negative: `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 1.**
