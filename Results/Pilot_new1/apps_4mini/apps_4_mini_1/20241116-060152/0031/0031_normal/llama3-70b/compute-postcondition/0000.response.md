The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`. The value of `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, so `total_days` will be a power of 2 based on the value of `n`. The other variable `k` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `total_days` calculated as `2 ** n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 ** n**
