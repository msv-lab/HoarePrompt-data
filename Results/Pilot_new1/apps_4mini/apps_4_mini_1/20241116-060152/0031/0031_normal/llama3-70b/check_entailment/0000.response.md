To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to calculate the probability that at least two people out of `k` interviewed have the same birthday among `2^n` possible days. The result should be given as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where `A` and `B` are coprime, and the output must be given modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Code Analysis:
The code defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that:
1. Calculates the total number of days as `2^n`.
2. Initializes `numerator` and `denominator` to 1.
3. Computes the numerator as the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`.
4. Computes the denominator as `(2^n)^k`.
5. Reduces the fraction by dividing both `numerator` and `denominator` by their GCD.
6. Returns both values modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `k > 2^n`**: If there are more people than days, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. The program should output `1 1` in this case, but the current logic does not check for this condition.
2. **When `k = 1`**: The probability of at least two people sharing a birthday should be `0`, but the function does not handle this case correctly since it calculates a numerator based on the loop.
3. **Large values of `n` and `k`**: Given the constraints (up to `10^18`), the calculations of `2^n` and the products can lead to overflow issues. Python can handle large integers, but the logic might not be efficient enough for very large values.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints suggest that the function calculates the numerator and denominator correctly but does not mention the special cases where `k` is greater than `2^n` or when `k` is `1`. This omission suggests that the output hints do not fully agree with the code's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle all edge cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenarios where `k` exceeds `2^n` or when `k` is `1`. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
