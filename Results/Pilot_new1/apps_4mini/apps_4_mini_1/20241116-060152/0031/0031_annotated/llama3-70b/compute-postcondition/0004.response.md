The `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days - i`. The value of `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `i` is 0. Therefore, the calculation becomes:

\[
\numerator = \numerator \times (total\_days - i) = 1 \times (2^n - 0) = 2^n
\]

The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that k ≥ 2, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
