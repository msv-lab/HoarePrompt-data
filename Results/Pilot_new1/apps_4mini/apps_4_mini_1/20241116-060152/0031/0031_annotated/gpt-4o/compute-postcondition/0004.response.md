Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the program prints (1, 1) and returns None. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, the behavior of the program is not specified within this fragment.***
