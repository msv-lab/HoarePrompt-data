The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns None. If `k` is less than or equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, it calculates the probability of selecting `k` items from a total of 2^n items without shared elements, computes the corresponding shared probability, and outputs the reduced fraction of shared to total probabilities modulo (10^6 + 3). The behavior of the function is defined only for the case when `k` is less than or equal to 2^n, as it relies on the results from another function `func_1` for further calculations.
