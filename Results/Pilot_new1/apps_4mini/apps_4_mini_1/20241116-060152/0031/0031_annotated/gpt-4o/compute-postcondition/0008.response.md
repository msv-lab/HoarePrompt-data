According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
