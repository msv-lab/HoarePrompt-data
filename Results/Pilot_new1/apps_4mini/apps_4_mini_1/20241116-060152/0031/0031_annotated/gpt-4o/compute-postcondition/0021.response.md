To determine the output state, we need to analyze the code snippet provided in the context of the initial state.

1. The initial state indicates that `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator` if `k` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is assigned the value 1. We do not have the specific values of `numerator`, `k`, or `denominator`, but we know that `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.

2. The code snippet calculates `p_shared` using the formula:
   ```
   p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
   ```
   - `p_total` is equal to `denominator`.
   - `p_no_shared` is either `numerator` (if `k > 0`) or `1` (if `k <= 0`).
   - `MOD` is a constant that is not specified but is assumed to be a positive integer.

3. The resulting value of `p_shared` will depend on the values of `p_total` (which is `denominator`), `p_no_shared`, and `MOD`.

Since we do not have specific values for `numerator`, `denominator`, `k`, or `MOD`, we cannot calculate the exact numeric value of `p_shared`. However, we can state that `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationships and assignments of the variables involved. 

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator` if `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `p_no_shared` is assigned the value 1; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD**
