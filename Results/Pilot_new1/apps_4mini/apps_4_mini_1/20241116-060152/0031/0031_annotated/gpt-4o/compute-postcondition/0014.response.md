According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \((2^n \mod MOD) * (2^n) \mod MOD\), `i` is 2, `numerator` is \(2 * (2^n - 1) \mod MOD\)**
