The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates a `numerator` and a `denominator` based on the total number of days (which is \(2^n\)), and returns a tuple containing the values of `numerator` and `denominator`, both reduced modulo \(10^6 + 3\). However, the actual implementation results in the numerator being 0 and the denominator being 1, leading to the function consistently returning the tuple (0, 1) regardless of the input values of `n` and `k`.
