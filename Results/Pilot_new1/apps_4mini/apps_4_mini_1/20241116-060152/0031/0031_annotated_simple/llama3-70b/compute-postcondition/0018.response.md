The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, it returns the tuple (0, 1). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` and return the tuple (0, 1). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, both integers, and returns the tuple (0, 1).**
