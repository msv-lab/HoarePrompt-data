The `gcd` variable is assigned the value of `math.gcd(numerator, denominator)`. Given that `numerator` is 0 and `denominator` is \(2^k\), the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 0 and any positive integer is the positive integer itself. Therefore, `gcd` will be equal to \(2^k\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is \(2^k\), and `gcd` is \(2^k\)**
