Output State: **`A` is updated to `A // g`, `B` is updated to `B // g`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is (2^n)^k % MOD, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, and the function `func_1(A, B)` returns a value which is assigned to `g`. The output of the print statement is `(A % MOD, B % MOD)`**
