The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than `2` raised to the power of `n`, the function prints the tuple (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to `2` raised to the power of `n`, there are no further actions taken in this block. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` and print (1, 1) if `k` exceeds `2` raised to the power of `n`, while taking no action if `k` is within the limit. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than `2` raised to the power of `n`; otherwise, it takes no action.**
