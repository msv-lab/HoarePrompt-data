The code assigns `total_days` the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to `2` raised to the power of `n`. The initial state mentions that `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, there are no further actions taken in this block. 

Since `k` is not greater than `2^n`, we proceed to calculate `total_days`. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2^n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2^n`**
