Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as `s[0]`, and `shares` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop is exited (break statement is executed), and `i` is incremented by 1, maintaining the conditions of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `shares`.***
