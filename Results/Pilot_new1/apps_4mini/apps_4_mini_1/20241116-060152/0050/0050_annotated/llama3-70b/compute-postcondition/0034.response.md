The value of `shares` is assigned 0. The previous value of `shares` was also 0, so there is no change in its value. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as `s[0]`, `shares` is 0, `i` is less than `m`, and `r` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is at least as large as `s[0]`, `shares` is 0, `i` is less than `m`, and `r` remains unchanged**
