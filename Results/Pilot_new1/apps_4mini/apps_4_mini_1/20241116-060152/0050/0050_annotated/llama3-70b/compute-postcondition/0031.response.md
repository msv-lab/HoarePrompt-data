Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to at least `s[0] + shares * b[0]` if `shares` is greater than 0, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, then `r` remains at least as large as `s[0]`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
