The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`, which takes an input string of space-separated values and converts each of those values to an integer. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `b` containing the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers based on the input, and `b` is a list of integers from the input.**
