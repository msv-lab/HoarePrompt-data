The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in place in descending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the sorted state of the list `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order**.
