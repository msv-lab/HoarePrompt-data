According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and since `m` is greater than 1, it is necessary for `m` to remain greater than 1. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `shares` is 0, which means `r` remains unchanged and does not impact the loop's ability to execute again.

State: **`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
