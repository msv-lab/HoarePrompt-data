Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`, and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` when divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks, leaving `shares` unchanged and retaining its initial value of 0. Additionally, the value of `i` remains 0 throughout the execution of this block.***
