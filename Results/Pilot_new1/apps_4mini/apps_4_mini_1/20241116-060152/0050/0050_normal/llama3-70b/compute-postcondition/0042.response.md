According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `m` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `m` must be at least 4 (since `m` must be greater than `i` for the loop to continue). 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be 3.
- `m` should be greater than 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
