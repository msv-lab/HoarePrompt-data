Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2. If `shares` were greater than 0, `r` would have been updated by adding `shares * b[i]` and then `shares` would be set to 0. Since `shares` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `r`.***
