The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 30\); `r`, which is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq r \leq 1000\); `s`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(s[i]\) is constrained such that \(1 \leq s[i] \leq 1000\); and `b`, which is a list of `m` integers where each integer \(b[i]\) is constrained such that \(1 \leq b[i] \leq 1000\).

The function's output is not specified in the given information, so we cannot detail the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the specified parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b`, but the return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, s, and b with specified constraints but does not specify a return value.**
