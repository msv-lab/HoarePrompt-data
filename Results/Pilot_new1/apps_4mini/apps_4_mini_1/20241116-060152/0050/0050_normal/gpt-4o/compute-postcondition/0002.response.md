The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input, which consists of integers separated by spaces. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Since `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` will be a new list of integers derived from the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new list `b` created from the input while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input.**
