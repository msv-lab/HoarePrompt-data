The variable `b` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take a space-separated input of integers, convert them to integers using `int`, and then store them in a list. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and indicates that `b` has been assigned a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input, `b` is a list of integers from input**
