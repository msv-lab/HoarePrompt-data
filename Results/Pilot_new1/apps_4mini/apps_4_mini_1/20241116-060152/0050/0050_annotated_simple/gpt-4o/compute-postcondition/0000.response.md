The variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input, which is split into three parts and converted into integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown as they are being set by the input. The lists `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `r` are now input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of n integers, `b` is a list of m integers**
