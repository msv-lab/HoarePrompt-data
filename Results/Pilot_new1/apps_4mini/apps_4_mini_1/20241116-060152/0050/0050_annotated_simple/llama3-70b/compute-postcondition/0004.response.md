The code `b.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `b` in place in descending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `b` is modified to be sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
