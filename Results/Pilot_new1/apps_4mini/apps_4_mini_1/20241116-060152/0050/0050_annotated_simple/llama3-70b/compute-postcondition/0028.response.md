The value of `shares` is assigned to 0, which contradicts the initial state where `shares` is greater than 0. Since the initial state is invalidated by this assignment, we cannot determine any further impact on the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects this inconsistency.

Output State: **`shares` is 0, invalidating the initial state where `shares` is greater than 0**
