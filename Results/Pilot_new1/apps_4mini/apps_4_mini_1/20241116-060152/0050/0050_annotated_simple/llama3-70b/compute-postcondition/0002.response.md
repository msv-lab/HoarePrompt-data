The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input from `input().split()`. The input will provide a series of integers separated by spaces, which will be converted to integers and stored in the list `b`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`, and `s`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the input integers as part of the list `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers from input.**
