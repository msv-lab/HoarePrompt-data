Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]. If `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is equal to 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is greater than 0, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the output is also '?', while maintaining the conditions that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x â‰¤ y + z`).***
