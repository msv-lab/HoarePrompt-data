The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?` to the console. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100], with `x` greater than `y`, and `x` less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100], with `x` greater than `y`, and `x` less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '?'**
