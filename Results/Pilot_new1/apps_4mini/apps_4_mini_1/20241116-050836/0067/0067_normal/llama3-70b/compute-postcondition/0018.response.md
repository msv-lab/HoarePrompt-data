The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the provided constraints, it is implied that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers in the range [0, 100], but since they are not passed as parameters, their values must be set or defined within the function itself. The output behavior of the function is not specified. Therefore, without additional information about what the function does with `x`, `y`, and `z`, it is not possible to describe the return values or the functionality accurately.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output behavior is not defined.**
