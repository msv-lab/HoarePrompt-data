Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The value of `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes` (i.e., `y + z < x`). The value of `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`).***
