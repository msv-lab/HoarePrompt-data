The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates on three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` that are constrained to the range 0 to 100 (inclusive). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function is unclear without additional output information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but operates on three integers x, y, and z constrained to the range 0 to 100. The output behavior is not specified.**
