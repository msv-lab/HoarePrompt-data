To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program logic against the possible scenarios.

The program takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively. The program then evaluates the following conditions:

1. If `x > y + z`: This means that even if all unknown voters downvote (`z` votes), the upvotes will still outnumber the downvotes. The program correctly returns '+' in this case.

2. If `x < y`: This means that the downvotes outnumber the upvotes, and the program correctly returns '-' in this case.

3. If `x == y`: 
   - If `z == 0`: There are no unknown votes, and the upvotes equal the downvotes, so the program correctly returns '0'.
   - If `z > 0`: There are unknown votes, meaning the outcome could swing either way depending on how the unknowns vote. The program correctly returns '?' for this uncertain situation.

4. If none of the above conditions are met, the program defaults to returning '?'. However, this condition is logically unreachable because all cases are already covered.

Now, let's analyze edge cases:

- For input `(0, 0, 1)`: 
  - The program will check if `0 > 0 + 1` (false), then `0 < 0` (false), then `0 == 0` (true), and since `z` is 1, it will return '?', which is correct as there is uncertainty.

- For input `(3, 7, 0)`:
  - The program will return '-' since `3 < 7`, which is correct.

- For input `(2, 0, 1)`:
  - The program will return '+' since `2 > 0 + 1` (2 > 1), which is correct.

- For input `(1, 1, 0)`:
  - The program will return '0' since `1 == 1` and `z == 0`, which is correct.

After evaluating all potential cases and edge cases, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
