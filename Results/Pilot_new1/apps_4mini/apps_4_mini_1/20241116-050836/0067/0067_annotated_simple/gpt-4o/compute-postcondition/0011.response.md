The code executes a print statement that outputs a question mark. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the integer values of the variables.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100, and a question mark is printed.**
