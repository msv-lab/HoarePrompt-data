The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, representing minimum upvotes, minimum downvotes, and a range for both upvotes and downvotes respectively. It calculates the maximum possible upvotes as `x + z` and maximum possible downvotes as `y + z`. The function prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met, indicating the relationships between upvotes and downvotes. The function does not return any values.
