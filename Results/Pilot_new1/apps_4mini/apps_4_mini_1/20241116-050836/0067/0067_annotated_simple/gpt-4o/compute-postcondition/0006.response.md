The code executes a print statement that outputs a hyphen ('-'). This does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` as previously defined.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z < y`), and a hyphen '-' is printed.**
