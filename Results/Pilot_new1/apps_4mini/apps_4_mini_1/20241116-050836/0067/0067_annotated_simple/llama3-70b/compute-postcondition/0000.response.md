The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, but they are integers within the range of 0 to 100. After executing the code, `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values from the input, which could also be integers within the same range.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values from input, where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
