The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the assumption that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers constrained by the condition that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since the function does not take these values as arguments, the specific output based on these parameters is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on how `x`, `y`, and `z` are utilized within the function, we cannot determine the return value or the specific functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not defined based on the provided constraints.**
