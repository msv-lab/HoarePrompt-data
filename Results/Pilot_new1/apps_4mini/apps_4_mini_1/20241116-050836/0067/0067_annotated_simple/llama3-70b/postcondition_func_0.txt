The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input and prints a character based on their values: it prints '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, and '?' if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but not greater than `y + z`. The function does not return any values.
