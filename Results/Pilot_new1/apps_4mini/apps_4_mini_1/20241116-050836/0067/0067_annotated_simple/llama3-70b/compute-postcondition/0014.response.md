The code executes a print statement that outputs the string `'?'`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print function does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is greater than `y`, and the output is '?'**
