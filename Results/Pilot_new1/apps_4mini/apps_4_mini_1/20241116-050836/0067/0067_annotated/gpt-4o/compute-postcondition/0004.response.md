The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of the affected variables are: `y` is a new input integer and `z` is a new input integer. Therefore, `max_downvotes` is calculated as the sum of `y` and `z`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a new input integer, `y` is a new input integer, `z` is a new input integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`, and `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`.**
