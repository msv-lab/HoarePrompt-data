The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x` (a new input integer), `y` (a new input integer), and `z` (a new input integer). The other variables `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is a new input integer, `y` is a new input integer, `z` is a new input integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`.

Output State: **`x` is a new input integer, `y` is a new input integer, `z` is a new input integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`**
