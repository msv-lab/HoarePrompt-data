The code `print('-')` outputs a string `'-'` to the console. It does not alter the values of any of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of variable values. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`; and the output is '-'**
