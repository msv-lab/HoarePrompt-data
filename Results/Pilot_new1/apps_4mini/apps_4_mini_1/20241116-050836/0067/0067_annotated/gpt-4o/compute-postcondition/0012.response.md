Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'; otherwise, the output is '?'. The conditions ensure that `max_upvotes` is always greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, and thus the relationship between upvotes and downvotes is maintained.***
