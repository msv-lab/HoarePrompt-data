The code executes a print statement that outputs a question mark (`?`). The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged as the print function does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the function prints '?'**
