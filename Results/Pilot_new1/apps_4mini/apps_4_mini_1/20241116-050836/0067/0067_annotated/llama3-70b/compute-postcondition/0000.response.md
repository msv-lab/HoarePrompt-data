The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned from the input values after being converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after execution. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values provided**
