Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, the output is '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is positive, the output is '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the output is also '?', given that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, ensuring that all conditions are satisfied.***
