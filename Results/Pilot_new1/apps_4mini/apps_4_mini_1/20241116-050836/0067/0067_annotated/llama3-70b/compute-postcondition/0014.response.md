The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `'?'` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables, and the initial conditions remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; the value of `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.
