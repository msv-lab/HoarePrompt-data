The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, it operates with three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are defined such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since the function signature does not include these parameters, we cannot specify how they impact the output. Without additional information on the output, we cannot determine what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` remains unclear given the absence of input parameters and output details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is unspecified.**
