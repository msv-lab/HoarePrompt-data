Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`, rounding down if the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is 5 or less, and rounding up if the remainder is greater than 5. The function then prints this nearest multiple of 10. It does not return any value. **
