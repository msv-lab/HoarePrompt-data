The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `remainder` is the result of `n % 10` and is less than or equal to 5, we can deduce that `result` will be `n` minus a value between 0 and 5. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `result` while keeping the states of `n` and `remainder` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is the result of `n % 10` (less than or equal to 5), and `result` is `n - remainder`.**
