The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). However, since there are no input parameters specified in the function definition, the functionality of the function cannot be determined based on the provided information. Therefore, it is unclear what the function returns or how it processes the value of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
