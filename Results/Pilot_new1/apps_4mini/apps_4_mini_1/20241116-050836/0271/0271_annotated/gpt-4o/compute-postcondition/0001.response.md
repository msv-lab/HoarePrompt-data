The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer within the specified range, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9, inclusive. The state of the variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is `n % 10**
