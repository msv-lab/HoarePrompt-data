The function prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9) and processes it to print either `n` if it is divisible by 10, the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n` if the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, or the next multiple of 10 after `n` if the remainder is greater than 5. The function does not return any value.
