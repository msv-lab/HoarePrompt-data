The code prints the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and is divisible by 10, the output state reflects that `n` is printed but remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n` is divisible by 10**
