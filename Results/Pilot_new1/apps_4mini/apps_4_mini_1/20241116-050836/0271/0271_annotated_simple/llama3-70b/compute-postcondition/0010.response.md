The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a non-negative integer `n` that is constrained to the range 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since there are no parameters passed into the function, we cannot determine the output based on any input values. As a result, the functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of input parameters or return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.**
