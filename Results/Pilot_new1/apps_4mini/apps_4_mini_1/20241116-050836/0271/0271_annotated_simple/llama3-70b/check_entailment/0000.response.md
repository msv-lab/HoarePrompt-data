To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it is considered rounded. If not, the program should round `n` either down to the nearest lower multiple of 10 or up to the nearest higher multiple of 10, depending on the remainder when `n` is divided by 10.

### Annotated Program Explanation:
1. The program reads an integer `n`.
2. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 10:
   - If true, it prints `n`.
3. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it checks the remainder when `n` is divided by 10:
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10.
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10.

### Code Review:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    if (n % 10 == 0) :
        print(n)
    else :
        if (n % 10 <= 5) :
            print(n - n % 10)
        else :
            print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
1. **Case when n = 0**: 
   - Expected output: 0 (since it's already rounded).
   - The program correctly outputs 0.

2. **Case when n = 5**: 
   - Expected output: 0 or 10 (both are valid).
   - The program correctly can output either 0 (rounding down) or 10 (rounding up).

3. **Case when n = 10**: 
   - Expected output: 10 (already rounded).
   - The program correctly outputs 10.

4. **Case when n = 13**: 
   - Expected output: 10 (rounding down).
   - The program correctly outputs 10.

5. **Case when n = 15**: 
   - Expected output: 10 or 20 (both are valid).
   - The program correctly outputs 20 (rounding up).

6. **Case when n = 19**: 
   - Expected output: 20 (rounding up).
   - The program correctly outputs 20.

7. **Case when n = 1000000000**: 
   - Expected output: 1000000000 (already rounded).
   - The program correctly outputs 1000000000.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases as outlined in the problem description. It appropriately rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
