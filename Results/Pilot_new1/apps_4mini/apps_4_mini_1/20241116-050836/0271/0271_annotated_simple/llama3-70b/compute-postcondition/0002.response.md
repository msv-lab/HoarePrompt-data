The code prints the value of `n`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and is divisible by 10, the output will simply be the current value of `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the existing value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and `n` is divisible by 10, and the function prints `n`.**
