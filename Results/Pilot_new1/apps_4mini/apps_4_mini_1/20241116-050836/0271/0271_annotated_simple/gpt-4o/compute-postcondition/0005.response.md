The value of `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. Given that `remainder` is the last digit of `n` and is greater than 5, we can conclude that `10 - remainder` will yield a positive value less than 5. Thus, `result` will be greater than `n` but less than `n + 5`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
