To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The program reads a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the nearest integer that ends with 0. The logic used in the program is as follows:

1. It calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 (`remainder = n % 10`).
2. If the `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the `remainder` from `n`.
3. If the `remainder` is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding `(10 - remainder)` to `n`.

### Evaluation of the Code Against the Problem Description

The problem states that:
- If `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded.
- If `n` ends with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it should round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- If `n` ends with 6, 7, 8, or 9, it should round up to the nearest multiple of 10.

### Test Cases
Let's verify the program with a few test cases:

1. **Input:** `5`
   - Remainder: `5`
   - Result: `5 - 5 = 0` (Correct)
   
2. **Input:** `113`
   - Remainder: `3`
   - Result: `113 - 3 = 110` (Correct)
   
3. **Input:** `1000000000`
   - Remainder: `0`
   - Result: `1000000000 - 0 = 1000000000` (Correct)
   
4. **Input:** `5432359`
   - Remainder: `9`
   - Result: `5432359 + (10 - 9) = 5432360` (Correct)

### Edge Cases
Let's consider edge cases:
- **Input:** `0`
   - Remainder: `0`
   - Result: `0` (Correct)
   
- **Input:** `10`
   - Remainder: `0`
   - Result: `10` (Correct)

- **Input:** `1`
   - Remainder: `1`
   - Result: `1 - 1 = 0` (Correct)

- **Input:** `9`
   - Remainder: `9`
   - Result: `9 + (10 - 9) = 10` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program handles all cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly rounds the integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0, and it accounts for edge cases as well. 

Thus, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
