The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. The value of `n` is an input integer, so `remainder` will be the last digit of that integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`**
