Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer and not divisible by 10. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the printed value is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, the printed value is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
