To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already ending with 0, it remains unchanged. The rounding logic is as follows:
- If `n` ends with 0, return `n`.
- If `n` ends with a digit from 1 to 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- If `n` ends with a digit from 6 to 9, round up to the nearest multiple of 10.

### Program Code:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Divisibility by 10**: The first condition checks if `n` is divisible by 10. If true, it prints `n`, which is correct as per the problem statement.
2. **Rounding down**: The second condition checks if the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5. If true, it calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. This is also correct.
3. **Rounding up**: The final condition handles cases where the last digit is greater than 5. It calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which correctly rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10.

### Edge Cases:
- **n = 0**: The output will be `0`, which is correct.
- **n = 5**: The output can be either `0` or `10`, which is acceptable as both are valid nearest multiples of 10.
- **n = 10**: The output will be `10`, which is correct.
- **n = 15**: The output will be `10`, which is correct.
- **n = 16**: The output will be `20`, which is correct.
- **n = 1000000000**: The output will be `1000000000`, which is correct.

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm the logic implemented in the code:
- It states that if `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`.
- If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`.
- If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. The output hints agree with the logic of the code.

Correctness: **True**.
