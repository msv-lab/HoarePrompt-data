The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\), the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within that range. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
