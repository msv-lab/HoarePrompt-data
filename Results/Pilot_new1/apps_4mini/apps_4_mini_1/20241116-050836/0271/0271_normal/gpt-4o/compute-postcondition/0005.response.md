The variable `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, and it is given that `remainder` is greater than 5. This means that `remainder` can take values from 6 to 9. 

The expression `result = n + (10 - remainder)` will be evaluated based on the value of `remainder`. 

1. If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`.
2. If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`.
3. If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`.
4. If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`.

Thus, depending on the specific value of `remainder`, `result` will be `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` and greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10` and greater than 5; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1**
