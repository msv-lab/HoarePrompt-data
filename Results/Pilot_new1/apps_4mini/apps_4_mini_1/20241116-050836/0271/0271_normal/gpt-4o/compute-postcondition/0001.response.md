The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range 0 to 10^9, so `remainder` will hold the last digit of `n`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10**
