The variable `remainder` is not defined in the initial state, so we need to calculate it based on the value of `n`. The remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is `n % 10`, which is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 5 as per the initial state. Thus, `remainder` can take values from 0 to 5. 

The calculation for `result` is `n - remainder`. Since `remainder` can take any value from 0 to 5, `result` will thus vary accordingly. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is `n % 10` (where `remainder` is in the range [0, 5]), and `result` is `n - remainder` (where `result` will be in the range [n, n-5]).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, and `result` is `n - remainder`**
