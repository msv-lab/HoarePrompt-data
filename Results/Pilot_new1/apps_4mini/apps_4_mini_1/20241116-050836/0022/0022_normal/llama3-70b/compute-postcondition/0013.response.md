The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, so `s` is still a string input of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1 < n // 2`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1 < n // 2`, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string input of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k + 1 < n // 2`, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
