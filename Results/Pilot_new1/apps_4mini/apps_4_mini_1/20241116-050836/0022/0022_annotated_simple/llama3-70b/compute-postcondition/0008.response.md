According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which means it will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. 

Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1, allowing the loop to continue. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 1 for the next iteration, while `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is 1**
