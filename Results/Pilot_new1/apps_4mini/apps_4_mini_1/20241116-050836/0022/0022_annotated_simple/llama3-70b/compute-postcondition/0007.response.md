Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is initially True, and `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If the characters do match, `is_spalindrome` remains True, and the program continues to check other characters in the string.***
