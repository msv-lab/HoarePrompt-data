According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is the length of the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `n // 2` must be at least 1, meaning that `n` must be at least 2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `n // 2 - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` should initially be 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 0**
