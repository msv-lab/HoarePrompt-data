The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks whether it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The function first determines the length of the string `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the function considers the string to be trivially a palindrome and returns `True`. If `n` is 2 or greater, it iterates through the first half of the string, comparing characters from the start and end. If any characters do not match, the function returns `False`. If all characters match throughout the loop, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is indeed a palindrome.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome or trivially a palindrome (if its length is less than 2); otherwise, it returns `False` if `s` is not a palindrome. **
