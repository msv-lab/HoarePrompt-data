The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, which changes its previous value from `True` to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1` of `s.**
