Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `m` is a positive integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers ranging from 1 to `m`, `k` is a list of `m` integers such that the sum of `k` is at least 1 and at most `n`, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`. If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, implying that not all counts match the desired counts. Additionally, at least one value in `current_counts` has been adjusted to equal its corresponding value in `desired_counts` prior to the execution of this check.***
