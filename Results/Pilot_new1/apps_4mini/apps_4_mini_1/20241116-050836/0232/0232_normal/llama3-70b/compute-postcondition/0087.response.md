The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. This assignment does not affect any of the previously defined variables, which include `color_counts`, `found`, `j`, `i`, and `n`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged except for the new variable `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is False, `j` is `i + 1`, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
