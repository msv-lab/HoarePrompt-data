Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, allowing for the possibility that `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or its previous value plus 1. If this condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, `found` remains unchanged.***
