Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. In either case, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`.***
