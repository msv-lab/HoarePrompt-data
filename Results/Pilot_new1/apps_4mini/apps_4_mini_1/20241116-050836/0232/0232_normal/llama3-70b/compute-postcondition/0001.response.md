The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, where the input is split into strings and then each string is converted to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `counts` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `counts`, along with the new assignment of `colors`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers from input, and `counts` remains unchanged**.
