The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The other variables (`color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**.
