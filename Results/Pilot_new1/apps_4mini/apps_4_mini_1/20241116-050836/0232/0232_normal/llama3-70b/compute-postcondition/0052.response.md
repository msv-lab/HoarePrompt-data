Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty, `found` unchanged, `i` remaining at 0, and `j` not being defined.***
