Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is equal to `colors[j]`. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
