The loop iterates over each element in the `colors` list and counts the occurrences of each color by updating the `color_counts` dictionary. If a color is encountered for the first time, it initializes its count to 0 before incrementing it. 

If the `colors` list contains at least one element, the loop will execute once for each element in the list. If the list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the `color_counts` dictionary will remain empty.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and each value is the count of occurrences of that color. If `colors` is empty, `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.**
