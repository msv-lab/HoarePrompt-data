Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary that will contain the key `color` (equal to `colors[1]`) with a value of 0 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. `j` is 1.***
