Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or its previous value plus 1, if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the values in `window_counts` do not match `counts`, `found` remains unchanged.***
