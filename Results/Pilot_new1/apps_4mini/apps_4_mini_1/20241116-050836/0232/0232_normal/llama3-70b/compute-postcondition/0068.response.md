Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
