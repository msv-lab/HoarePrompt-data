Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The variables `found`, `j`, `i`, and `n` maintain their stated conditions, where `found` is True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding elements in `counts`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than `i + 2.***
