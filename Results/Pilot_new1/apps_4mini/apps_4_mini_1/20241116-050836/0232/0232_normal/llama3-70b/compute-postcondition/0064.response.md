Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary, `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is not met, the program continues execution without changing the state of `found`, `i`, `n`, or `j`.***
