The variables `n` and `m` are assigned values from the input, where `map(int, input().split())` splits the input string into two parts and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are unknown but constrained by the conditions given (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n). Other variables, `colors` and `counts`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and the values of `colors` and `counts` remain unchanged.**
