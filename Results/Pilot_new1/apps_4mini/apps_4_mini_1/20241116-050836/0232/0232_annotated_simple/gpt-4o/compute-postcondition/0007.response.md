Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, and `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} `k_{i}` ≤ `n`. If the `current_counts` of each color matches the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. If they do not match, the function does not return anything (or continues execution).***
