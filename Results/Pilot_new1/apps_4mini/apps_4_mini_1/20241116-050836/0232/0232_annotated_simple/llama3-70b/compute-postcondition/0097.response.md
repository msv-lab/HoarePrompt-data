Postcondition: ***`found` is False initially, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`, and `window_counts` contains `color` with an updated value. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` for all elements, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the state of `window_counts` and the indices `i` and `j` remain unchanged.***
