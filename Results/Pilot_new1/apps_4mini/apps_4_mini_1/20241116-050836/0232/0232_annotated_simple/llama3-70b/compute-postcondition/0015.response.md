Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers, `colors` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `color` is the third element in the `colors` list, and if `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
