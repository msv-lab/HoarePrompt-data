The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, which changes its previous state from `False` to `True`. The other variables, `window_counts` and `j`, remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains `color` with an updated count, `found` is True, `j` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`window_counts` contains `color` with an updated count, `found` is True, `j` is `i + 1**
