According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is initialized to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (i.e., `i` can be equal to `n - 1`, which is 0 or greater). 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will start at `i` and will increment until it reaches `n`. Therefore, before the loop starts, `window_counts` being an empty dictionary does not affect the execution of the loop. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `n` is greater than `0` and set `j` to `i` (which is `n - 1`).

State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
