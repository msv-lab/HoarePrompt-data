Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary of color counts, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `m` is an integer, and `counts` is a list of integers. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
