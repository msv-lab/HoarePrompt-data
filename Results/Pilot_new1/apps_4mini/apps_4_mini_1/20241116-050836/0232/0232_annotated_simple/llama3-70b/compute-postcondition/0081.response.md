According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is not specified but is implied to be greater than `i` for the loop to have executed at least once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented. Since the loop starts with `j` at `i`, the next value of `j` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `i + 1`. The value of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not specified to change.
