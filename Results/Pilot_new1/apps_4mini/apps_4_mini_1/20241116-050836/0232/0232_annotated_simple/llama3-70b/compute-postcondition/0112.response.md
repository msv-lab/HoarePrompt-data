The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
