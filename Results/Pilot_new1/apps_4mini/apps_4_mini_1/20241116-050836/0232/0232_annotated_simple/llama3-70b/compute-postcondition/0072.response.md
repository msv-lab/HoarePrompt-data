Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains `color`, if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the counts do not match, the state remains unchanged with respect to `found`, which would still be False or retain its previous value.***
