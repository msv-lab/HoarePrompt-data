Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `colors` is a list of integers with at least one element, `color` is the first element in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers, and `color_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already a key in `color_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
