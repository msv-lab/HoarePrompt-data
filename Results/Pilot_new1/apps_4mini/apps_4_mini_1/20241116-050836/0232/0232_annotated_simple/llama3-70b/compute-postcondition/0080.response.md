Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains `color` with an updated count. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the state of `window_counts` and `found` is unchanged.***
