The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of the `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary by 1. Since `color` was previously updated in `window_counts` to include its count, it will either increase an existing count or initialize it if it was not present. The other variables (`color`, `color_counts`, `found`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated count for `color` in `window_counts`.

Output State: **`color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `found` remains False, and `j` is equal to n.**
