Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `i` remains unchanged; `n` is greater than `i + 2; `j` is equal to `i + 2; `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
