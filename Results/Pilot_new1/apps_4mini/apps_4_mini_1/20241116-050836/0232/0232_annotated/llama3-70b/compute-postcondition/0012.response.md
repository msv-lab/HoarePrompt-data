The variable `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, it is initialized to 0 before the increment, resulting in `color_counts[color]` being 1 after execution. If `color` is already present, its previous value is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a new list of integers reflecting the updated counts, and `color` is the second element of `colors`, and `color_counts[color]` is updated accordingly.
