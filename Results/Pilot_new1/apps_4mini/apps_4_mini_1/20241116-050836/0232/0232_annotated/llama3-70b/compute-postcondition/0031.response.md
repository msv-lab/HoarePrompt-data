Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts. If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `found` remains False, and the state of other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`) is unchanged, while `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1.***
