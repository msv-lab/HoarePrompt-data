Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, which indicates that the current window of counts satisfies the required conditions. If the condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, effectively stopping further iterations. If the condition is not met, the program continues execution without altering the values of `found`, `window_counts`, `i`, `j`, or `color`.***
