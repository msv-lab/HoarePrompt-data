Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` remains unchanged. If the counts of the sorted values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the counts do not match, the program continues with the next iteration without any change to `found`, `i`, or `j`.***
