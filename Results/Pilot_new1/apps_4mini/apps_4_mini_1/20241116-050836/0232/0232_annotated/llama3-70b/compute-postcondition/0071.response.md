The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[n]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `found` is True, and `j` is equal to n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
