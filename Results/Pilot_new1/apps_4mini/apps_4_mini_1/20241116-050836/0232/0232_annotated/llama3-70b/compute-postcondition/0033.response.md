The variable `j` is defined as `i + 1`, and it is used to access the `colors` list at index `j`. The value of `color` is assigned the value at `colors[j]`. The states of the other variables `color_counts`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `color` is now assigned the value from the `colors` list at index `j`.

Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]**
