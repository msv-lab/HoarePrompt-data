Postcondition: ***If `found` is True, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `window_counts` unchanged. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, or if `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being empty and `found` remaining False. Thus, if `found` is False, `window_counts` remains unchanged and empty.***
