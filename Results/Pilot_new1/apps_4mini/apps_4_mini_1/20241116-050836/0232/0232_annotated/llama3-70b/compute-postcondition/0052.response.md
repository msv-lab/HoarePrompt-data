Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `window_counts` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` to `n-1`. If `found` is True, the loop breaks, and the values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. If `found` is False, the state of `window_counts` remains unchanged, and `i`, `n`, and `j` also remain unchanged, preserving their initial values.***
