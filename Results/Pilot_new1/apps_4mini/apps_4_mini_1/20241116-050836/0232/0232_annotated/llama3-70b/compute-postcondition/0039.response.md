Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts; `i` and `n` remain unchanged; `j` is equal to `i + 1`; `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts in `window_counts` match the `counts` based on the sorted values, then `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged, and the loop continues.***
