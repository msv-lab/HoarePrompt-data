Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0, while the state of `window_counts` remains unchanged for other keys. If `color` is already present, `window_counts[color]` retains its previous value. The variable `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
