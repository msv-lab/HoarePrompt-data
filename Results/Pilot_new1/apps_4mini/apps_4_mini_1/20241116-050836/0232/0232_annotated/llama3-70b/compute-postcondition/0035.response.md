Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with keys as unique colors and values as counts, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; otherwise, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
