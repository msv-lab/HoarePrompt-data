Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a new list of integers, and `color` is the first element of `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; if `color` is already in `color_counts`, no changes are made to `color_counts`.***
