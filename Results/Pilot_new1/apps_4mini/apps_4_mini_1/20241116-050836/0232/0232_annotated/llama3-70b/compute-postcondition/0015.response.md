Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers with at least 3 elements, and `color` is the third element of `colors`. If `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is set to 0, ensuring that it is initialized. No changes are made to `color_counts` if `color` is already present. The list `counts` reflects the updated counts based on this operation.***
