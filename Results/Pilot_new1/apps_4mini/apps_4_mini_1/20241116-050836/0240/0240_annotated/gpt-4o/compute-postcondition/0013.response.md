According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. Given that `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the permutations will continue as long as there are more permutations to process.

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is already assigned to the next permutation, we need to consider what the next state will be at the start of the next iteration.

1. The variable `perm` will be updated to the next permutation in the next iteration of the loop.
2. The loop will continue until all permutations have been generated. Since `perm` is the next permutation, we need to ensure that it is updated accordingly.

To summarize, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `perm` must be updated to reflect the next permutation of `chars`.
- Since `candidate` is derived from `perm`, it will also need to be updated to the string representation of the new `perm`.

Since we have no constraints on `chars` other than it being a non-empty string of digits, we don't need to adjust `chars` or any other state variables.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string representation of the next `perm`**
