The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty string `sub`. It returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str` and both strings have the same length. Otherwise, it returns False. However, the code does not account for cases where `num_str` may be empty or if `sub` is longer than `num_str`, which would always result in a False return in those scenarios.
