According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations of `chars`. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the elements in `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation needs to be generated. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation, we need to ensure that `perm` is updated to the next permutation in the sequence. Thus, `perm` will be the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` will be equal to this new `perm`. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as `chars` remains unchanged and is still a non-empty string of digits.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
