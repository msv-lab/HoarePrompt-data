`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of the `perm` string into a new string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
