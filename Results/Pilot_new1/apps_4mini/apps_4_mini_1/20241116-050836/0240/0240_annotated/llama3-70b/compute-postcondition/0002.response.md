According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, the string `s` must not be empty. Given that `s` is specified to contain digits and has a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it is possible for `s` to be empty, but in this case, it is stated that it is a string containing digits. Therefore, we can assume that `s` contains at least one digit.

Since the loop will iterate over the characters in `s`, we can also infer that `c` will take on the value of each character in the string during the iterations. 

For the loop to execute:
- `s` must contain at least one character (which it does, as it is a string containing digits).
- `c` will start as the first character of `s` during the first iteration.

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted are:
- `s` is a string containing digits with a length of at least 1.
- `c` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string containing digits with a length of at least 1, `c` is the first character of `s`**
