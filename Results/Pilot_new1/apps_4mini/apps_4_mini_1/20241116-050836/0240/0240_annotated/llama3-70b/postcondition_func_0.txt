The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`, constructs a new string by concatenating characters from `s` that are also in `t` with `t`, and returns the integer representation of the resulting string. If `s` is empty or contains no matching characters, the function returns the integer representation of `t`. If the resulting string is not a valid integer, it raises a `ValueError`.
