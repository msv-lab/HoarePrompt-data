The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`. It constructs a new string `n` by concatenating characters from `s` that are also present in `t`. After this, it appends the entire string `t` to `n`. Finally, the function attempts to return the integer representation of the resulting string `n`.

However, there are important edge cases to consider:
1. If `s` is empty, `n` will be equal to `t`, and the function will return the integer representation of `t`.
2. If `s` contains no characters that are in `t`, `n` will still be equal to `t`, and the function will return the integer representation of `t`.
3. If the resulting string `n` contains non-numeric characters after concatenation (which can happen if `t` includes characters that are not digits), the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert `n` to an integer.

Thus, the functionality of the function is to extract characters from `s` that are present in `t`, concatenate them with `t`, and return the integer representation of the resulting string. If the resulting string is not a valid integer, it will raise an error.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a non-empty string `t`, constructs a new string by concatenating characters from `s` that are also in `t` with `t`, and returns the integer representation of the resulting string. If `s` is empty or contains no matching characters, the function returns the integer representation of `t`. If the resulting string is not a valid integer, it raises a `ValueError`. **
