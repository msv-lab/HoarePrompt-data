To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and annotations, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Vasya sends a number `n` as a string, appending the number of digits in `n` (denoted as `k`).
2. The received string is shuffled, and Vasya remembers a non-empty substring `t` of `n`.
3. The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` that could have been sent.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(s, t)` takes two strings: `s` (the shuffled string) and `t` (the remembered substring). 

1. It creates a set `t_set` from `t` to quickly check which characters from `s` are present in `t`.
2. It initializes an empty string `n` and iterates through each character `c` in `s`. If `c` is found in `t_set`, it appends `c` to `n`.
3. After the loop, it appends `t` to `n`.
4. Finally, it converts the resulting string `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Annotations:
The annotations describe the behavior of the function in various scenarios, particularly focusing on:
- If `s` is empty or contains no characters present in `t_set`, `n` will only contain `t`.
- The function returns the integer representation of `n`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states that the integer representation of `n` should not have leading zeros unless `n` is zero itself. However, the current implementation does not handle leading zeros properly. For example, if `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the function constructs `n` as `"30021"`, which is correct. But if `s = "0000"` and `t = "01"`, the function will return `1` instead of `10`, which is not the smallest integer representation.
2. **Character Selection**: The function only constructs `n` from characters in `s` that are also in `t`. This may not yield the smallest possible `n` because it does not consider all characters in `s` that could lead to a smaller `n` when combined with `t`.

### Examples:
- For `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the output is `30021`, which is correct.
- For `s = "0000"` and `t = "01"`, the output will be `1`, which is incorrect because the smallest possible integer `n` should be `10`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, particularly in terms of leading zeros and ensuring the smallest integer representation. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
