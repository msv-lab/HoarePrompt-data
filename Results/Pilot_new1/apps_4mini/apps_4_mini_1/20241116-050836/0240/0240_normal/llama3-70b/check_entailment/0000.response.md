To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description and the output hints, we need to analyze both the code and the expected behavior as described.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a string `s` that contains digits (which may be shuffled) and a substring `t` of `n`. The output must be the smallest integer `n` that can be formed, ensuring that `n` does not have leading zeros unless it's the number zero itself.

### Analyzing the Code:
The function `func_1` does the following:
1. It initializes an empty string `n`.
2. It constructs `n` by iterating through each character in the string `s`. If a character in `s` is also in `t`, it appends that character to `n`.
3. After iterating through `s`, it appends the entire string `t` to `n`.
4. Finally, it converts `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeros**: If `s` contains leading zeros and no other digits (e.g., `s = "000012"` and `t = "01"`), the code might generate `n` as `0001` which would convert to `1`. However, if `t` is also leading with `0` (like `t = "01"`), the final integer will still be `1`. This might not be the smallest integer representation if `t` contains leading zeros.
2. **No Characters from `t` in `s`**: If `s` does not contain any characters from `t`, `n` will just be `t`. This means that if `t` is `01`, the output will be `1`, which is valid but may not represent the smallest integer possible if other digits in `s` could have formed a smaller integer.
3. **All Characters in `t` being in `s`**: The order of characters in `n` matters. If `s` contains all characters of `t` but in a different order, the smallest integer may not be formed correctly.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state that the function constructs `n` by including characters from `s` that are present in `t`, and then appends `t` to `n`. It also mentions that if `s` contains no characters from `t`, `n` will still include `t`. This aligns with the code but does not address potential issues with leading zeros or the smallest integer formation.

### Conclusion:
The code does not guarantee that the smallest integer `n` is formed based on the conditions laid out in the problem description because:
- It does not handle cases where leading zeros in `t` could affect the smallest integer formation.
- It does not ensure that the digits from `s` are used in a way that minimizes the integer value of `n`.

Given these considerations, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
