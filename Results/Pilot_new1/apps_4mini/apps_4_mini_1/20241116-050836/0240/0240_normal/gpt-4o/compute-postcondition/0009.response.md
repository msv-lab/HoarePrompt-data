According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `permutations(chars)` function. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. 

To execute one more time, we need to ensure that `perm` is updated to the third permutation of `chars`. Since `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, the total number of permutations will be greater than 2, allowing for further iterations.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `perm` needs to be updated to the third permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars`**
