To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, we will analyze the code and the hints step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` that contains `n` followed by the digit count of `n`, and a substring `sub` of `n`.

### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(s, sub)`**
   - It calculates `n_len`, which is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`.
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of characters in `s` and `sub`, then removes the counts of `sub` from `s`.
   - It generates possible numbers from the remaining characters and finds the smallest.

2. **Function 2: `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**
   - It checks if `sub` is in `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`.
   - However, `n_len` is not defined within this function, which will cause a `NameError`.

3. **Function 3: `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**
   - It generates permutations of the characters and checks if they are valid using `is_valid_number`.
   - There is no handling for cases where `chars` is empty or where `sub` might not be valid.

### Edge Cases:
- The most significant issue arises from `is_valid_number` due to the undefined variable `n_len`. This will lead to a runtime error when the function is called.
- The function does not handle cases where there are no remaining characters after subtracting `sub` from `s`, which could lead to an empty permutation scenario.

### Output Hints Analysis:
- **Hint for Function 1**: It correctly describes what the function does, but it mentions a potential error if `sub` contains characters not in `s` or if there are no remaining characters. This aligns with our findings.
- **Hint for Function 2**: It correctly notes that the function will raise a `NameError` due to the undefined `n_len`.
- **Hint for Function 3**: It accurately describes the function's behavior but fails to mention the lack of handling for invalid permutations or empty cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description correctly because:
- The `is_valid_number` function will raise a `NameError`, preventing the program from functioning correctly.
- There are potential edge cases where the program could fail or not return the expected results, particularly when there are no remaining characters.

Thus, since the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
