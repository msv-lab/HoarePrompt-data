Output State: **If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will generate all permutations of `chars` and for each permutation `perm`, `candidate` will be equal to that permutation. If `candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number` when evaluated with `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` consists of only one character, the loop executes once, and `candidate` will be that single character. If `sub` is not a valid comparison for any permutation, no candidates will be yielded despite the loop executing.**
