The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the iterable `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
