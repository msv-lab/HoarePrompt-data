According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` string and the `permutations` function. The `permutations(chars)` generates all possible permutations of the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. The permutations are generated in a specific order, and since `perm` is currently the third permutation, the next permutation would be the fourth permutation of `chars`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `perm` should be updated to the fourth permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` should also be updated to the same value as `perm` since it is stated that `candidate` is the same as `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the same as `perm`.**
