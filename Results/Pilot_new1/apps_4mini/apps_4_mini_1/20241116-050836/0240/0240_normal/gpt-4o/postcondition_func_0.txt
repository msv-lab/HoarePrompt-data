The function accepts a string `s` representing a sequence of digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters found in `sub`, then generates a list of possible numbers from these remaining characters. Finally, it returns the minimum value from this list of possible numbers. If `sub` contains characters not found in `s`, those characters do not affect the outcome. If there are no remaining characters after the subtraction, it may lead to an error in generating possible numbers or finding the minimum, which should be considered as a potential edge case.
