According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The variable `perm` represents the current permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` is initially set to the first permutation of `chars`, it indicates that the loop has executed at least once.

For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. The `permutations` function generates permutations in a specific order, so after the first permutation, the next permutation will be the second one.

Since `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, it will have multiple permutations. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `perm` should be updated to the next permutation of `chars`.

Since `candidate` is equal to `perm` and is based on the current value of `perm`, it will also need to be updated to reflect this change. 

We also need to ensure that `candidate` is valid with respect to `sub` for the next iteration, but since the prompt does not specify any changes to `sub`, we will keep it as is.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` is equal to the second permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to the second permutation of `chars`.**
