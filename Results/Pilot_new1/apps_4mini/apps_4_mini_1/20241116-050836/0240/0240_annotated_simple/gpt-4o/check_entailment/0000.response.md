To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the code and the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The program aims to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a given string `s`, which contains a shuffled version of `n` followed by the number of digits in `n`. The substring `sub` is a known part of `n`. The goal is to find the smallest valid `n` such that it contains `sub` and is formed by the digits in `s`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1: `func_1(s, sub)`**
   - It calculates the length of `n` (`n_len`) based on the length of `s` and `sub`.
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each digit in `s` and `sub`.
   - It decrements the count of characters in `s` based on the characters in `sub`.
   - It generates all possible numbers from the remaining characters and finds the smallest valid number.

2. **Function 2: `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**
   - It checks if `sub` is a substring of `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` matches `n_len`.

3. **Function 3: `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**
   - It generates all permutations of the remaining characters and yields valid candidates according to the `is_valid_number`.

### Potential Issues
- **Leading Zeroes:** The program does not explicitly handle the case of leading zeroes in the generated numbers. If `n` is reconstructed incorrectly, it may lead to results that do not satisfy the leading zero condition unless `n` is exactly "0".
- **Performance:** The use of permutations can lead to a factorial time complexity, which may not be feasible for larger inputs (up to 1,000,000 characters).

### Example of Failure
Consider the input:
- `s = "000123"`
- `sub = "01"`

The expected output should be the smallest integer `n` that contains `sub` and uses digits from `s`. However, the permutations generated might include invalid leading zeroes, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion
Given the leading zero issue and the potential for incorrect outputs in certain cases, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
