According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The loop will execute again if there are more permutations available. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. 

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The `permutations(chars)` function generates all possible arrangements of the characters in `chars`. If `perm` is currently the second permutation, the next permutation would be the third one.
2. The variable `perm` needs to be updated to reflect the next permutation in the sequence.

Given that `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the total number of permutations will depend on the length of `chars`. If `chars` has at least 3 digits, there will be more permutations available.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
