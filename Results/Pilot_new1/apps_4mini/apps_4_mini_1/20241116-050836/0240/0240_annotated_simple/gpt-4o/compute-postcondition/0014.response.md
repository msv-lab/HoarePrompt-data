Output State: **If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will generate all permutations of `chars`, yielding each `candidate` that is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only one digit, the loop will execute once, yielding that single digit if it is valid according to the `is_valid_number` function. Additionally, if there are no valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the `is_valid_number` condition with respect to `sub`, then no candidates will be yielded despite the loop executing.**
