The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator function without terminating it. In this case, `candidate` is yielded, and its value is equal to `perm`. The values of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**
