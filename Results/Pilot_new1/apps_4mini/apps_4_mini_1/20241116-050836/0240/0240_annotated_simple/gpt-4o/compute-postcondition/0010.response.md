The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is already defined as the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold that same string value. The other variables, `chars` and `perm`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
