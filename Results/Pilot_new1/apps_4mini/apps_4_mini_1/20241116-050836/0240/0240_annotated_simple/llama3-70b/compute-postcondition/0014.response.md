The value of `n` is incremented by `t`. Since `n` is a string containing all characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`, and given the initial state indicates that `n` is a string, the value of `t` is appended to `n`. The previous value of `n` is a string, and the output state reflects the updated value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is the original string plus `t`, and `t` is appended to `n`**
