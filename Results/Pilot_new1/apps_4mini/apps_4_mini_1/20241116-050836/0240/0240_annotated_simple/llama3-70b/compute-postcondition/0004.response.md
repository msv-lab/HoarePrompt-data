The variable `n` is assigned the value of `n + c`. Since `n` is currently an empty string and `c` is the first character of `s`, which is also an element of `t_set`, the operation `n += c` concatenates `c` to `n`. Thus, `n` will now contain the character `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `t_set` contains the unique characters from `t`, `n` is the character `c`, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `c` is an element of `t_set`.**
