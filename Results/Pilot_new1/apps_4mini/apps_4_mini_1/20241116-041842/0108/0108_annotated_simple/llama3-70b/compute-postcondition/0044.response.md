Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` of lowercase English letters and processes it to create a new string `res` that consists of each letter from `s` repeated based on its occurrences. Each occurrence of a letter is replaced by the next character in ASCII order. If the length of `res` equals 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` contains no characters from the English alphabet or characters beyond 'z', `res` remains empty, and the function will print -1. The function does not return any value. **
