The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. Since `res` already contains the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s`, this operation adds one more occurrence of `char` to `res`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus three additional `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `s` still contains `char`.

Output State: **`res` is the concatenation of `char` for each occurrence found in `s` plus three additional `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `s` still contains `char`**
