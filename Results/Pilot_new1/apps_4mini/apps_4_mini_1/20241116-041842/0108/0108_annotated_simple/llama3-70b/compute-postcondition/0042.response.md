Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of each character from `s` repeated based on its occurrences, with each occurrence replaced in `s` by the next character in ASCII order. If the length of `res` is equal to 26, the function prints `res`. If the length of `res` is not equal to 26, the function prints -1. In both cases, `s` remains unchanged, and if `s` contains no characters from `alphabet` or includes characters beyond 'z', `res` remains an empty string. Additionally, if `s` is empty, `res` will also be empty and the loop does not execute.***
