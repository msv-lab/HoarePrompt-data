The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `s`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `i` is the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26, and the function prints -1**
