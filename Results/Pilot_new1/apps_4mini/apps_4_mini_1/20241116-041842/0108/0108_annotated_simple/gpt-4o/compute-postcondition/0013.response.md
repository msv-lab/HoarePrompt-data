The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is either 0 or 1 and less than `target_len`, after execution, `j` will be either 1 or 2. The states of the other variables (`s` and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is less than `len(s) - 1**
