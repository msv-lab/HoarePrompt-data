Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 and less than `target_len`. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being either 1 or 2. If the characters do not match, `j` remains unchanged, still either 0 or 1 and less than `target_len`.***
