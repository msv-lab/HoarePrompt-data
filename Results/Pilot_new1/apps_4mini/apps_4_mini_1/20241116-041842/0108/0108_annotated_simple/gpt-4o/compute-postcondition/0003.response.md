The values of `i` and `j` are both initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are `s` (a string of lowercase English letters based on user input), `target` (which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'), and `target_len` (which is 26). The initialization of `i` and `j` does not change the values of `s`, `target`, or `target_len`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters based on user input; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters based on user input; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
