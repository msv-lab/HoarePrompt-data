Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters based on user input; if the first character of `s` is equal to 'a', then `j` is incremented to 1, while `i` remains 0. If the first character of `s` is not 'a', `j` remains 0, and `i` is still 0. The value of `j` indicates how many characters from `target` have been matched so far.***
