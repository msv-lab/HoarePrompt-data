The variable `target` is assigned the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, but it is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `s` and the newly assigned value of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
