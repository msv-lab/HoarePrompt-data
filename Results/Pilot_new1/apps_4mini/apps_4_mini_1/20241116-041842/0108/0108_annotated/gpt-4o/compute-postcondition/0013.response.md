The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`i`, `s`, and `target`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is less than len(s) - 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `target` is unchanged, and `j` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`i` is less than len(s) - 1, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 1, `target` is unchanged, and `j` is increased by 1**
