Output State: **If `s` contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z', then `res` will contain all occurrences of characters from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, and `s` will consist of characters that are not in the alphabet or will be empty if all were replaced. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z' initially, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain empty while `s` will remain unchanged. If `s` has characters beyond 'z', those will not be affected by the loop.**
