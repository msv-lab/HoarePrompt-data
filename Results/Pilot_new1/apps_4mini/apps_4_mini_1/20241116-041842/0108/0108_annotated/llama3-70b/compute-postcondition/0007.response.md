The code `res += char` appends the value of `char`, which is 'b', to the end of the string `res`, which is currently 'a'. After execution, `res` will be 'ab'. The values of the other variables `s`, `alphabet`, and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is the modified string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is the modified string with the first 'a' replaced by 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` is 'b'**
