According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `alphabet`. The loop will execute regardless of the contents of the string `s` since it only depends on the `alphabet`. The variable `char` will take on each character from `alphabet` in each iteration. The initial state of `res` being an empty string does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, the only necessary states are the initial values of `char` and `alphabet`. The variable `char` does not need to be defined before the loop starts, as it will be assigned during the first iteration. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in `alphabet`**
