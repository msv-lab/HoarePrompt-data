The value of `res` is updated by appending `char` to it. The previous state of `res` contains all occurrences of 'a', and `char` is defined as the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`. Therefore, after executing the code, `res` will now contain all occurrences of 'a' plus the new character `char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of 'a' plus `char`; `s` contains the original `char`; `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the previous `char`**
