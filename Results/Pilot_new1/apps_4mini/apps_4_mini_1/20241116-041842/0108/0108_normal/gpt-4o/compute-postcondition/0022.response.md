Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` is the length of `s`, and `j` is the count of letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If `j` equals 26, the function prints `target`. If `j` is less than 26, indicating that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, or if `s` is empty or contains no letters, the function prints -1.***
