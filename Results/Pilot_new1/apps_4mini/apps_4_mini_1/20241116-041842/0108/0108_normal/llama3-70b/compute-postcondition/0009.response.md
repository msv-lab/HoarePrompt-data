According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is present in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'b', and `char` must be equal to 'b' for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be adjusted to be equal to 'b'.

State: **`s` is 'b', `res` is updated by adding `char`, and `char` is 'b'**
