The code snippet updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that follows it in the alphabet (which is obtained by adding 1 to the ASCII value of `char`). The variable `res` is updated to include `char`, but since `res` already contains occurrences of `char`, it is not directly affected by this operation. The state of `s` changes as it now contains one less occurrence of `char` and one more occurrence of the character that follows `char`.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all occurrences of `char`, `char` is the previous character in the alphabet that is in `s`, and `s` is updated to reflect the replacement of `char` with the next character in the alphabet.

Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of `char`, `char` is the previous character in the alphabet that is in `s`, and `s` is updated to include the next character in the alphabet.**
