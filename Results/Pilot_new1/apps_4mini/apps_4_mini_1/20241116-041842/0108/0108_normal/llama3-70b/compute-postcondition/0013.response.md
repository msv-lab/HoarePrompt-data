Output State: **`if s contains at least one 'a', then res is equal to the count of 'a' in the original string, s will have the first 'a' replaced by 'b' and continue replacing subsequent 'a's with 'b's until no 'a' remains. If s does not contain 'a', the loop does not execute, res remains an empty string, and s remains unchanged. After the loop, char will be 'c' if there were any 'a's in s, otherwise, it will be 'a'.`**
