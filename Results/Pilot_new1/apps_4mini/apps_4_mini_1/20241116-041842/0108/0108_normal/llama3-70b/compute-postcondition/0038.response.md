Postcondition: ***`res` contains all occurrences of each character from 'a' to 'z' in the order they are found in the original string `s`, and the length of `res` is exactly 26. The string `s` has been modified such that each character from 'a' to 'z' is replaced by its next character in the alphabet, while any characters outside of 'a' to 'z' remain unchanged.***
