Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of each character from 'a' to 'z' in the order they are found in the original string `s`, followed by the characters replaced in `s` until no occurrences of the current `char` remain. After the loop, `s` is modified accordingly with each character replaced by its next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string while `s` remains unchanged. If `s` contains characters outside of 'a' to 'z', those characters are unaffected by the loop, and `res` will only contain counts of the characters from 'a' to 'z' that were present in the original `s`.**
