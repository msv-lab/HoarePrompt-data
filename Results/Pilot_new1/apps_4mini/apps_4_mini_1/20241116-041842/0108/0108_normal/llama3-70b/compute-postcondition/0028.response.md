According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the previous character in the alphabet that is in `s`, and `s` has been updated to include the next character in the alphabet.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in `s`. Since `char` is the previous character in the alphabet, it must have been included in `s` before the update. Therefore, we need to ensure that after the update, `char` remains in `s`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `s` still contains `char` after the update. Thus, we can state that `s` must include `char`.

State: **`res` contains all occurrences of `char`, `char` is the previous character in the alphabet that is in `s`, and `s` currently includes `char`**
