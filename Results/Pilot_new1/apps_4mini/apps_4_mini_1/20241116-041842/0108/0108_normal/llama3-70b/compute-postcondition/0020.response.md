According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. The loop will continue executing as long as `char` is found in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is 'd', and `s` contains at least one occurrence of 'e'. This does not guarantee that 'd' is present in `s`, and thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must contain 'd'.

Since `s` currently contains at least one occurrence of 'e', we need to ensure that it also contains 'd'. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `s` must contain 'd' as well.

State: **`alphabet` contains characters after 'c', `char` is 'd', `s` now contains at least one occurrence of 'e' and `s` contains 'd'**
