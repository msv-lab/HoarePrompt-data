Output State: **`if char is in s then res` contains all occurrences of `char` followed by characters that replace `char` with the next character in the alphabet until `char` is no longer in `s`. After the loop, `char` is the next character after the last character found in `s`, and `s` is modified accordingly. If `char` is not in `s` at the start, the loop does not execute, `res` remains unchanged, and `s` remains the same.**
