The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as its signature shows no input parameters. Instead, it relies on external input, which consists of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and `n` lines of integers. Each line contains 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` where each integer satisfies the condition 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. 

The function processes this input and produces an output based on the provided conditions. However, the specific details of the output are not provided in the prompt.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process an integer `n` and `n` lines of integers, each containing 6 integers within the specified range. The exact nature of the output is not detailed, but it is implied that the function will return some result based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and n lines of 6 integers each (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), and processes this input to produce an output based on the specified conditions.**
