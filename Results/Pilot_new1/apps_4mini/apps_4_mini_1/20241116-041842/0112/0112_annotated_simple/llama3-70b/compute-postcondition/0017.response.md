Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lines of input, each containing 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It collects all unique digits from these inputs into a set, removes '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order and printing that integer. If no digits are available after processing, the function would raise a ValueError when attempting to convert an empty string to an integer. **
