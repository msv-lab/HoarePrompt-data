According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute if there is at least one cube in the `cubes` list. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it implies that `cubes` will contain at least one list (since `n` is at least 1). 

At the beginning of the loop, `cube` will be the first list in `cubes`. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to ensure that `cubes` contains at least one list, and `cube` is set to the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing at least 1 list of integers, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
