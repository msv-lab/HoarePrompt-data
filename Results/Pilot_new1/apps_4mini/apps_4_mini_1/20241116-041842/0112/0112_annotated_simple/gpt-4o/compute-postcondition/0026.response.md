The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, but it was already `False` before the assignment. Therefore, there is no change in the state of `found`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with at least one False value, `found` is False, `n` is between 1 and 3, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list**
