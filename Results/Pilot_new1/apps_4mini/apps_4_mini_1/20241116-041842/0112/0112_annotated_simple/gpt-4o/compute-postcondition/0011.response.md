The statement `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the value at index `i` of the `used_cubes` list to `True`. Since `i` is 1, the value at `used_cubes[1]` will be changed to `True`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the value at index 1 set to True, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is set to True if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`; if `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]`, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the value at index 1 set to True, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is set to True if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`; if `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]`, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.**
