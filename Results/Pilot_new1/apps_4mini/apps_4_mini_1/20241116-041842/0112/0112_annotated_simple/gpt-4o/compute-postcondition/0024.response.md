Postcondition: ***If `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` lists and `used_cubes[i]` is initially False, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True for that index, and `found` is set to True. If `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. Additionally, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop does not execute, resulting in `used_cubes` remaining a list of length `n` with all values set to False and `found` remaining False. In any case where `found` is False, the program returns False.***
