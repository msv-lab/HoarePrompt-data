To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and functionality based on the problem description.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n, cubes)`**:
   - This function initializes a variable `x` to 0 and enters a loop that checks if the next number (starting from 1) can be formed using the cubes.
   - The loop continues until `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns `False`, at which point it returns the last valid `x`.

2. **Function `can_form_number(num)`**:
   - This function checks if the number `num` can be formed using the cubes.
   - It converts the number to its digits and attempts to match each digit with the available cubes, marking cubes as used once a digit is matched.
   - If all digits can be matched with the cubes, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states that the number cannot contain leading zeros. However, the program does not check for this condition explicitly. For instance, if the cubes allow forming the number `01`, it would be treated as valid, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

2. **Digit Matching**: The program does not handle the case where the same digit is needed multiple times (such as forming `11`, `22`, etc.) correctly. If a digit appears multiple times in the number being formed, it must find separate cubes for each instance of that digit.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case of cubes containing only zeros correctly. For example, if the cubes are `[0, 0, 0]`, the program should return `0` since Masha cannot form any number at all.

### Example of Failure

Let's consider the following input:
```
3
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```
Here, Masha cannot form any number. The expected output is `0`, but the program would enter the loop and eventually return `1` because `can_form_number(1)` will return `False`, but it would not handle the scenario where all cubes are zeros correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description due to the lack of handling for leading zeros, digit matching, and specific edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
