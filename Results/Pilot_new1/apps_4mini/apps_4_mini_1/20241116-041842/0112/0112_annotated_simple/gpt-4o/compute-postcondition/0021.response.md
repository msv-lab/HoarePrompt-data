Output State: **If `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` lists and `used_cubes[i]` is initially False, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True for that index, and `found` is set to True. If `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains a list of length `n` with all values set to False and `found` remains False.**
