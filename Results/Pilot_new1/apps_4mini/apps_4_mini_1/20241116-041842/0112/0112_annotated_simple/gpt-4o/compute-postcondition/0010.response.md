According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Given that `i` is currently 0, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 1. Additionally, since `n` is at least 1 and can be up to 3, it remains unchanged.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 1.

The other states remain unchanged. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the value at index `i` set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is defined and contains at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is set to True if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`; if `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[i]`, `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.**
