According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the `digits` list has more elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with at least one False value, `found` is False, `n` is between 1 and 3, and `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `digits` must contain at least one more element after the current `digit`. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, we do not need to adjust `n`. However, we need to update `digit` to be the next digit in the `digits` list.

Assuming that `digit` was the last element of the `digits` list before the loop, we need to ensure that `digit` points to the next digit, and we need to confirm that `digits` has at least one more element.

State: **`used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with at least one False value, `found` is False, `n` is between 1 and 3, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, and `digits` has at least one more element**
