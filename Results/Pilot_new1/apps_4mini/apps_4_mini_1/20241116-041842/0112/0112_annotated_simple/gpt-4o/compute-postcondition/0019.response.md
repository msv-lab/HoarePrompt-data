Postcondition: ***`n` is 3, `i` is 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9, `num` is defined, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where `used_cubes[i]` is set to True if `digit` (the first element in `digits`) is found in `cube_faces[i]`, and `found` is set to True, indicating that a cube has been used. If `used_cubes[i]` was already True or `digit` is not present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged, and `found` remains False.***
