Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched with the faces of a set of cubes represented by `cube_faces`. It returns True if each digit can be matched to a different cube face, and False if any digit cannot be matched. Additionally, if `n` (the number of cube faces) is less than 1 or greater than 3, the function does not execute the matching logic and will return True since no digits would be checked. The function does not handle cases where `cube_faces` is not defined or is empty, which may lead to an error. **
