Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False, indicating that no match was found in the `cube_faces` for the given `digit`, and the state of `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, the function does not execute this block, and the state of `used_cubes` may have been modified based on previous logic not shown here.***
