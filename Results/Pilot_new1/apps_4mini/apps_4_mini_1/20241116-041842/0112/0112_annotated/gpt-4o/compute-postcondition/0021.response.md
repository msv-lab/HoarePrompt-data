Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where `used_cubes[i]` is set to True if `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, `found` is True if a match was found, and `i` is the index of the current cube being checked (0, 1, or 2). If `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` or if all `used_cubes[i]` are already True, then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` remains False, and `i` will equal n (indicating the loop completed without finding a match). If n is 0, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains a list of n False values, `found` is False, and `i` is 0.**
