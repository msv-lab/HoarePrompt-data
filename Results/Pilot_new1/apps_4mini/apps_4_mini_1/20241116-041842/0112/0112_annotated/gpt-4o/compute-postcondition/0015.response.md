According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n-1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index, and since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, the maximum value for `i` in the previous iteration would be `n-1`. Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, `i` must be incremented to `n`, and the loop will not execute again since `i` will no longer be less than `n`.

Thus, to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented to `n`, and we need to check the conditions for `used_cubes` and `cube_faces` to see if they still hold true for the next iteration.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, the only way for the loop to execute one more time is to have `n` increased to a value greater than the current maximum `i` (which is `n-1`). However, since `n` is fixed in the context of the loop, we cannot change `n` itself.

Therefore, the only adjustment we can make is to indicate that the loop will not execute again due to the current state of `i` being equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, and `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `i` is n**
