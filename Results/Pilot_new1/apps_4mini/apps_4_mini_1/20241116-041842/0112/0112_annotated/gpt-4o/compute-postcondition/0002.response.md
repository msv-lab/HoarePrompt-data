According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Given that `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` `False` values, the conditions for the loop to execute are satisfied as long as `digits` contains at least one element. 

At the start of the loop, we also need to consider the initial state of `digit`. Since `digit` will take on the values from the `digits` list, it should be set to the first element of the `digits` list during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digit` is the first digit in the digits list**
