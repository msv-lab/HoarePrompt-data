According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each `cube` in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the `cubes` list has at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be the fourth list in `cubes`. 

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `cubes` must have at least 4 lists.
- `cube` must be the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 4 lists; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of the elements in `cube`.**
