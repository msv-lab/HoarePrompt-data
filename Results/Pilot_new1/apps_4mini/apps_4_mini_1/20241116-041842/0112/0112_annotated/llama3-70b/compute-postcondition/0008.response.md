The `digits` set is updated to include string representations of the elements in `cube`. The `cube` list is the third list in `cubes`, and since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the specific contents of `cube` are not defined but can be assumed to contain integer values.

Since `digits` is updated with the string representations of the elements in `cube`, the output state will reflect the updated contents of `digits` based on the values in `cube`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of the elements in `cube`.**
