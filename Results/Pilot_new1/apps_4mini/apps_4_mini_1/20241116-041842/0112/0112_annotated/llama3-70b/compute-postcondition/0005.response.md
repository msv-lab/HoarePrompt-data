According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 2 lists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `digits` contains string representations of the digits in `cube`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the `cubes` list needs to have at least 2 lists. Additionally, `cube` should refer to the second list in `cubes` and `digits` should contain string representations of the digits in that second list.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` contains string representations of the digits in `cube`**
