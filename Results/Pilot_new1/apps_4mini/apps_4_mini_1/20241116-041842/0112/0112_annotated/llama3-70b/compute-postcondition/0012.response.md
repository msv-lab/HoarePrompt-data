The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since it is specified that '0' is an element of `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The other elements in `digits` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that '0' has been removed from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0'**
