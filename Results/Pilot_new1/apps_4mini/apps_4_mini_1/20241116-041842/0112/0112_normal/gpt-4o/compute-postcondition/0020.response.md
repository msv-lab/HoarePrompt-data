According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3, which means that the last value of `i` was 2 (since the loop iterates from 0 to n-1). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. 

This means that `n` must remain at 3, and `i` should be adjusted to 3. Other states like `digits` and `used_cubes` do not need to be modified for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length 3 filled with Boolean values, `i` is 3**
