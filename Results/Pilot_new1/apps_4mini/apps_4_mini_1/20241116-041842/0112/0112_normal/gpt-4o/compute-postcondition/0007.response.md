The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, so now `found` changes to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has the `i`-th element set to True, `found` is True, `i` is 0.
