The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the `i`-th cube has been used. The previous value of `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, and the other values in the list remain unchanged. The states of the other variables (`n`, `digits`, `found`, and `i`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has the `i`-th element set to True, `found` is False, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has the `i`-th element set to True, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
