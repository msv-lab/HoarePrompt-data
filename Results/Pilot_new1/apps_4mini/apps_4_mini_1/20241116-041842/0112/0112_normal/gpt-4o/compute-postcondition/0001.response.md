The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with `n` elements, all set to `False`. The value of `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, meaning `used_cubes` can have a length of 1, 2, or 3. The state of the variables `n` and `digits` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the initialization of `used_cubes` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of digits derived from the string representation of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of length n filled with False**
