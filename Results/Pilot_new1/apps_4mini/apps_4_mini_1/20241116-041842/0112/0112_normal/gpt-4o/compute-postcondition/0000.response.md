The variable `num` is not defined in the initial state, but it is implied that it would be an integer that could be derived from `n` or the elements of `cube_faces`. Assuming `num` is derived from `n` or is a valid integer within the constraints given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), the code converts `num` to a string, then creates a list of its digits.

However, without knowing the specific value of `num`, we cannot determine the exact contents of the list `digits`. Thus, the output state will indicate that `digits` is created based on the string representation of an integer within the range specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of digits derived from the string representation of `num`, where `num` is an integer in the range 1 to 3**.
