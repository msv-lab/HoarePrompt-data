The value of `found` is changed from `True` to `False`. The values of `digits` and `digit` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `digits` is a list of at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list.

Output State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a list of at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
