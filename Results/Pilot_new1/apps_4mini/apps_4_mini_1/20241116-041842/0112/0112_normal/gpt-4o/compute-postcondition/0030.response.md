Output State: **If `n` is between 1 and 3 and `digits` is a non-empty list, then after the loop executes, `used_cubes` will contain a combination of True and False values indicating which cubes have been used, and `found` will be True if all digits have corresponding cubes; otherwise, if any digit cannot be matched to a cube, the function returns False. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, or if `digits` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged as a list of False values, and `found` remains False.**
