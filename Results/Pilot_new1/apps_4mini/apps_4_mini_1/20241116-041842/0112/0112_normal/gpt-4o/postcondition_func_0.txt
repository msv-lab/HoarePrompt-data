The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` lists of 6 integers each (with each integer in the range 0 to 9). It returns an integer `x`, which represents the largest consecutive integer starting from 1 that can be formed using the cubes. The return value can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether the integers 1, 2, or 3 can be formed. If none can be formed, it returns 0.
