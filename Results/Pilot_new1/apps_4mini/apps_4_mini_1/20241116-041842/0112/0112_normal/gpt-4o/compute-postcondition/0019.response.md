Postcondition: ***`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, and `used_cubes` is a list of length 3 filled with Boolean values. If there exists an index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the execution breaks out of the most inner loop or if statement. If no such index exists, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `found` is not modified.***
