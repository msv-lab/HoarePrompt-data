According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate `n` times, starting from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 3`. 

If `n` is 2, the loop has already executed for `i = 0` and `i = 1`, and it cannot execute again. If `n` is 3, the loop has executed for `i = 0`, `i = 1`, and it can execute one more time for `i = 2`.

Since `digits` is a list of at least 1 digit and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is adjusted to allow for one more iteration. Therefore, if `n` is currently 2, it should be adjusted to 3 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length 3 filled with Boolean values**
