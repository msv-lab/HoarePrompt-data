Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with False, `found` is False, `i` is 0. The `i`-th element of `used_cubes` is still False, and the `digit` is present in the `i`-th element of `cube_faces`.***
