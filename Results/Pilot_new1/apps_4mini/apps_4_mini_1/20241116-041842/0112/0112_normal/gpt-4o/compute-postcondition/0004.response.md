According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0 before the first iteration of the loop, which is the typical starting index for a loop in Python. 

The state of `used_cubes` is relevant for tracking the usage of cubes throughout the loop iterations, but it does not affect the loop's ability to execute initially. The variable `found` is also not relevant for the loop's execution at the start.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state must include that `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length n filled with False, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
