According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one element. The `n` variable indicates the number of elements that can be used, but it does not directly affect the execution of the loop itself. The `used_cubes` list is not relevant to the execution of the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `digits` is not empty. Therefore, we need to specify that `digits` contains at least one digit.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length n filled with False**
