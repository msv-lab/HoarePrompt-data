The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched to a set of cubes defined by `cube_faces`. It returns `True` if all digits can be matched to the cubes and `False` if any digit cannot be matched or if the input parameters are invalid (specifically if `n` is not between 1 and 3 or if the list of digits is empty). However, the function does not validate the input parameters `n` and `cube_faces`, which could lead to unintended behavior if they are not set correctly.
