Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with Boolean values. If there exists an index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop is exited. If no such index exists, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` retains its previous value.***
