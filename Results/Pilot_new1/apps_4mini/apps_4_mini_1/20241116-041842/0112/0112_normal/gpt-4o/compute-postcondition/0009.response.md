Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with False. If the `i`-th element of `used_cubes` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the conditions are not met, `used_cubes` remains unchanged and `found` remains False.***
