The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` has one index set to True and the rest remain False, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
