The function accepts an integer input `n` which specifies the number of lists to read, and then reads `n` lists of integers from the input. It collects the unique digits from these lists, removes the digit '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. Finally, it prints this maximum integer. If `n` is 0, no lists are processed, and the output will be an empty result since no digits are collected.
