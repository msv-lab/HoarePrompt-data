According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` has at least 3 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 3 lists, and `cube` must be updated to be the third list in `cubes`. The `n` value does not need to be adjusted since it does not affect the loop execution in this context.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
