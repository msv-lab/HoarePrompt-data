According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` has more than 1 list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 2 lists, and `cube` should be the second list in the `cubes`. Additionally, `digits` would need to be updated with string representations of integers from this second `cube`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with string representations of integers from `cube`.**
