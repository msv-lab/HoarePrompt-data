The code initializes `digits` as an empty set. The previous values of `n` and `cubes` are unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on input; `digits` is an empty set**
