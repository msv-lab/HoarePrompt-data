Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. It then computes the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` for lemons,
   - `max_lemons * 2` for apples,
   - `max_lemons * 4` for pears.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If there are not enough pears (or apples) to match the required ratio, `max_lemons` will be zero, resulting in a total of 0 fruits, which is correct as per the problem description.
- The program also correctly handles the maximum limits of the input values (1 to 1000).

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem statement and produces the expected outputs for all potential cases, confirming its correctness.
