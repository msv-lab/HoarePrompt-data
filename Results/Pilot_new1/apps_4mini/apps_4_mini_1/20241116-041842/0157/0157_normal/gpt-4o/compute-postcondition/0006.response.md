The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraints that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, each ranging from 1 to 1000. Since there is no output provided in the description, we cannot determine what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined due to the lack of output information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is currently undefined due to lack of information.**
