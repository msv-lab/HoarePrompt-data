The variable `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
