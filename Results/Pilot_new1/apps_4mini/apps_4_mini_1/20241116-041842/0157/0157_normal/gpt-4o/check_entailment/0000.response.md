Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step by step.

**Problem Description:**
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons, apples, and pears. The ratio of fruits for making compote is 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears). The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote based on the available quantities.

**Program:**
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Understanding the Code:**
   - The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
   - It calculates `max_lemons` as the minimum of:
     - `a` (the number of lemons available)
     - `b // 2` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with available apples)
     - `c // 4` (the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with available pears)
   - It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.
   - Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

2. **Edge Cases to Consider:**
   - If `a`, `b`, or `c` are at their minimum values (1), we need to ensure the program handles these cases correctly.
   - If any of the fruits are insufficient to meet the ratio (for instance, if there are no pears), the program should return 0.

3. **Output Hints:**
   - The output hints state that the program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the input quantities and prints the total. 
   - The hints also mention that if there are not enough pears, the answer should be 0.

4. **Testing the Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`:
     - `max_lemons = min(1, 1//2, 1//4) = min(1, 0, 0) = 0`
     - The program should return 0, which is correct.
   - **Case 2:** If `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`:
     - `max_lemons = min(2, 3//2, 2//4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
     - The program should return 0, which is correct.
   - **Case 3:** If `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 13`:
     - `max_lemons = min(4, 7//2, 13//4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
     - The program should return `3 * 7 = 21`, which is correct.

**Conclusion:**
After reviewing the program against the problem description and considering edge cases, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used for compote based on the available quantities. The output hints also align with the program's behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
