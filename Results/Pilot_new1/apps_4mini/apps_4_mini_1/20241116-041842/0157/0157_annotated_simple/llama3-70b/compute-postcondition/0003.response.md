The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, which means they can hold any integer values. The calculation for `b // 2` and `c // 4` will depend on the specific input values for `b` and `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
