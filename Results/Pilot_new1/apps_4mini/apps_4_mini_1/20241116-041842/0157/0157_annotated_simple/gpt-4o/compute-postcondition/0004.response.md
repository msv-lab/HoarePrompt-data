To determine the output state, we first analyze the impact of the code on the variables. 

1. `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. We know `a` is a positive integer, `b` is an integer, and `c` is a new input integer.
2. The calculation for `total_fruits` is done using the formula: 
   \[
   total\_fruits = max\_lemons \times 1 + max\_lemons \times 2 + max\_lemons \times 4
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   total\_fruits = max\_lemons \times (1 + 2 + 4) = max\_lemons \times 7
   \]

Since `max_lemons` is dependent on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, we can express `total_fruits` in terms of `max_lemons`:

- `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, but they influence `max_lemons`. However, we do not need their specific values to determine the output state.

The output state will reflect the calculated value of `total_fruits` based on the defined variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a new input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7**
