The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not specify any output in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three positive integers representing the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000.**
