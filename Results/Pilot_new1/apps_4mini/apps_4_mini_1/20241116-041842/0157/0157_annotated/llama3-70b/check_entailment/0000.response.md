To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay needs to cook a compote using lemons, apples, and pears in a specific ratio: for every 1 lemon, he needs 2 apples and 4 pears. The goal is to find the maximum total number of fruits he can use while adhering to this ratio. If he cannot use any fruits, the output should be 0.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func()` takes three inputs representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). It computes the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed based on the given ratios:

1. **Calculating Minimum Sets**:
   - `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`: This line calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be made. It takes the minimum of:
     - The number of lemons available (`a`).
     - The number of apples divided by 2 (because each set requires 2 apples).
     - The number of pears divided by 4 (because each set requires 4 pears).

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The total number of fruits used is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`. This is correct since each complete set consists of 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears, totaling 7 fruits.

### Edge Cases:
- The code does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers or outside the specified range (1 to 1000). However, the problem description guarantees that the inputs will be valid positive integers within this range.
  
- The code correctly handles the scenario where Nikolay cannot use any fruits. If `min_lemon` is 0, the output will be 0, which aligns with the requirement that if no fruits can be used, the output should be 0.

### Example Cases:
1. **Input**: `2, 5, 7`
   - Calculation: `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
   - Output: `1 * 7 = 7` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `4, 7, 13`
   - Calculation: `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
   - Output: `3 * 7 = 21` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `2, 3, 2`
   - Calculation: `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use in the compote based on the provided ratios. It handles all specified cases correctly according to the problem description, including the case where no fruits can be used.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**
