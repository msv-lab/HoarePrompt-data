The value of `b` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input that is converted to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a positive integer input, `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer input, `b` is a positive integer input, `c` is a positive integer**
