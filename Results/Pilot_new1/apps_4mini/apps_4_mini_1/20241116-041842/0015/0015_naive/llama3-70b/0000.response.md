To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to determine if a number `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference `c`. The sequence can be represented as:
- s_1 = a
- s_2 = a + c
- s_3 = a + 2c
- ...
- s_i = a + (i-1)c

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that s_i = b.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Case when `c == 0`:**
   - If `c` is 0, the sequence does not change, meaning all elements are equal to `a`.
   - The program correctly checks if `a == b` to return "YES" or "NO".

2. **Case when `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` using the steps of size `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which ensures that the steps are in the correct direction (i.e., we are not stepping backwards).

### Checking for Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** If `a = 1`, `b = 7`, `c = 3`: The sequence is 1, 4, 7 → Output should be "YES".
- **Case 2:** If `a = 10`, `b = 10`, `c = 0`: The sequence is constant at 10 → Output should be "YES".
- **Case 3:** If `a = 1`, `b = -4`, `c = 5`: The sequence is 1, 6, 11, ... → Output should be "NO".
- **Case 4:** If `a = 0`, `b = 60`, `c = 50`: The sequence is 0, 50, 100, ... → Output should be "NO".

### Potential Missing Cases:
Now let's consider a case where the checks do not cover all scenarios:
- **Case 5:** If `a = 5`, `b = 5`, `c = -1`: The sequence is 5, 4, 3, ... (decreasing). The program will output "YES" because `(5 - 5) % -1 == 0` and `(5 - 5) / -1 >= 0` is false, hence it will output "NO". However, `b` is indeed present in the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle cases where `c` is negative but `a` equals `b`. 

Correctness: **False**.
