Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This covers all scenarios including when `b - a` is negative, zero, or positive, ensuring that both divisibility and the sign of the difference are considered.***
