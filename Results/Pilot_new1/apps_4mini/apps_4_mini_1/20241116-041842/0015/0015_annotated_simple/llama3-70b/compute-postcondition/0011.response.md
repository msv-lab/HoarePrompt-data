The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0, and the program prints 'NO'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0, and the program prints 'NO'**
