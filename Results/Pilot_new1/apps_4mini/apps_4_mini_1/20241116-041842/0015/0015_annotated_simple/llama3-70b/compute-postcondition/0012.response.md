Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with `c` not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if either condition fails, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is negative or not divisible by `c`, ensuring all edge cases regarding the divisibility and sign of the difference are handled.***
