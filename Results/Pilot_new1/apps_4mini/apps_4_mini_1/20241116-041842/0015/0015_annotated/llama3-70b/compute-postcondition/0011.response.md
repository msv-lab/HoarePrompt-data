The code prints 'NO', which indicates that the condition specified in the initial state has been met. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement executed and the values of the variables remain as initially given.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input, the value of `c` is not equal to 0, and either (b - a) % c is not equal to 0 or (b - a) / c is less than 0; 'NO' is printed.**
