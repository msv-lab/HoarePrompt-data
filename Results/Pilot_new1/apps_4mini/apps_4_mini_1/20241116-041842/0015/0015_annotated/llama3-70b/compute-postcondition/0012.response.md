Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input, with `c` not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, 'NO' is printed.***
