To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program needs to determine if a number `b` appears in an infinite arithmetic sequence that starts with `a` and has a common difference of `c`. The sequence is defined as:
- `s_1 = a`
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for `i >= 1`

The output should be "YES" if `b` appears in the sequence and "NO" otherwise.

### Code Analysis:
1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence does not change; it remains constant at `a`. 
   - If `a == b`, the output is "YES".
   - If `a != b`, the output is "NO".
   - This part correctly handles the case where the sequence is constant.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If `(b - a) % c == 0`: This checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` a certain number of times (i.e., `b` must lie on the sequence).
     2. If `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This ensures that the number of steps to reach `b` from `a` is non-negative (i.e., we can only move forward in the sequence).
   - If both conditions are met, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

### Example Cases:
- For input `1 7 3`: 
  - The sequence is `1, 4, 7, ...` and `7` is in the sequence. The output is "YES".
  
- For input `10 10 0`: 
  - The sequence is constant at `10`. Since `b` equals `a`, the output is "YES".
  
- For input `1 -4 5`: 
  - The sequence is `1, 6, 11, ...` and `-4` is not in the sequence. The output is "NO".
  
- For input `0 60 50`: 
  - The sequence is `0, 50, 100, ...` and `60` is not in the sequence. The output is "NO".

### Edge Cases:
The program seems to correctly handle the edge cases described in the problem statement and the examples provided. 

### Conclusion:
The code effectively checks all necessary conditions to determine if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`. The annotations in the code accurately reflect the logic and edge cases being handled.

Since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
