The code prints 'NO', and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input, `c` is 0, `a` is not equal to `b`, and 'NO' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input, `c` is 0, `a` is not equal to `b`, and 'NO' is printed**
