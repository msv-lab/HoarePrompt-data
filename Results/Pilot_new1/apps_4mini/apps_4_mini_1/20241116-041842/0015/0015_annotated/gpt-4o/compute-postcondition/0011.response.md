Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with `c` not equal to 0 and `b` not equal to `a`. If `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, which occurs if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or if `(b - a) / c` is negative.***
