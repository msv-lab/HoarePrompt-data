The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variable. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, the value of `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is equal to 0, and the output is 'NO'**
