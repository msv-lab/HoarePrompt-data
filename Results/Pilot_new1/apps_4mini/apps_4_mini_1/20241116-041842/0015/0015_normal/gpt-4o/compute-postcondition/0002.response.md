The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and includes the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9; the printed output is 'YES'**
