To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the output hints, let's break down the analysis step by step.

### Problem Description
The problem requires us to determine if a number `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The difference between consecutive elements is `c`.

The sequence can be defined as:
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for positive integers `i`.

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Program Analysis
The program does the following:
1. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If yes, it prints "YES".
2. If `b` is not equal to `a`, it checks if `c` is zero. If `c` is zero, it prints "NO" because the sequence would consist of the single element `a`.
3. If `c` is not zero, it checks if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. If both conditions are true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases
Now, let's consider potential edge cases:
1. **When `c = 0` and `a != b`:** The program correctly returns "NO" since the sequence does not change and does not include `b`.
2. **When `c > 0`:** We need to ensure that if `b` is less than `a`, the program returns "NO". The program does this by checking `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
3. **When `c < 0`:** The program should also handle the case where `b` is greater than `a`. If `c` is negative, the sequence decreases, and if `b` is greater than `a`, it should return "NO". The program does this with the condition `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which will be false in this case.

### Output Hints
The output hints summarize the program's functionality and confirm that it checks the necessary conditions. They align with the code's logic and provide clarity on how the program operates.

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases as per the problem description. It accurately determines whether `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
