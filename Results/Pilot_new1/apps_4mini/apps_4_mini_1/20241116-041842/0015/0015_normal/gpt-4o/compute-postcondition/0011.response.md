Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, where `c` is not equal to 0 and `b` is not equal to `a`. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or the quotient is negative, the program prints 'NO'.***
