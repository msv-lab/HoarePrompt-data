The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this operation, and since the initial condition states that `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output remains consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has been executed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; the print statement outputs 'NO'**
