Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula provided in the loop for `i` ranging from 1 to `k - 1`. If `k` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `dp[n, k]` remains 9. If `k` is exactly 2, the loop executes once, resulting in `dp[n, k]` being updated to 9 * 10. If `k` is greater than 2, the loop executes `k - 1` times, and `dp[n, k]` is updated accordingly for each iteration. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged and satisfy 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `n` remains an integer that is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
