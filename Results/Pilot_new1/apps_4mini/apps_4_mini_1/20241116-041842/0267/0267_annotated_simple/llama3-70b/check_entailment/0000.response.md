To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and its logic.

The problem requires calculating the sum of all integers between `l` and `r` that contain at most `k` different digits. The program is structured into two functions: `func_1` and `count`.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function initializes a dictionary `dp` to store previously computed results and calls the `count` function for both `r` and `l - 1`. It calculates the difference of these two counts and returns the result modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - The function checks if `k` is zero; if so, it returns 0 (which is correct since no numbers can have 0 different digits).
   - It checks if the result for `(n, k)` is already computed and stored in `dp`. If so, it returns that value.
   - If `n` is less than `10^k`, it assigns `n` to `dp[n, k]`, which seems to indicate that all numbers from 0 to `n` can be formed with at most `k` digits.
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`, it performs a calculation to determine the number of valid numbers with at most `k` different digits and updates `dp[n, k]` accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
- The main concern arises from the logic in the `count` function. Specifically, when `n` is less than `10^k`, the function assigns `n` to `dp[n, k]`. This may not correctly account for all numbers between `l` and `r` that meet the digit condition.
- The program does not explicitly sum the valid numbers between `l` and `r` that meet the criteria. Instead, it relies on the counting mechanism, which may not correctly capture the sum of those numbers.
- For example, consider the case where `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 1`. The only valid numbers are `11`, `22`, `33`, and `44`. However, if `count` does not correctly account for the numbers formed by only one digit, it will not return the correct sum.

### Conclusion:
Given the concerns about how the program calculates the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits, I can identify cases where it may not return the expected results based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly handle the sum of valid numbers, particularly in cases where `l` and `r` span a range that includes numbers with differing digit counts that should be included or excluded based on the value of `k`.
