According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` should be incremented to `l + 1`, and it should still be within the bounds defined by `r`. Since `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and both are less than \(10^{18}\), `num` can be adjusted to `l + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted because `total_sum` remains unchanged if `func_1(num, k)` returns false, and the values of `k`, `l`, and `r` do not change for the next iteration.

State: **`l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l + 1`**
