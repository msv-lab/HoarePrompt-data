Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `k` are integers such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0 initially, and `num` is equal to `l + 2`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns True, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, which implies `total_sum` will be equal to `(num) % MOD` since it starts at 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns False, `total_sum` remains 0.***
