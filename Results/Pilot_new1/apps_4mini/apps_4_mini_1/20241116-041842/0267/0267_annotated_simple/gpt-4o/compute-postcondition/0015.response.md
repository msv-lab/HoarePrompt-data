Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `l` and `r`, and another parameter `k`. It calculates the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. If `l` equals `r` and `func_1(l, k)` returns false, it also returns 0. The function does not handle the case where `MOD` is not defined or is zero, which could lead to a division by zero error in some implementations.**
