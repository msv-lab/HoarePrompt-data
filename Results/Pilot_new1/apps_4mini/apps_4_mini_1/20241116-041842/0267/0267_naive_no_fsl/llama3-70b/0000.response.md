To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it adheres to the requirements.

### Problem Requirements Recap
1. Given two integers `l` and `r`, we need to calculate the sum of all integers in the range `[l, r]` that contain at most `k` different digits.
2. The result should be given modulo `998244353`.

### Analysis of the Provided Code
1. The function `count(n, k, dp)` is designed to count the numbers with at most `k` different digits up to `n`.
2. The logic checks various conditions based on the number of digits and how many different digits can be used.
3. The program uses memoization (`dp` dictionary) to store results for previously computed values of `n` and `k`.
4. Finally, it calculates the sum of valid numbers in the range by subtracting the count of valid numbers less than `l` from the count of valid numbers less than or equal to `r`.

### Potential Issues
- The function `count(n, k, dp)` does not explicitly generate the numbers and check if they contain at most `k` different digits. Instead, it uses a mathematical approach to estimate the count, which may not accurately reflect the actual sum of the numbers that meet the criteria.
- The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where `l` and `r` are very close or where `k` is small. For example, if `k = 1`, it should only consider numbers like `1, 2, 3...`, and it should be careful with ranges that include numbers that don't fit the `k` different digits criteria.

### Example Test Case
Let's consider a simple test case:
- Input: `l = 1`, `r = 10`, `k = 1`
- Expected output: The valid numbers are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, and `10` (but only `1` to `9` should be included since `10` has two different digits). The expected sum is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45`.

However, the logic in the program might not correctly handle this case because it does not explicitly check the digit composition of each number.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis and the potential issues identified, particularly with how the program estimates counts without explicitly verifying the digit constraints, we conclude that the program does not guarantee correctness for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
