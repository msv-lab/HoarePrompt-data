To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it accurately implements the requirements of the problem description. 

The problem requires calculating the sum of numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) that contain at most \( k \) different digits. The program defines a function `func_1` that uses a helper function `count` to compute the count of valid numbers up to a given number \( n \) with at most \( k \) different digits. It then calculates the sum of valid numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) using the difference of counts.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where \( k \) is very small (like 1) and the range \( [l, r] \) contains numbers with more than one digit. For instance, if \( l = 10 \), \( r = 20 \), and \( k = 1 \), the valid numbers would be \( 11 \) (only one number qualifies), but the program might not sum this correctly depending on how `count` is implemented.
  
2. **Digit Count Logic**: The logic in `count` for calculating the valid numbers might not correctly account for all scenarios where numbers contain different digits, especially when transitioning from numbers like \( 99 \) to \( 100 \) or similar cases where the digit count changes.

3. **Modulo Handling**: The program uses modulo \( 998244353 \) for the results. If the calculation of sums is incorrect before applying the modulo, the output will also be incorrect.

4. **Boundary Cases**: There may be issues with how numbers at the boundary of \( l \) and \( r \) are handled. For example, if \( l = 1 \), \( r = 10 \), and \( k = 2 \), the program needs to ensure all valid numbers are included.

### Example Case to Illustrate Failure:
Consider the case where \( l = 10 \), \( r = 20 \), and \( k = 1 \). The only valid number in this range is \( 11 \) (since it is the only number formed with a single digit '1'). The expected output should be \( 11 \). However, if the implementation of `count` does not correctly identify that only \( 11 \) is valid, it may return an incorrect sum.

Given these potential pitfalls and the lack of clarity in how the program handles various edge cases, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description comprehensively.

Correctness: **False**.
