The code updates the value of `total_sum` by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. However, the values of `num` and `MOD` are not provided, and since `total_sum` remains unchanged in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific new value for it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `total_sum` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10^18, `r` is equal to `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` remains unchanged**.
