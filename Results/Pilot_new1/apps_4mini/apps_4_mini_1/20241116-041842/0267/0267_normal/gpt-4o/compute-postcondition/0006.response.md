The code updates `total_sum` by adding `num` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `total_sum` are not directly provided, but we know that `r` is equal to `l`, and `total_sum` is initialized based on the condition of `func_1(l, k)`. Since `func_1(l, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is equal to `l` modulo `MOD`. 

Assuming `num` is a variable that has been defined earlier in the code, the new value of `total_sum` will be calculated as follows:

- The previous value of `total_sum` is `l % MOD`.
- The new value of `total_sum` will be `(l % MOD + num) % MOD`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `total_sum`, while `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is equal to `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is updated to (l % MOD + num) % MOD**.
