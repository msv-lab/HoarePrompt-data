According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l < 10^{18}\), and `r` is equal to `l + 1`. This means that the last value of `num` in the previous iteration was `r`, which is equal to `l + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r + 1`. Since `r` is currently `l + 1`, the next value of `num` would be `r + 1`, which is equal to `l + 2`.

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted so that `r` becomes `l + 1` and `num` can take the value of `l + 2`. Therefore, `r` should be adjusted to `l + 2`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10^18, `r` is equal to `l + 2`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10.**
