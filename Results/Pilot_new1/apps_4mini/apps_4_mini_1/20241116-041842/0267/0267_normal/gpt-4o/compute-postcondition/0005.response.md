According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l` modulo `MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` returns true. Given that `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `r` is also an integer within the same bounds, we need to adjust the states to ensure that the loop can execute one more time.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `r`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented to `r + 1`. However, since the loop's range is defined from `l` to `r`, and `r + 1` exceeds this range, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, to make it possible for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `r` to be equal to `l` (or greater than `l`, but still less than or equal to 10^18) and ensure that `num` is set to `l` (or the next valid number in the range). 

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `r`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is equal to `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is equal to `l` modulo `MOD` if `func_1(l, k)` returns true**
