According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `num` is within the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop iterates from `l` to `r`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `l` is an integer such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\) and that `r` is equal to `l`. This means the loop has already executed for `num = l`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be increased to allow `num` to take on the next value. Since `r` is currently equal to `l`, we need to adjust `r` to be `l + 1` to allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `r` is now greater than `l`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < 10^18, `r` is equal to `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` remains unchanged.**
