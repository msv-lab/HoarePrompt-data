The function accepts an integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns True if the number of distinct digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `n` is negative or when `k` is less than 0, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
