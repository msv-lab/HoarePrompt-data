Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is equal to `num` (which is `l`) modulo `MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` returns true. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0.***
