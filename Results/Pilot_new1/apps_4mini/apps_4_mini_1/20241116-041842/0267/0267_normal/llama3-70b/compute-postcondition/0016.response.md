According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k` (since the loop runs from 1 to `k-1`), meaning it can execute again.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` will become the next integer, which is `i + 1`.

Since the loop runs from 1 to `k-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must remain unchanged. Thus, we only need to adjust `i`.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with the additional calculation based on `i + 1` and `k`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `k` remains the same**
