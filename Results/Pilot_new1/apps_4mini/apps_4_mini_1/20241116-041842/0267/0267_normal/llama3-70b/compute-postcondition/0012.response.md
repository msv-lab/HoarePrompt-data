According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `k` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, since `i` will be compared to `k` in the next iteration.

Thus, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 2. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `9 + 9 * (10^{(k - 1)} - 1)`; `i` is 2; `k` is greater than 2**
