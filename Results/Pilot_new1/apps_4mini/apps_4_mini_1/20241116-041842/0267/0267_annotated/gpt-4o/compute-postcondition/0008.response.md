According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, and `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Since the last iteration would have processed `num` equal to `r`, for the loop to execute again, `r` must be adjusted to be greater than `r` (i.e., `r` must be increased). Additionally, `num` will then be set to `l` for the next iteration.

Thus, the adjusted states should reflect that `r` is now greater than the previous value of `r`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18 and greater than the previous `r`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is initially 0, and `num` is `l`.**
