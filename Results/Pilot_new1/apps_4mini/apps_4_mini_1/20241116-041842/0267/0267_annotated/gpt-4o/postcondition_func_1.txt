The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of all integers between `l` and `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. If no integers in the range satisfy this condition, the function returns 0. Additionally, if `l` is greater than `r`, the sum will also be 0 since there are no integers in the range.
