According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates from `l` to `r`, inclusive. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` are already constrained by the conditions `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, we can assume that these conditions are satisfied.

At the start of the loop, `num` will take the value of `l`, which is the first number in the range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is initialized correctly as the loop begins.

The current state before the loop starts is:
- `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18
- `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10
- `total_sum` is 0

For the loop to execute, we need to specify that `num` is initialized to `l`. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
