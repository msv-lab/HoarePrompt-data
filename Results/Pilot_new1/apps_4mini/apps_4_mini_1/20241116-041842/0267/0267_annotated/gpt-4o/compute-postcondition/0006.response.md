The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to the current value of `total_sum` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. However, the values of `num` and `MOD` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `total_sum` after this operation. The other variables (`l`, `r`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`**
