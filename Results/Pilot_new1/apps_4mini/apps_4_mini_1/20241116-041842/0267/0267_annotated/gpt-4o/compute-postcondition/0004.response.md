Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true for `num` equal to `l`, then `total_sum` is updated to `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0.***
