The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. Given that `k` is 2 and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop, we can calculate the expression step by step:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`: 
   - `i` is 1, so `10 ** (i - 1)` equals `10 ** 0`, which is 1.

2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`:
   - `k` is 2 and `i` is 1, so `10 ** (k - i)` equals `10 ** (2 - 1)`, which is `10 ** 1`, or 10.

3. Now, calculate the full expression:
   - `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` equals `10 - 1`, which is 9.
   - Therefore, `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` equals `9 * 1 * 9`, which is 81.

4. Finally, update `dp[n, k]`:
   - The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9. After adding 81, the new value of `dp[n, k]` becomes `9 + 81`, which is 90.

The other variables `l`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 90, and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.**
