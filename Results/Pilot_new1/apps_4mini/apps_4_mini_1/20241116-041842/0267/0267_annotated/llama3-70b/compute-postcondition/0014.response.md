According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `k`. The loop is set to iterate over the range from 1 to `k` (not inclusive). Given that `k` is 2, the valid values for `i` in this loop are 1 and 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which is not a valid value for the next iteration of the loop since the loop will not execute for `i` equal to or greater than `k`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `k`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 1. Since `k` is still 2, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is -720, `i` is 1**
