To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we first analyze the given initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18
- `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18
- `k` is 2
- `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`
- `dp[n, k]` is 90
- `i` is 2

Now, we look at the code:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
```

1. Calculate `i - 1`: 
   - Since `i` is 2, `i - 1` equals 1.

2. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`:
   - `10 ** 1` equals 10.

3. Calculate `k - i`:
   - Since `k` is 2 and `i` is 2, `k - i` equals 0.

4. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`:
   - `10 ** 0` equals 1.

5. Now compute the expression inside the parentheses:
   - `10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)` equals `1 - 10`, which equals `-9`.

6. Now substitute back into the equation:
   - `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 * (-9)`.

7. Calculate `9 * 10 * (-9)`:
   - This equals `-810`.

8. Finally, update `dp[n, k]`:
   - Initially, `dp[n, k]` is 90, so `90 + (-810)` equals `-720`.

Thus, after executing the code, the state of the affected variable `dp[n, k]` changes from 90 to -720, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is -720, `i` is 2**
