According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string. Since `n` is a positive integer, it implies that there is at least one character in the `fractions` string. Therefore, we need to ensure that `fractions` is a non-empty string. 

At the start of the loop, `fraction` should be set to the first character of the `fractions` string. The initial values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they are part of the program state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in `fractions`**
