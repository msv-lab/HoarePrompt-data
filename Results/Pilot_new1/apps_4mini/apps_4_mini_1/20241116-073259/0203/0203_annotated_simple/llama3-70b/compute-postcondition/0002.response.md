The variable `depublicans` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of `n` and `fractions` is unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0**
