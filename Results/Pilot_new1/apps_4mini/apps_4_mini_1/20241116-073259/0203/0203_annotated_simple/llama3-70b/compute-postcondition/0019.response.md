Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D'. If `fractions` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the length of `fractions` if it is non-empty.**
