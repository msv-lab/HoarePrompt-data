Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, and `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D'. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the function prints 'D'. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the function prints 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and the output is 'R'. The value of `n` represents the length of `fractions` and is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) if `fractions` is non-empty.***
