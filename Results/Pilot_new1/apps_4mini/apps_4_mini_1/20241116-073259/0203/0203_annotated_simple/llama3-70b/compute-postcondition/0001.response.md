The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which means it will take a user input as a string. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` is an input string**
