Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` = 1 and `remocrats` = 0). If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` = 0 and `remocrats` = 1).***
