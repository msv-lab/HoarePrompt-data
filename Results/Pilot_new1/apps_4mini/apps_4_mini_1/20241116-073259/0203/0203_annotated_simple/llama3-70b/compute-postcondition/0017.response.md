Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `fractions` is a non-empty string. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `fraction` is any character other than 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1. This accounts for all possible values of `fraction`, ensuring that at least one of `depublicans` or `remocrats` is incremented based on the input.***
