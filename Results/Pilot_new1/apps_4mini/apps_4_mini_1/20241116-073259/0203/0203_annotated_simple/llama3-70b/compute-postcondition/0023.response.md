Output State: **`depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and if `fractions` is non-empty, then `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the length of `fractions`. If `fractions` is an empty string, then both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are 0; and the output is 'R'.**
