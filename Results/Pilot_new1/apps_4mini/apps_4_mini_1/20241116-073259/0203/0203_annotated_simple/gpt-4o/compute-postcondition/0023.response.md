The value of `d_index` is used to update `d_queue` by appending `d_index + n`. The previous state indicates that `d_queue` has been updated by removing the first element, and `r_queue` remains unchanged. The assignment of `r_index` to the first element of `r_queue` does not affect the current operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue` and the unchanged state of `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is updated by appending `d_index + n`, `r_queue` remains unchanged, `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`**.
