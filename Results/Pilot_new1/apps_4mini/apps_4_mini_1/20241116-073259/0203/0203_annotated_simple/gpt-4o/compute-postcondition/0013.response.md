Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; if `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the index 0 and `n`, while `r_queue` remains empty; otherwise, `d_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is 'D', and `r_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is not 'D', with `r_queue` now containing `n`. In both cases, `i` is equal to `n`, and `v` is undefined.***
