The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, and since `d_queue` is non-empty, it can accept new elements. The value of `n` is not specified but is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `d_queue` after the append operation. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has an element `d_index + n` appended to it; `r_queue` is non-empty after removing its first element; `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`.**
