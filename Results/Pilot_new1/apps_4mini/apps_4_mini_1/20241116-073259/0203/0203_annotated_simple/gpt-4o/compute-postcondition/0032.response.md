Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is non-empty after appending either `d_index + n` if `d_index < r_index`, or `r_queue` is non-empty after appending `r_index + n` if `d_index >= r_index`. In both cases, `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the operation.***
