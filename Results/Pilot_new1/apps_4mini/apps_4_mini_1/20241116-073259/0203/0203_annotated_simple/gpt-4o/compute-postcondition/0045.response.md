Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed, and `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty. If `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed, and both queues remain unchanged. If `votes` is empty, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are also empty; otherwise, at least one of the queues remains unchanged and non-empty.***
