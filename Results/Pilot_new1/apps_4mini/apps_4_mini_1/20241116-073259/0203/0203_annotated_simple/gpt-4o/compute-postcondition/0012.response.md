The code appends the value of `i` to `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The previous values of `r_queue` are either empty or contain the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is not 'D'. 

After executing the code, `r_queue` will now include the value of `i`, which is equal to `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is 'D', otherwise `d_queue` is empty; `r_queue` contains the index 0 if the first character of `votes` is not 'D', otherwise `r_queue` is empty, and now `r_queue` contains `n`; `i` is equal to `n`, `v` is undefined**
