Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is a non-empty queue, `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty. The loop may have executed, resulting in `d_queue` and `r_queue` containing elements based on the comparisons of the indices popped from each queue. If the loop executed, `d_index` is the last popped element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the last popped element from `r_queue`. If the loop did not execute, both queues remain unchanged.***
