The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the `r_queue`. The `r_queue` is initially an empty list, so after the execution of the code, `r_queue` will contain one element, which is 0. The values of `n`, `votes`, `d_queue`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is [0], `i` is 0**
