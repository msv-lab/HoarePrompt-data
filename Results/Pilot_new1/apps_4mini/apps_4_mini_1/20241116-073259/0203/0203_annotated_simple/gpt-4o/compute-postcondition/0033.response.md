According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`. The loop will execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `d_queue` is non-empty after appending either `d_index + n` if `d_index < r_index`, or `r_queue` is non-empty after appending `r_index + n` if `d_index >= r_index`. This implies that both queues contain elements.

Since both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` is non-empty**
