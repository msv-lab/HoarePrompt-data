The code initializes `r_queue` as an empty list. The values of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string with whitespace removed; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the user input string with whitespace removed; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
