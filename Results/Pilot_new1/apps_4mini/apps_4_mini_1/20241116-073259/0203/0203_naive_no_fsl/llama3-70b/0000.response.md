Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the voting procedure described in the problem statement. It simply counts the number of employees from each fraction (depublicans and remocrats) and declares the winner based on which group has more members. However, the problem description specifies a complex voting mechanism where employees can deny others the right to vote in a sequential manner, and the outcome depends on the strategic actions taken by the employees during the voting process.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
DRDRD
```

In this case, the employees would take turns denying each other the right to vote. The first employee (D) can deny the second (R), and the process continues. The actual outcome of the vote cannot be determined by simply counting the number of employees in each fraction; it requires simulating the voting process as described.

Thus, the program fails to account for the dynamics of the voting process, leading to incorrect predictions in many scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
