Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 while `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1, which can result in either 1 or 2 depending on its initial value.***
