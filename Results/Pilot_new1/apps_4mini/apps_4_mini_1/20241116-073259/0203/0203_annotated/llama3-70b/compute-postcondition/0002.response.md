The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The initial state mentions that `n` is an input integer and `fractions` is a string of length `n`, but these variables are not affected by the code provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0**
