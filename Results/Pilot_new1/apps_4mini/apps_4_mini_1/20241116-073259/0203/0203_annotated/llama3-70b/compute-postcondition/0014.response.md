According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will iterate over each character in the `fractions` string, and since `n` is greater than 1, there are at least two characters in the string. 

At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character to be processed needs to be the third character of the `fractions` string. 

Thus, the following states need to be adjusted:
- The `fraction` should now be the third character of the `fractions` string.
- The `n` remains the same as it still represents the total length of the string.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n`, and `fraction` is the third character of `fractions`**
