The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The previous state indicates that `d_index` holds the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, and `n` is an additional value that is not specified but will be added to `d_index`. The state of `d_queue` changes as one new element is added, while `d_index` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `d_queue` with the new element.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (d_index + n), `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
