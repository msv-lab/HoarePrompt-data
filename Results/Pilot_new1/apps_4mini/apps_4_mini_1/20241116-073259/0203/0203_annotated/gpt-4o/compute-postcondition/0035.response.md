The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` has at least one element, this operation is valid and will result in `r_index` being assigned the value of that first element. The state of `r_queue` will be altered, reducing its length by one element. The values of `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_queue` now has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_queue` now has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
