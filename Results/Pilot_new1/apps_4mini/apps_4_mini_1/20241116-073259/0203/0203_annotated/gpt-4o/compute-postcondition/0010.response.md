According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `votes` string and the current index `i`. The loop iterates over the `votes` string using `enumerate`, which means it will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `votes`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the index `i` is at the current position in the string `votes`. Since `votes` is non-empty, it has at least one character, and `n` can be used to determine the total length of `votes`. 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the loop must check that `i` is still less than the length of `votes`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to the length of `votes` in order for the loop to stop executing. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to continue to the next character in `votes`.
- The character `v` should be the next character in `votes` at index `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`, `v` is the character at index `i` in `votes` (if it exists)**.
