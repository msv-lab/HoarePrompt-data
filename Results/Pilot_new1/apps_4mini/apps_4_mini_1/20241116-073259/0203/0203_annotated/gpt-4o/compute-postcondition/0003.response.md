The variable `r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `n` and `votes` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the input string with whitespace stripped; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is the input string with whitespace stripped; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
