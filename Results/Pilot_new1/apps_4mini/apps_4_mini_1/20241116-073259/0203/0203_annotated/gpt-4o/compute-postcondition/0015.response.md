The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The value of `i` is 0, and the initial state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is 0; `v` is the first character of `votes`; `d_queue` has `i` (0) appended to it.**
