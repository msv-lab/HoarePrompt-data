The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has at least one element, after this operation, `d_queue` will have one less element, and `d_index` will hold the value of the first element that was removed. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_queue` has at least one element**
