Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`. If the character `v` at index `i` in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` includes `i` as a new element. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` includes `i` as a new element. This ensures that the queues are updated based on the last character of `votes`, while `i` is always the length of `votes` and remains within the bounds of its definition.***
