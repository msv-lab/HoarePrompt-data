The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 0, and `r_queue` is an empty list at the beginning. After executing the code, `r_queue` will contain the value 0.

Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` contains the value 0; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` contains the value 0; `i` is 0**
