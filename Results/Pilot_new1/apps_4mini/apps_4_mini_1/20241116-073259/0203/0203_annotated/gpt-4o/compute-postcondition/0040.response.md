Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until at least one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, it indicates that all 'D' characters have been processed, and `r_queue` may still contain indices of non-'D' characters. Conversely, if `r_queue` is empty, it indicates that all non-'D' characters have been processed, and `d_queue` may still contain indices of 'D' characters. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.**
