The code prints the string 'R'. The values of the variables `d_queue`, `r_queue`, and `votes` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` is empty, `votes` is an empty string, and 'R' is printed to the output.

Output State: **`d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` is empty, `votes` is an empty string, and 'R' is printed to the output**.
