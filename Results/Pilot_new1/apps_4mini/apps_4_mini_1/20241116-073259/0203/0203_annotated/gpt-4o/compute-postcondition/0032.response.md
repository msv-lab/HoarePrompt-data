Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one less element, and if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has one additional element with the value `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` has one additional element with the value `r_index + n`. In both cases, `d_index` is the removed first element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`, which is not empty.***
