Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the value 2. Otherwise, `r_queue` contains the value 2. The state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` reflects the voting choice represented by the character `v`.***
