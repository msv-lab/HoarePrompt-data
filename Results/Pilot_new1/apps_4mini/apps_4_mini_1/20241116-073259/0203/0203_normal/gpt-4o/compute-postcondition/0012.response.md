The variable `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `r_queue` will contain the value 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character of `votes`; and `r_queue` now contains the value 1.
