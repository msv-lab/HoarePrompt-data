The `append` method adds the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The initial state indicates that `r_queue` has one less element, meaning it had at least one element before this operation. The value of `r_index` is given as the value of the removed element from `r_queue`, and `n` is an additional value that needs to be considered. 

Since `r_queue` has one less element, the new element will be added to it, which modifies its state. However, the specific values of `r_index` and `n` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value being appended.

Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `r_queue` while noting that the specific values are not defined.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least 1 element, `r_queue` has one more element (with the value of `r_index + n` appended), and `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.**
