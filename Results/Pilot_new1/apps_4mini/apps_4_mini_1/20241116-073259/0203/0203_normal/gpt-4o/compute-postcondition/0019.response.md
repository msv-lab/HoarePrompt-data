Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes, `r_queue` contains the indices of non-'D' votes, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.**
