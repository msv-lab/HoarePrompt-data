The code appends a new element to `r_queue`, which is calculated as `r_index + n`. The previous value of `r_index` is known, and `n` is an additional value that is assumed to be defined but is not specified in the initial state. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `r_queue`, which now contains one additional element.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one more element (the new element is `r_index + n`), and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
