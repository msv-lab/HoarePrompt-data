According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `votes` string. For the loop to execute at least once, the `votes` string must have at least one character. Since `n` is a positive integer, it indicates the length of the `votes` string. Thus, for the loop to execute, `votes` should not be an empty string, and `i` should start at 0, while `v` should be the first character in the `votes` string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty user input string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`**
