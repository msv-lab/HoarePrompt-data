The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `votes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the parameter `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent the fractions of the employees. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the counts of 'D' and 'R' in the `votes` string. 

Since the output specifics are not provided, I will summarize the functionality based on the accepted parameters:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string votes of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
