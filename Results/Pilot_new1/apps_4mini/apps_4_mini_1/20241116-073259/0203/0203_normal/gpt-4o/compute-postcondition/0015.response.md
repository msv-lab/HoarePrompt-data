The variable `d_queue` is being appended with the value of `i`, which is currently 2. The previous values of the affected variables are not impacted by this operation, and since `d_queue` is not defined in the initial state, we can assume it is an empty list before this operation. Therefore, after appending `i`, `d_queue` will contain the value 2. The output state reflects the values of the other variables and the current state of `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; `d_queue` is [2]**
