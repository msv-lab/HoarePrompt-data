The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has at least one element remaining, the operation is valid and will change the state of `d_queue` by removing its first element. The value of `d_index` will be the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_queue` has at least one element remaining**.
