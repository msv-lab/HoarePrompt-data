Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a non-empty user input string; `i` is 1; `v` is the second character of `votes`. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the value 1. Otherwise, if `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the value 1. This ensures that the program correctly categorizes the value of `i` based on the second character of `votes`.***
