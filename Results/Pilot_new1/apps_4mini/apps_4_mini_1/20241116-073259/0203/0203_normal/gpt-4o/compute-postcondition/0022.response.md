Postcondition: ***`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' votes with the first element removed, `r_queue` is updated (first element removed), `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty user input string, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and `d_index` is less than `r_index`.***
