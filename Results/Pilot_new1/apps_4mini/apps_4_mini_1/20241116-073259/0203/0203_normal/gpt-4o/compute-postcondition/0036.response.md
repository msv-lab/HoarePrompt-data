The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` originally had at least one element and now has one less, it implies that an element was removed from it before this operation. The specific value of `d_index` and `n` are not provided, but they will be used in the calculation.

The output state will reflect the change in `d_queue` due to the append operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (d_index + n is added), `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.**
