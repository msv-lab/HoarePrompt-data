The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'D'. This action does not modify the state of any variables, including `d_queue` and `r_queue`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of the queues along with the printed output.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty, `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty, and both queues remain unchanged; printed output is 'D'**.
