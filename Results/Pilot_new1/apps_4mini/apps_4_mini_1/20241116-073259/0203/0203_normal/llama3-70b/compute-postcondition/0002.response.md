The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not depend on any previous values of other variables, and it does not affect them either. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `depublicans`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0**
