The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000 - 1; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the next character in the string (if it exists); `depublicans` is increased by 1.
