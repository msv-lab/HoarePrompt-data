The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. After executing the function body, it does not explicitly state what the return value is. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `fractions` of length `n` made up of characters 'D' and 'R'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string fractions of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
