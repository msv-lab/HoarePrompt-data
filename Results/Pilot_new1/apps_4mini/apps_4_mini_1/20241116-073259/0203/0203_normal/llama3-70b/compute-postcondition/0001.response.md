The variable `fractions` is assigned the value from `input()`, which accepts a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The initial state of `n` is unaffected by this operation, and its value remains a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects that `fractions` now holds a string input, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
