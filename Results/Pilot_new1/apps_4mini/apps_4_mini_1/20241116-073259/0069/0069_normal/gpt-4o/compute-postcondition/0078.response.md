Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `0` is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is initialized to 0, and for each element `b` in `prefix_balances`, if `(x - b) % balance` equals 0 and `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, `count` is incremented. Finally, the value of `count` is appended to `results`. This covers all cases, including when `n` is 0 or lower, where `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.***
