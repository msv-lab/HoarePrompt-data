The code initializes `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The previous values of the affected variables do not change, and the state of the other variables remains the same. Therefore, the output state is `balance` is `count_0 - count_1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.

Output State: **`balance` is `count_0 - count_1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `results` has been appended with `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, and `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**
