The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is assigned the value of `int(data[0])`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list containing the split elements of the input string, and `index` is 1.
