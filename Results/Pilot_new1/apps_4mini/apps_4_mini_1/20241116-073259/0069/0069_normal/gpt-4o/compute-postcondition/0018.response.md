According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, which is determined by the previous iteration. Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. 

Given that `i` can take values from 1 to `n`, if `i` is currently at `n`, then for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted because the values of `prefix_balances[2]` and `prefix_balances[3]` do not affect the loop condition directly; they are part of the loop body processing.

State: **`prefix_balances[2]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[3]` is either 2 or 0 if `s[2]` is '0', or 0 or -2 if `s[2]` is '1'; `i` is `n + 1`**
