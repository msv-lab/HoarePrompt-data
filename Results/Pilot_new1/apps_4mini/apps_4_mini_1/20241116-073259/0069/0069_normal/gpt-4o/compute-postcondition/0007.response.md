The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `index` is given as 1, so `data[index + 1]` refers to `data[2]`. The value of `n` is already defined as `data[1]`, and since `data` has at least 1 element, `data[2]` exists. The value of `x` will be the integer conversion of `data[2]`. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `data` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `results` is an empty list**
