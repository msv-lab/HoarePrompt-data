The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified for `results`, but we know it will now contain one additional element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains cumulative values, `balance` is 0, `x`, `results` now includes 0, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged**.
