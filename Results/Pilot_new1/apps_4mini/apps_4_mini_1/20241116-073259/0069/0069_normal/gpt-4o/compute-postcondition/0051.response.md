According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since the loop runs from 1 to `n` (inclusive), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and there is no need to modify `prefix_balances` as it is already updated based on the value of `s[0]`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`; `i` is 2; `prefix_balances[1]` is updated based on the value of `s[0]`**
