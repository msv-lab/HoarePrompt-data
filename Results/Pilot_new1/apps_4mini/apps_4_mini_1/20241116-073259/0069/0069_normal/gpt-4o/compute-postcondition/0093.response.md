Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains cumulative values based on the characters in `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the net count of '0's and '1's from the first `i` characters of `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `i` will range from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`. The values of `balance`, `x`, `results`, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged in that case.**
