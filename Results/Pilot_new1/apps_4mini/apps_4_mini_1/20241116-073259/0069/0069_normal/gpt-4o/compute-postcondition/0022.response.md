The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The `prefix_balances` list, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element that exists within the `prefix_balances` list, and `results` now includes -1**.
