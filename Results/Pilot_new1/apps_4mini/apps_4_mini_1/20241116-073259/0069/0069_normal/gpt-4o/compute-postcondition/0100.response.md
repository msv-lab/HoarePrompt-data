Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains cumulative values based on the characters in `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the net count of '0's and '1's from the first `i` characters of `s`. `balance` is not equal to 0, `x`, `results`, `T`, `s`, and `index` remain unchanged. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, otherwise `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`.***
