The code appends the value `0` to the `results` list. The other variables, including `n`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new state of the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s` up to index `n`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` has a new entry of 0.**
