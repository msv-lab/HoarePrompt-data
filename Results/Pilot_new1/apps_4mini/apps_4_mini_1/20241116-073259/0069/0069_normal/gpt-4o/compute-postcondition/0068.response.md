Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is not empty, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is initialized to 0. If the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being at least 1. If the difference is negative or not a multiple of `balance`, `count` remains 0.***
