Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (for `1 <= i <= n`) represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to the `i`-th character of `s`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0. The variable `balance` is not equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, resulting in non-zero cumulative balances. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
