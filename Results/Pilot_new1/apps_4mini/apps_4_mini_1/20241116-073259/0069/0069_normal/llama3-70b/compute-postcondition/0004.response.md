The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, respectively. The initial values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this operation, and the specific counts depend on the content of the string `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is a positive integer (1 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`**
