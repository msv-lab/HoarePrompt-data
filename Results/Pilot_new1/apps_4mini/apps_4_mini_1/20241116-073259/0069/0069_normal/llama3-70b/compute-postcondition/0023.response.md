Postcondition: ***`n` is a new positive integer, `x` is a new integer, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `s` is an input string. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of complete cycles needed to adjust the balance. It is important to note that if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the division by zero would occur, which is a critical edge case that is not directly handled in the given code.
