The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged as this statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is a positive integer (1 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, and the function prints -1.**
