Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s` and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This covers cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a potential division by zero, or when `cnt0` and `cnt1` are both zero, which would also cause the same issue. In such cases, special handling might be necessary to avoid undefined behavior.***
