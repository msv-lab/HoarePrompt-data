The code executes a print statement that outputs the value of `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), the value of `n + 1` will be a positive integer in the range of 2 to 100001. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), and the printed output is `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), and the printed output is `n + 1`**
