Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` (the length of a binary string) and `x`, followed by a binary string `s` of length `n`. It counts the number of '0's and '1's in `s`, calculates their balance, and based on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, it prints different results. If `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If the counts of '0's and '1's are equal, it checks for a division by zero case. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `T` is 0, the function does not process any input and exits without output.**
