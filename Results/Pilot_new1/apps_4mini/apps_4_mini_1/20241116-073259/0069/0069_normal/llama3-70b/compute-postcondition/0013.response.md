Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is a positive integer (1 <= x <= 10^9), `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the integer division of `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` incremented by 1, which indicates how many adjustments are needed based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`. Edge cases include scenarios where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, which would lead to division by zero; however, since `balance` is not equal to `x`, it implies that `(x - balance)` cannot be zero when `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, thus avoiding this division by zero situation.***
