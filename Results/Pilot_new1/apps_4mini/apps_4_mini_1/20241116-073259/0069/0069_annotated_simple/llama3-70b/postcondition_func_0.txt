The function accepts a positive integer T, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n (the length of a binary string) and x (an integer), followed by a binary string s of length n. It counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in s, computes the balance as the difference between these counts, and then evaluates several conditions to determine what to print: if the balance equals x, it prints n + 1; if the counts of '0's and '1's are equal and balance does not equal x, it prints -1; if the balance does not equal x and the difference between x and balance is divisible by the difference between counts, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the result of the integer division of (x - balance) by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. If T is 0, the function does not execute any test cases.
