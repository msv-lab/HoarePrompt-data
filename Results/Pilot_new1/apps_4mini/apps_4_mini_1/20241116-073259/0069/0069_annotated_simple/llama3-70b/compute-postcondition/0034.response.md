Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the program should handle this case separately to avoid division by zero, ensuring that the output is correctly calculated based on the relationships between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`.***
