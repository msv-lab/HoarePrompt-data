The code counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the binary string `s`. The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the values of these counts. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the counts of '0's and '1's in the binary string.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`**
