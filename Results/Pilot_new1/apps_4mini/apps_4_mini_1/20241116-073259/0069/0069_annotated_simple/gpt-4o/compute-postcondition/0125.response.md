Output State: **If `results` contains at least one element, the loop will execute and print each element of `results`. If `results` is empty (which can occur if `T` is 0), the loop does not execute, and no values are printed. In this case, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is unchanged, and `results` is empty.**
