Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1`. If `balance` is equal to 0, and if `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; otherwise, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` hold true, and `results` contains the value of `count`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `results` empty. If `n` is 0 (though not applicable as per initial constraints), `prefix_balances` would remain a list of zeros of length `1` and results would not be updated.**
