Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each entry from `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`; `balance` is equal to 0, indicating that the count of '0's in `s` is equal to the count of '1's in `s`; `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`; `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than the current iteration count; if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop has executed, otherwise `prefix_balances` remains initialized to zeros.***
