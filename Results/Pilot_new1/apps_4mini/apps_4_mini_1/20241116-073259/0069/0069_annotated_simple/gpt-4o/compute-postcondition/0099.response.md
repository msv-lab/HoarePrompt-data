Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, and the final balance after processing all characters of `s` is 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1. If `x` is not an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes an additional entry of 0.***
