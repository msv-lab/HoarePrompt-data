According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If `results` contains at least 4 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list. To allow for another iteration, `results` must contain at least 4 elements, `result` should be the fourth element in the list, and the iteration index should be 4.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in the list**
