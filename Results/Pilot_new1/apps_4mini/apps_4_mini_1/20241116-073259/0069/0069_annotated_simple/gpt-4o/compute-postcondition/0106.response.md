According to the code, the loop iterates over each element `b` in the `prefix_balances` list. The loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the list to iterate over. 

At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`. To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the current index of the iteration. Since `b` is the first element, it suggests that there are still elements left to iterate over in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be the second element in the list, and the list should still contain at least 2 elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `b` is now the second element in the list.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is the second element of `prefix_balances`**
