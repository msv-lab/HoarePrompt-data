The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is increased by 1**
