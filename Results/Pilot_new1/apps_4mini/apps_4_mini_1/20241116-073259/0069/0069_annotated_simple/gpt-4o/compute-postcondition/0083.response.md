Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with each entry representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` contains -1 and an additional entry of 0, `count` is the number of entries in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `T` remains greater than the current iteration count, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])` and is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.**
