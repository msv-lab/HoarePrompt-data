Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, with `prefix_balances[i]` being the cumulative balance after processing the first `i` characters of `s`. If `s` contains '0', it adds 1 to the balance; otherwise, it subtracts 1. The loop executes exactly `n` times if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0 or less (which is not possible in this context as `n` is greater than or equal to 1), the loop would not execute and `prefix_balances` would remain as initialized with zeros.**
