The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into parts based on whitespace, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `data`. The initial values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. The variable `data` will hold the input values split into a list format.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'; `data` is a list of input values split by whitespace.**
