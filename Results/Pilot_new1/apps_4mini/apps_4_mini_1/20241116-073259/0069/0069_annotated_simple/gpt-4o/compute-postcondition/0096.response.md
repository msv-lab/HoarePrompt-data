The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The `prefix_balances` list remains unchanged, as it is not directly affected by this operation, and the state of `x` also remains as it is an element of `prefix_balances`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new entry in the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, the final balance after processing all characters of `s` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1.**
