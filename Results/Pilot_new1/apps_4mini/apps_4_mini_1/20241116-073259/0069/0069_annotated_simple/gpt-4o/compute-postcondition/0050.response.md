Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to zeros; `balance` is equal to the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`; `x` is `prefix_balances[1]`; `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than the current iteration count; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`; `index` is increased by 3; `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[1]` is updated based on the value of `s[0]`.**
