Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry from `prefix_balances[1]` to `prefix_balances[n]` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`; `balance` is not equal to 0; `x` is the last updated value in `prefix_balances`; `results` contains -1; `T` is greater than the current iteration count; if `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop executes, otherwise `prefix_balances` remains initialized to zeros; `count` is initialized to 0.**
