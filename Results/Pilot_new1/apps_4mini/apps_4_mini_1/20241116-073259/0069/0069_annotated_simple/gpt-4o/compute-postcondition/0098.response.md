The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state mentions that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, but it does not affect the `results` list. The final balance after processing all characters of `s` is `0`, but this does not change the state of the variables either. The only change is the addition of `0` to `results`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new addition to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each entry represents the cumulative balance based on the string `s`, the final balance after processing all characters of `s` is 0, `x` is not an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional entry of 0.**
