According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list contains at least one more element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains -1, which indicates that it has at least one element. For the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must contain at least two elements (including -1), and the next element in `results` should be accessible.

Since `results` contains -1, we can infer that it has at least one element, but we need to ensure that it has at least two elements for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `results` contains at least two elements.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` contains at least two elements, and the function prints -1**
