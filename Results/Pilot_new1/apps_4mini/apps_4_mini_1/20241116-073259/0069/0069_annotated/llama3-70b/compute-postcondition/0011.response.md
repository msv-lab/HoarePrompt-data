Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`; the difference `(x - balance)` is not divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, which means that `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not equal to 0 or `x - balance` is not equal to 0.***
