Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 99`; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of complete cycles needed to reach the balance. This takes into account cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to division by zero, and ensures that the output is appropriately handled based on the conditions of the inputs.***
