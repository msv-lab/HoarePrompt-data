Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`; `n` and `x` are input integers; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s'; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s'; `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1` and is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the output is the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for cases where `cnt0 - cnt1` is non-zero and ensures that the calculation does not lead to division by zero.***
