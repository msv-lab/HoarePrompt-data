The code assigns values to `n` and `x` by unpacking the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which takes input from the user, splits it into separate strings, converts those strings to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `x`. The values of `T` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100; `n` and `x` are input integers.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100; `n` and `x` are input integers**
