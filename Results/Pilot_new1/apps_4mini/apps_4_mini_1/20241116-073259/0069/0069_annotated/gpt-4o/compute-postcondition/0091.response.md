The code updates `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is added to either `1` or `-1`, depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is `'0'` or not. Since `i` is `n` and `n` is unchanged, we don't have to worry about any changes to `n`. 

The output state will reflect the new value of `prefix_balances[i]`, but without specific values for `prefix_balances[i - 1]` or `s[i - 1]`, we cannot provide exact numbers. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `s[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged**
