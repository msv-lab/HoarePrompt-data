Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is equal to 0, and the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i` is equal for all indices from 1 to `n`. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` has -1 appended to it. Otherwise, if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` has 0 appended to it.***
