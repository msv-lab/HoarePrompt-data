The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `s` will be assigned the value of `data[3]`. The previous values of the affected variables are not specified, but `data` must contain at least 4 elements for this assignment to be valid. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]**
