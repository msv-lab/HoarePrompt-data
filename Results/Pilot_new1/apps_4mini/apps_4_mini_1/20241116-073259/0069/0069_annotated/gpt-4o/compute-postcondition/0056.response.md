Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones in the string `s` up to index `i`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' in `s` up to the `i`-th character. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `prefix_balances` will be updated accordingly. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `1` filled with zeros.**
