The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but the state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is now an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.
