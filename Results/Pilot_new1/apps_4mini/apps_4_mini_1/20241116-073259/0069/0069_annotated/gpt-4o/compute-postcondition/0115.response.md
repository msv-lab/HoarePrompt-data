Postcondition: ***If `balance` is equal to 0, and if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` has -1 appended to it; otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. In cases where `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros of length `n + 1`, and the loop does not execute.***
