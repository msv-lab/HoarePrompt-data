According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` iterable. If `results` has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 items. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must have at least 3 items, and the `result` should refer to the third item in the iterable.

State: **`results` is an iterable with at least 3 items, result is the third item in the iterable**
