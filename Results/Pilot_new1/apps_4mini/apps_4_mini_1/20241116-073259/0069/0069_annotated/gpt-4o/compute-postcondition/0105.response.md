Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances` (which is 0). If the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being at least 1. If the condition is not satisfied, `count` remains 0.***
