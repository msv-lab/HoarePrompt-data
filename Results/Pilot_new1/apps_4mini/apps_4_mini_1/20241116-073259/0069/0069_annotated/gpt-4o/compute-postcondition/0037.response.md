Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that there is a valid combination of `x` and `b` based on the given conditions. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
