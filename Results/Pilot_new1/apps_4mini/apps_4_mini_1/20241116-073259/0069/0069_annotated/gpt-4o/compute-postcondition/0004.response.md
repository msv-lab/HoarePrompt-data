The code initializes an empty list `results`. The previous values of the affected variables `T`, `n`, `x`, and `index` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of these variables along with the new empty list.

Output State: **`T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list**.
