Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This ensures that `count` is only incremented when the conditions regarding `x`, `b`, and `balance` are satisfied, accounting for the potential cases where `(x - b)` is either a multiple of `balance` or non-negative.***
