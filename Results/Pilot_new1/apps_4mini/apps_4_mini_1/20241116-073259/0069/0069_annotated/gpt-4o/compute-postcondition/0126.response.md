The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer, constrained between 1 and 100.
- `n` is a positive integer, constrained between 1 and 100,000.
- `x` is an integer, constrained between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The function's output is not explicitly stated, but it is implied that it processes the input parameters in some manner. Since there is no specific output description provided, we will focus on the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (a positive integer), n (a positive integer), x (an integer), and s (a binary string of length n).**
