The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The state of the other variables, including `prefix_balances` and `balance`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in the `prefix_balances` list, and the `results` list now includes `-1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, `x` is present in the `prefix_balances` list, and the `results` list now includes `-1`**
