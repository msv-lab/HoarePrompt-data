According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which means it has exceeded `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n`, and `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on `s[i - 1]`, `i` is `n`, `n` is unchanged**
