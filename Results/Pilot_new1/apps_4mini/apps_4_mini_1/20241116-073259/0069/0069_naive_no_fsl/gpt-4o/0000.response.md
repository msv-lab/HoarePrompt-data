To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to evaluate whether it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We are given a binary string `s` and need to construct an infinite string `t` by repeating `s`.
2. We need to calculate the number of prefixes of `t` that have a balance equal to `x`, where balance is defined as the count of `0`s minus the count of `1`s in the prefix.
3. If there are infinitely many prefixes with the desired balance, we should return `-1`.

### Key Points of the Implementation:
1. The program calculates the overall balance of the string `s` and the balance of all prefixes of `s`.
2. If the overall balance is `0`, it checks if `x` is in the prefix balances. If `x` is found, it indicates infinite prefixes can have that balance, so it returns `-1`. If not found, it returns `0` since no prefixes can achieve that balance.
3. If the overall balance is not `0`, it checks how many prefixes can achieve the balance `x` by solving the equation `(x - b) % balance == 0` and ensuring the quotient is non-negative.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Infinite Prefixes**: If `s` consists of only `0`s or only `1`s, the balance will be zero, and if `x` is equal to the balance of any prefix, it should return `-1`.
2. **Negative and Large Values of `x`**: The logic should hold for negative values of `x`, as well as values much larger than the possible balances.
3. **Single Character Strings**: The program should handle cases where `n = 1` correctly, e.g., `s = '0'` or `s = '1'`.

### Test Cases:
- For `s = '0'` and `x = 0`, the output should be `1` (only the empty prefix).
- For `s = '1'` and `x = 0`, the output should be `0` (no prefix can achieve balance `0`).
- For `s = '01'` and `x = 0`, the output should be `1` (only the empty prefix).
- For `s = '00'` and `x = 2`, the output should be `-1` (infinite prefixes).

### Evaluation of the Code:
The code handles the described scenarios correctly based on the logic above. However, let's consider if it might fail:

1. If `s` has a balance of `0` and the prefix balances include `x`, it will return `-1`, which aligns with the requirement.
2. The handling of `(x - b) % balance == 0` ensures that it checks for the right conditions when the overall balance is not `0`, which should work for both negative and positive values of `x`.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and considering edge cases, I find that the program works as intended according to the problem description. I cannot find a case where it fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
