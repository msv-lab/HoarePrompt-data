The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers with values between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that their values range from 1 to `n·m·k`. The function's output is not explicitly provided in the prompt, so we cannot determine specific return values or cases based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and a, b are distinct integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). The specific return value of the function is not defined.**
