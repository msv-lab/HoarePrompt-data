Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are positive integers. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` cannot be calculated due to the undefined value of `b_floor`, and `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 while `b_block` remains based on an undefined value of `b`.***
