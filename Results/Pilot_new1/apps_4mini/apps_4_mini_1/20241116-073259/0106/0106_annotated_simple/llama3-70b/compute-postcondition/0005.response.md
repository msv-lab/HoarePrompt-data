To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the variables.

1. The variable `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
2. The initial state mentions that `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` are input positive integers, and `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
3. However, since the value of `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `b_block`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of the other variables and indicate that `b_block` is computed based on `b`, which is not defined.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `a` is an input positive integer, `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `b_block` is calculated based on an undefined value of `b`.**
