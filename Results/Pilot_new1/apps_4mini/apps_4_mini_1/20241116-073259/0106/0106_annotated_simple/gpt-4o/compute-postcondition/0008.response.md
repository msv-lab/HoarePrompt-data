The variable `reverse_walk_time` is calculated using the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are determined from the function `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`, respectively. The previous values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are necessary to compute `reverse_walk_time`. 

Since `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are known, we can compute `reverse_walk_time` based on the formula provided. However, as the specific values of `block_a` and `block_b` are not given, we can only express `reverse_walk_time` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
