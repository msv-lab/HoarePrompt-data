Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, if `floor_a` is greater than 1, then `time_to_exit` is at least 11, specifically calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a - 1`.***
