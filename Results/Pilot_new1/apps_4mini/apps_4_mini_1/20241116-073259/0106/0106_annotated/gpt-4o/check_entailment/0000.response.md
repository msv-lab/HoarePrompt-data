To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and annotations in detail.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The building has `n` blocks (entrances), each with `m` floors, and each floor has `k` apartments.
2. Apartments are numbered sequentially.
3. Edward can move between floors, blocks, and use the elevator with defined time costs.
4. The goal is to compute the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

### Code Analysis:
- **Function `get_location(apartment)`**:
  - It calculates the block and floor based on the apartment number.
  - It appears to correctly compute:
    - `block`: Which entrance the apartment belongs to.
    - `floor`: Which floor within that entrance the apartment is located on.
  
- **Function `func_1(n, m, k, a, b)`**:
  - It retrieves the locations of Edward (`a`) and Natasha (`b`) using `get_location`.
  - It calculates the time required for Edward to exit his current floor, walk to Natasha's block, and then reach her floor.
  - The time to exit is calculated based on whether Edward is on the first floor or not.
  - The walking time is calculated in both directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise) and the minimum is chosen.
  - The time to reach Natasha's floor is computed based on the difference in their floor numbers.

### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations indicate potential states of the program after certain computations.
- They mention that the function does not account for the case where `b` is on the same floor as `a`, which could simplify the walking time calculation.

### Critical Observation:
The code does not handle the case where Edward and Natasha are on the same floor. In such a scenario, the walking time should be `0`, but the current implementation will still compute a walking time based on block differences, which is incorrect.

### Example Case:
Consider the following:
- Letâ€™s say `n = 2`, `m = 1`, `k = 5` (thus apartments are numbered 1 to 10).
- Edward is in apartment `3` and Natasha is in apartment `8`.
- Both apartments are on the same floor (1st floor), but the code will calculate a walking time based on block differences, leading to potentially incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the scenario where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor, leading to an incorrect walking time calculation. Thus, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
