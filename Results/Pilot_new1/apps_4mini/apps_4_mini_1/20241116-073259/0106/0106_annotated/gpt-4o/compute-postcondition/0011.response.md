To determine the output state, we first need to identify the values of the variables involved in the calculation of `total_time`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, `floor_b`, or `time_to_exit`, we cannot compute exact numerical values for `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, or `time_to_target_floor`.

Given this, we can summarize the relationships between the variables without specific numerical outputs. The `total_time` is dependent on the previously calculated variables. Therefore, the output state will reflect the dependencies and calculations involved without specific values.

Output State: **`total_time` is calculated as `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`, where `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, and `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.**
