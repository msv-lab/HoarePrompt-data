The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment`, which represents the apartment number in a building. It calculates two values: `block` and `floor`. The `block` is determined by dividing the `apartment` number by the product of `m` and `k`, and the `floor` is calculated based on the remainder of that division. The function returns both `block` and `floor`.

However, the function relies on the variables `m` and `k` being defined elsewhere in the code, which could lead to a `NameError` if they are not defined. Additionally, there are no checks for negative or zero values for the `apartment`, which could result in unexpected behavior or incorrect calculations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `apartment`, calculates the `block` and `floor` based on the values of `m` and `k`, and returns these values. It does not handle potential errors related to undefined variables `m` and `k`, nor does it validate the input for negative or zero apartment numbers. **
