To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial state mentions that `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`. This means `direct_walk_time` has already been computed using the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.
2. The new line of code calculates `reverse_walk_time` using the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
3. The calculation for `reverse_walk_time` depends on the same values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` used in the calculation of `direct_walk_time`.
4. The value of `reverse_walk_time` is computed but does not affect the previously calculated `direct_walk_time`.

Now we summarize the output state:

- `direct_walk_time` remains unchanged.
- `reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`.

Since we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`, we cannot compute exact numerical results, but we can state that `reverse_walk_time` has been calculated.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`**
