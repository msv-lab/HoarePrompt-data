Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous values; `a_block` is calculated from user input values of `a` and `m`; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; and `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. This covers the scenario where `a_floor` equals `b_floor`, ensuring that the time calculation reflects the correct difference in floors regardless of whether `a_floor` is greater than, less than, or equal to `b_floor`.***
