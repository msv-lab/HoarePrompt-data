Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` retain their previous values; `a_block` is calculated from user input values of `a` and `m`; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the output is the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
