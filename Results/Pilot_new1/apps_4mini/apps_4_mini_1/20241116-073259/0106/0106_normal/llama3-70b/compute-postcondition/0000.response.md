The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values based on the input provided by the user. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not known but are constrained to be positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. The variables `a` and `b` remain unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values assigned to `n`, `m`, and `k` based on user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values based on user input; `a` and `b` remain distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.**
