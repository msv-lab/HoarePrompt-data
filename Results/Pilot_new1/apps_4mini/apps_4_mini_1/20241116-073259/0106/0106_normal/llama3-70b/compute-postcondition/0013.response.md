The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value or behavior based on the output. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not clearly defined without additional information regarding its output or operations. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly, but operates under specific constraints for n, m, k, a, and b. The output behavior is unspecified.**
