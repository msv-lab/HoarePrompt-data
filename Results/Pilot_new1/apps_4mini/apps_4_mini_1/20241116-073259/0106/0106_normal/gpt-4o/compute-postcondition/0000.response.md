The variable `block` is assigned the value of the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, while `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers within the range of 1 to `n * m * k` and are distinct from each other. Since the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical result for `block`. Therefore, the output state reflects the expression used to calculate `block` and the constraints on the variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
