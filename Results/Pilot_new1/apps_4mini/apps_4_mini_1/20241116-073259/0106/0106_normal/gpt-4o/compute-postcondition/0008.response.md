The variable `reverse_walk_time` is calculated using the formula `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The values of `block_a` and `block_b` are derived from the function `get_location(a)` and `get_location(b)`, while `n` is a positive integer. The calculation involves finding the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, subtracting it from `n`, and taking the modulus with `n`, then multiplying the result by 15.

Since `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b` are positive integers, the calculation will yield a non-negative integer for `reverse_walk_time`. The specific values of `block_a` and `block_b` are not provided, but they do not affect the overall structure of the output state.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.**
