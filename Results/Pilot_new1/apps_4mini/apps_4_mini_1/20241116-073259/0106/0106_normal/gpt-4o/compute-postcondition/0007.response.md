Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an apartment number; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.**
