To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step and identify any potential issues.

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of blocks (n), floors (m), and apartments per floor (k), as well as the apartment numbers (a and b) where Edward and Natasha live.

2. **Calculating Floor and Block**:
   - `a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1`: This correctly calculates the floor number for apartment `a`.
   - `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`: This correctly calculates the block number for apartment `a`.
   - The same calculations are performed for apartment `b`.

3. **Calculating Time to Move Between Blocks**:
   - `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`: This correctly calculates the minimum time to move between blocks, considering the circular nature of the building.

4. **Calculating Time to Move Between Floors**:
   - The program checks if `a_floor > b_floor` to determine whether Edward needs to go up or down.
   - The time calculation includes the lift wait time (10 seconds) and the time taken to move between floors (5 seconds per floor).
   - However, the logic here is flawed. If Edward is currently on the same floor as Natasha (i.e., `a_floor == b_floor`), the lift wait time should not be included, since he can immediately access the first floor of his block.

### Potential Issue:
For the case where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor (`a_floor == b_floor`), the program incorrectly adds the lift wait time of 10 seconds, which is not necessary since he can directly walk to Natasha's apartment.

**Example Case**:
Consider the input:
```
1 1 1
1 2
```
In this case:
- Edward is in apartment 1 (block 1, floor 1).
- Natasha is in apartment 2 (which does not exist in this configuration since there is only 1 apartment). 

This indicates that the program does not handle edge cases correctly as it assumes apartments will always be available based on the input parameters.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic for cases where both individuals are on the same floor, leading to incorrect time calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
