According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k`. Since `n` does not affect the execution of the loop directly, it does not need to be adjusted. However, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 1, as that is the starting point of the loop. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
