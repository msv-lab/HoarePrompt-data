According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, which means `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to run again. 

Since `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` will be 4 in the next iteration. Therefore, `k` must be adjusted to be at least 4 to allow the loop to execute one more time. The other states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, and `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2 based on `n % 3.**
