To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the logic and check if it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to determine if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to check if there are any pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The function checks if `k >= n`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it immediately returns 'No'. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders for `n % n` and `n % 1` will always be the same, which is `0`. Thus, at least one pair of indices will yield the same remainder.

2. **Loop Execution**: The program iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i` for each `i`. It uses a set to track seen remainders. If a remainder is found that has already been seen, it returns 'No'.

3. **Distinct Remainders Logic**: The program correctly adds each new remainder to the `seen_remainders` set. If all remainders are unique, it will return 'Yes' after the loop.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: When `k` is `1`. The only remainder calculated will be `n % 1`, which is `0`. This will always be distinct since there are no other remainders to compare against.
  
- **Case 2**: When `k` is `n`. The program will return 'No' because `k >= n` condition is satisfied.

- **Case 3**: When `k` is less than `n` but greater than `1`, the program should handle all combinations of remainders correctly.

### Testing Cases:
1. **Input**: `4 4` should return `No` (correct).
2. **Input**: `5 3` should return `Yes` (correct).
3. **Input**: `7 7` should return `No` (correct).
4. **Input**: `10 5` should return `Yes` since remainders will be distinct: `10 % 1 = 0`, `10 % 2 = 0`, `10 % 3 = 1`, `10 % 4 = 2`, `10 % 5 = 0`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies when `k >= n` and handles the distinct remainders logic appropriately. However, the program does not explicitly handle the case when `k` is `1`, which will always yield a single remainder of `0`, and thus should return `Yes` since there are no pairs to compare. 

Given that it fails to handle this edge case correctly, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
