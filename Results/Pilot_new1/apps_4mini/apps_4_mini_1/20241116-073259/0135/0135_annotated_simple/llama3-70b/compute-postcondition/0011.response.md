The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is now `n % 2`, and the output is 'No'.**
