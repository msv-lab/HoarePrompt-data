The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle two integers, `n` and `k`, which are constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). However, since the function does not take any input parameters directly, the specifics of how `n` and `k` are utilized or returned are not provided in the output. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact functionality or return value based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly and its return value is unspecified based on the given information.**
