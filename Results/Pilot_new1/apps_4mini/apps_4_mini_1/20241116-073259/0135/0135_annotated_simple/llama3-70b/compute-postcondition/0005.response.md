The code prints 'No'. The values of the variables do not change as the print statement does not affect the state of `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, or `remainder`. Therefore, the output state remains the same with the addition of the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the output is 'No'**
