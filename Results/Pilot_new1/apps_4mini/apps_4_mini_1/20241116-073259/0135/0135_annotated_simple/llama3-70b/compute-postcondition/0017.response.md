The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder`) do not change as the print statement does not affect their state. Therefore, the output state remains the same for the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is now `n % 3, and the output is 'No'**
