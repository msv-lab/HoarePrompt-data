The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 3, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. Therefore, `remainder` can either be 0, 1, or 2, depending on the value of `n`. However, since `remainder` is specified to be either 0 or 1, it indicates that `n` must be such that it gives a remainder of either 0 or 1 when divided by 3. 

Thus, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `seen_remainders` is an empty set; `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 3; `seen_remainders` is an empty set; `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
