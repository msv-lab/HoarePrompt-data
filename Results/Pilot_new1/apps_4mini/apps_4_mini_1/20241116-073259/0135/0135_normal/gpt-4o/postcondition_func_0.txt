The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the function calculates the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found to be a duplicate during this process, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and the function does not return a value, which could lead to undefined behavior.
