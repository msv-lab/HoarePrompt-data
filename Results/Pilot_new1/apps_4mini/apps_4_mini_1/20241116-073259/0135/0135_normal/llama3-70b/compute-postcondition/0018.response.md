The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables do not change, but we exit the program without returning any specific value. The output state reflects the current values of the variables before the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now {remainder}, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is `n % 3` and we exit the program.**
