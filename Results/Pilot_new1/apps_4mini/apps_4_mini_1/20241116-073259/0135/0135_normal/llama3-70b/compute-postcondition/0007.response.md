Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set that may contain the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits without making further changes. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution beyond this point, potentially allowing for further operations with `n`, `k`, and other variables.***
