The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 3, the new value of `remainder` will be `n % 3`. The previous value of `remainder` was `n % 2`, but it will be updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now {remainder}, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is `n % 3**
