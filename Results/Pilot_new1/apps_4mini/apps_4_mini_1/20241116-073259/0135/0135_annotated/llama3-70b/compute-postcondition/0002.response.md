According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 1, as the range starts at 1 and goes up to `k` inclusive. Since `n` is an input positive integer and does not affect the loop execution, it remains unchanged. The variable `i` will start at 1 as per the loop definition. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least 1, and `i` will start at 1. 

State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
