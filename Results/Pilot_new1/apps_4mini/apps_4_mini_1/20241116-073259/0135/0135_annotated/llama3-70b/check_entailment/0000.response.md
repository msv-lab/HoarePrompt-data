To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its behavior against the problem description and the annotations.

### Problem Description Summary:
The task is to check if the remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that for any pair `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n % i != n % j` holds. If all remainders are distinct, we print "Yes"; otherwise, we print "No".

### Annotations Summary:
The annotated program describes that it reads two integers `n` and `k`, then checks for duplicate remainders by storing them in a set. If a duplicate is found, it prints "No" and exits. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes". The annotation mentions that if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, which is not relevant here since `k` is always at least 1 based on the problem constraints.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Remainder Calculation**: It iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i` for each `i`.
3. **Distinct Check**: It uses a set to track seen remainders. If a remainder is found in the set, it prints "No" and exits.
4. **Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case when `k = 1` correctly. The only remainder would be `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Thus, there are no duplicates.
- The program does not explicitly handle the case when `k` is very large compared to `n`. However, since the range of `i` is limited to `k`, the program can still function correctly.
- The program's logic for checking duplicates is sound, as it utilizes a set, which inherently manages uniqueness.

### Potential Issue:
While the program appears to function correctly for the given examples and the logic seems sound, we need to consider the mathematical properties of modulo operation. For instance:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 4`, the remainders are `0, 1, 2, 3` (distinct).
- For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders are `0, 1, 2` (distinct).

However, consider a case where `n = 6` and `k = 4`:
- The remainders would be `0, 1, 2, 3` (all distinct).
- If `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` (all distinct).

In fact, the program will always find distinct remainders for the range of `i` from `1` to `k` as long as `k` is less than or equal to `n`. 

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to check for distinct remainders as specified in the problem description. It handles the cases well, and the annotations align with the functionality described in the code.

Correctness: **True**
