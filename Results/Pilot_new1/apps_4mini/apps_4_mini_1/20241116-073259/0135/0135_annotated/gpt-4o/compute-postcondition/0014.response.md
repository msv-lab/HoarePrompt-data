Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute at most k times, with `seen_remainders` containing the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to k. If a remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. After the loop, `i` will be k, and `seen_remainders` will contain unique remainders from the calculations `n % 1`, `n % 2`, ..., `n % k`.**
