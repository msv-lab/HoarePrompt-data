The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 3, and since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n`, the possible values for `remainder` can be either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1 based on the calculation of `n % 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1 based on `n % 3**
