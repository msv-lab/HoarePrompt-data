The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case_1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. 
- In Case_2, if `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return any value, but if `k` is at least 1, it checks for unique remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k`, and if a remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'. 
- In Case_3, if none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on their values, it either returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, does not return anything if `k` is less than `n`, or returns 'Yes' if all conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, does not return any value if `k` is less than `n`, and returns 'Yes' if the conditions for unique remainders are satisfied.**
