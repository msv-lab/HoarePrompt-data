To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description. The goal is to check if all remainders of `n` when divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Initial Check**: If `k >= n`, the function returns 'No'. This is because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, `n % n` will be `0`, and `n % 1` will also be `0`, which means there are at least two identical remainders.
3. **Remainders Calculation**: The program uses a loop to compute `n % i` for each `i` from `1` to `k`, storing the results in a set to track seen remainders.
4. **Distinct Check**: If a remainder is found that already exists in the set, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set.
5. **Final Output**: If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

### Potential Cases to Test

1. **Case Where k = n**: For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 5`, the output should be 'No' because `5 % 5 = 0` and `5 % 1 = 0`, which are not distinct. The program correctly returns 'No'.
  
2. **Case Where k < n**: For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders would be:
   - `5 % 1 = 0`
   - `5 % 2 = 1`
   - `5 % 3 = 2`
   All remainders are distinct, so the output should be 'Yes', and the program correctly returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Case with Large Values**: If we consider `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`, the program should return 'No' since `n % n` and `n % 1` will both equal `0`.

4. **Small Values**: If we test with small values, such as `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be 'Yes' since `1 % 1 = 0` and there are no other remainders.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the logic in the program and testing it against these potential cases, it appears that the program handles the requirements as described in the problem statement correctly. 

Thus, I cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
