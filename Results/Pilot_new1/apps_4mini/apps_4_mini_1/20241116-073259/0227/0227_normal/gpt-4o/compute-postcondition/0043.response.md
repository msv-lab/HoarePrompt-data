The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown, so we cannot determine its new value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `m` is unchanged, and `i` is 2, with `m` being increased by 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `m` is increased by 1**
