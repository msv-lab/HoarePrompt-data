The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state indicates that `a` contains `n` distinct integers, but the specific values of `a` are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` is now sorted, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers**
