The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer satisfies the constraint \(1 \leq a_k \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns the count of elements in the list `a` that could not be formed by the difference of any two elements in a variable referred to as `assigned`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, and returns the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in `assigned`.**
