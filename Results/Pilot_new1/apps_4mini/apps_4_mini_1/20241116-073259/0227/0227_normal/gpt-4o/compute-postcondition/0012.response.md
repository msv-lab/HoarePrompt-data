The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is `a[1]`, and `can_form` is True.
