Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and at least one more distinct integer from `a`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is `a[1]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
