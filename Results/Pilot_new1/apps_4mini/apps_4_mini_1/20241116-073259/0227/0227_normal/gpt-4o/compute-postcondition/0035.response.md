Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `can_form` is set to True if the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is satisfied, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `x` is the second element in `assigned`.***
