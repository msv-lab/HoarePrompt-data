The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `m`, and `assigned`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
