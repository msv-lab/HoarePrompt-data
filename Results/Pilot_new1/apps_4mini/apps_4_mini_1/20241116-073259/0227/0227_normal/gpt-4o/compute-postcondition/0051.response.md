The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[3]`), `n` is greater than 3, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[3] - x` is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
