The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `assigned` contains at least one element, `can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element in assigned, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element in `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
