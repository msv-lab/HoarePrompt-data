Postcondition: ***If `n` is at least 2 and `assigned` contains at least `a[0]`, if `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False and `m` is unchanged. If `assigned` contains only `a[0]`, the loop executes once and checks if `a[i] - a[0]` is in `assigned`, which will not be true for `i` equal to 1, leaving `can_form` as False and `m` unchanged. If `assigned` contains more than one element, `can_form` may be set to True during the loop execution, and `m` remains unchanged in this case. Overall, `m` is incremented by 1 only when `can_form` is False.***
