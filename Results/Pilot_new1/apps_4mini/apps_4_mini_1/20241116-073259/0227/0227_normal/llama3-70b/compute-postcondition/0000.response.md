The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input integer that must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a_k satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a_k satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9**
