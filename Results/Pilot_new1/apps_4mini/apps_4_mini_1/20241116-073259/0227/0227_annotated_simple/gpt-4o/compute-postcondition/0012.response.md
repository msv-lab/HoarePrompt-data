The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as no other variables are modified by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables while indicating the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**.
