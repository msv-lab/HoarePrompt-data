The value of `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, and the other variables (`i`, `n`, `assigned`, and `x`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `can_form`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned**
