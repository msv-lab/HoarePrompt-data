The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and one additional element, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x` is that new element, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
