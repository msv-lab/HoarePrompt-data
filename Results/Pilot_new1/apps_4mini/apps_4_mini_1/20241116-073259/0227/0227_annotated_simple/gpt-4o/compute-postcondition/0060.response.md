Postcondition: ***`assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and at least 3 elements, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
