The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. The state of `can_form` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, and `m` is increased by 1**
