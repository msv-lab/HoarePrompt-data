Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not found in `assigned`, the value of `can_form` remains False, indicating that the condition was not satisfied.***
