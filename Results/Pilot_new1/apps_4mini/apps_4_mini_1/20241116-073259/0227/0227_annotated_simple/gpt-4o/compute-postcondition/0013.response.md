The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
