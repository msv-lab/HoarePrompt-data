Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether the difference between `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) and any element `x` in `assigned` exists within `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. Since `assigned` includes at least `a[i]`, where `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1, the program ensures that `m` is incremented only when `can_form` is false, capturing all scenarios where `assigned` may be empty or where differences do not yield a valid result.***
