Postcondition: ***`assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and one additional element, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is that new element. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues without any further action.***
