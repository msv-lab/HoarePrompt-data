The function `func` accepts input from the user, where the first input is an integer `n` representing the number of subsequent integers. It then reads a list of `n` integers, sorts this list, and counts how many of those integers do not equal twice the previous integer in the sorted list. The count starts at 1, and the function increments this count for each integer that does not meet the doubling condition. 

After completing the count, if the count `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. 

It's important to note that if `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 1. The function does not handle cases where the input might not be valid (e.g., if the user inputs a non-integer or if the number of integers does not match `n`).

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, reads `n` integers, counts how many of those integers do not equal twice the previous integer in a sorted list, and prints the count if it is 23 or less; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, it directly prints 1. **
