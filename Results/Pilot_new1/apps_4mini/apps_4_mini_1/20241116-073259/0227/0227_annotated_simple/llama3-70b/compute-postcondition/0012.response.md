The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is increased by 1, and `i` is 2. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is increased by 1, `i` is 2**
