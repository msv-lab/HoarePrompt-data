The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 23 \). The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers, where each integer \( a_k \) satisfies \( 1 \leq a_k \leq 10^9 \). 

The output of the function is not explicitly stated, but based on the provided constraints and relationships, the functionality of the function can be inferred. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is between 1 and \( 10^9 \).**
