To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both the problem statement and the code implementation.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the minimum number of variables `m` such that a sequence of operations can be performed using these variables. The operations include assigning a value from the sequence to a variable and subsequently assigning new values as the sum of previously assigned values.

### Analyzing the Code:
The provided function `func_1` does the following:
1. It sorts the input list `a`.
2. It initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of the values that have been assigned to variables.
3. It starts with the first value assigned and iterates through the rest of the values in `a`.
4. For each value in `a`, it checks if it can be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values.
5. If it can't be formed, it increments the count of variables `m`.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Initial Assignment**: The code assumes that the first value can always be assigned to one variable, which is correct.
2. **Sum Formation Check**: The code checks if the current value can be formed by the sum of any two assigned values. However, it does not check if the current value is the sum of two distinct assigned values, which is a requirement.
3. **Handling Cases with No Valid `m`**: The code does not return `-1` when it is impossible to form the next required value from the existing assigned values. This is a crucial part of the problem statement.

### Edge Case:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
In this case:
- The first value `3` can be assigned to a variable.
- The second value `6` can be formed as `3 + 3`, but the problem requires that two distinct variables must be used. Since we only have one variable assigned with value `3`, we cannot form `6`. The program should return `-1`, but it will incorrectly increment `m` and return `2`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where it is impossible to perform the required operations correctly, as it fails to check for distinct variables when forming sums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
