Postcondition: ***`assigned` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `x` is the fourth element in the `assigned` list. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged and the program continues without any modifications to `can_form`.***
