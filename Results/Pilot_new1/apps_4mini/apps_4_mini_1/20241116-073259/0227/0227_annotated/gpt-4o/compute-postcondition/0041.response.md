Output State: **If `assigned` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a`, then `can_form` will be set to True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` is found after iterating through `assigned`, `can_form` remains False and `m` is unchanged. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False, and `m` remains unchanged.**
