Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` includes `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `m` is unchanged, `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
