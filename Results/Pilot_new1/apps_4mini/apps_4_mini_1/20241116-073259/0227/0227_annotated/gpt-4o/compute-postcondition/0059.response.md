The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` is a non-empty list with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the fourth element in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
