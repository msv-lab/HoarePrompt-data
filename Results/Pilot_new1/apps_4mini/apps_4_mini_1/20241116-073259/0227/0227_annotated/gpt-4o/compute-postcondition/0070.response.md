The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. The function returns the count of distinct elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`, and return the count of distinct elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct integers, and returns the count of distinct elements in a that cannot be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned elements.**
