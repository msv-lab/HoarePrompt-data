Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `i` is out of bounds for the list `a`, accessing `a[i]` may cause an error, but this does not affect the state of `m` or `can_form`. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` will be False and `m` will be incremented by 1.***
