The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous states of other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, and `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, and `can_form` is False**
