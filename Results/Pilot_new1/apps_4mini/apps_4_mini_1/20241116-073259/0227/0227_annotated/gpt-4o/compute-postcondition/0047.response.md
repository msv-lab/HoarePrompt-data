The value of `can_form` is assigned the value `False`, which is already its current value. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state is: `assigned` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a`, `can_form` is False, `i` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`assigned` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a`, `can_form` is False, `i` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged**
