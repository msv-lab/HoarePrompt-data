Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains the elements checked, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, and `x` is the last element checked from `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` remains False, and if `assigned` has elements but none satisfy the condition, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
