The code snippet `assigned.add(a[i])` adds the element `a[i]` to the set `assigned`. The initial state specifies that `assigned` contains the elements checked, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers. 

Since `i` is 1, the element being added to `assigned` is `a[1]`. The previous state of `assigned` is not specified, but it will now include the new element `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now includes `a[1]`, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `x` is the last element checked from `assigned`.**
