Output State: **`can_form` is set to True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that `(a[i] - x)` is also in `assigned`, where `x` is an element of `assigned`. If no such element exists after iterating through all elements in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. Additionally, if `i` is out of bounds for the list `a`, it may cause an error when accessing `a[i]`.**
