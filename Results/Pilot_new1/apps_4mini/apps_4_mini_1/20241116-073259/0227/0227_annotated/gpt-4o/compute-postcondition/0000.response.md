The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the sorting operation will rearrange the elements of `a` without changing `n`. The previous values of the elements in `a` are distinct integers between 1 and 10^9, and after sorting, the elements will be in increasing order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9**
