Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `m` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
