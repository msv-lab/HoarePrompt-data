The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of the assigned list, and the value of (a[2] - x) is an element of the `assigned` list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
