The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. The function does not have any explicit output described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers.**
