The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of subsequent integers, followed by a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in `a` are not equal to twice the preceding element in the sorted list. If the count `m` exceeds 23, the function returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count `m`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or negative, which could lead to input errors.
