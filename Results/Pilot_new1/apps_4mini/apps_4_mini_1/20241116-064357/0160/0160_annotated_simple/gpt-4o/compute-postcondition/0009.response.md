Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the set `divisors`, and the value `x // i` is also added to `divisors`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `i` is greater than `sqrt(x)`, then `x` must be at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)` to ensure that the divisor logic is correctly applied.***
