To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its functionality.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the maximum positive integer that divides every element of a sequence after performing a limited number of operations (adding 1 to one element and subtracting 1 from another). The operations can be performed up to K times.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code consists of two functions:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function computes the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of a list of integers. The GCD of a list gives the largest integer that divides all the elements in that list.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function computes the divisors of a given integer `x` and returns them in descending order.

### Logic of the Program:
The program is expected to:
- Compute the GCD of the list of integers, which represents the largest integer that divides all elements initially.
- Adjust the values of the integers within the constraints of K operations to potentially find a larger common divisor.

### Missing Logic:
However, the code does not implement the logic of performing the operations (adding and subtracting) to potentially modify the array `A` and find the maximum divisor after the operations. The GCD of the modified array is not computed after performing operations, which is essential to meet the problem's requirement. 

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
2 5
10 20
```
- Initially, the GCD of 10 and 20 is 10. 
- If we perform operations, we can only decrease one element and increase the other. 
- The maximum positive integer that can divide both elements after performing operations is actually 5 (since we can perform operations to make them both multiples of 5).

The current implementation does not account for this and will just return the GCD of the original numbers without considering the allowed operations.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not handle the operations as specified in the problem description and does not compute the maximum divisor after performing the operations, it can fail to produce the correct result for certain inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
