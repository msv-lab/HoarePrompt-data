Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` found by iterating `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, adding both `i` and `x // i` when `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is 1, the loop executes once, adding 1 to `divisors`. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is not a perfect square, both `i` and `x // i` will be distinct for each divisor found. The loop will not execute if `x` is less than 1, leading to an unchanged empty set for `divisors`.**
