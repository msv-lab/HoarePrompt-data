Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6; `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1; `x` is at least `((int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)`; if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are added to the set of divisors. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, no changes are made to the divisors set.***
