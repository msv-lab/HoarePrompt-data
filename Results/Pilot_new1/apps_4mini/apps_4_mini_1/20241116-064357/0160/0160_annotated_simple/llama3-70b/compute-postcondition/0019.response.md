According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `gcd`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `N - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `N`. However, since `N` is greater than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the loop cannot execute again.

Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `gcd` such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least `N - 1`. This means that `gcd` must be greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is `N - 1`**
