The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is `N - 1`, the value of `max_divisor` will be updated to the greater of its current value or `N - 1`. The values of `gcd` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is `N - 1`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `N - 1`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is `N - 1`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `N - 1**
