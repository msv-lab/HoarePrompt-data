Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is `N - 1`, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Thus, `max_divisor` will be the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to `N - 1`, or equal to `gcd` itself, depending on the conditions met.***
