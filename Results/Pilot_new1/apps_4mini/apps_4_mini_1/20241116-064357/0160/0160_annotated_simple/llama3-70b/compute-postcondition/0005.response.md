According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `N` is an integer between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `N` is at least 2, it is still valid for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` being incremented to 2. The other states remain unchanged.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers from input, `gcd` is math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 2**
