The variable `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. The value of `i` is `N`, and since `max_divisor` is compared with `i`, it will either retain its previous value or be updated to `N`, depending on which is greater. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is `N`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value or `N`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N - 1) * (N - 1)`, `i` is N, and `max_divisor` is updated to max(max_divisor, N)**
