According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the value of `i` would be `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

Since `i` is currently at `int(math.sqrt(x))`, the loop will not execute again unless `x` is adjusted such that the new value of `i` (which becomes `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`) is still within the range. This means `x` must be adjusted so that `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` is still a valid integer in the range of the loop, which implies that `x` should be at least `(int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1) ** 2`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `x` is now at least `(int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1) ** 2`, and `i` should be `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `x` is at least `(int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1) ** 2`, `divisors` is a set that includes `i` and `x // i`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
