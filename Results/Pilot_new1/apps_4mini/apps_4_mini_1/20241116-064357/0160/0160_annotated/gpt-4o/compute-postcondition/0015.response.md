Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` found during the loop execution. The loop executes for each integer `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, adding both `i` and `x // i` to `divisors` if `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` is a prime number, only 1 and `x` will be added to `divisors`.**
