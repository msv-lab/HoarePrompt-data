The function accepts a list of integers `lst` with at least 2 elements and returns the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of all elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will not execute the loop, and `gcd_result` will be equal to the first element of the list, which may not be meaningful in terms of GCD computation. Therefore, it is important that the input list has at least 2 elements for the function to behave as intended.
