According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i`, which iterates from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has reached its maximum value of `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which is the value at the start of the next iteration. However, since the loop's range is defined as `range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1)`, this means that the loop will not execute again because `i` will be equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, which is outside the loop's defined range.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Since `i` will be `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` at the start of the next iteration, we need to ensure that it reflects this value.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `x` is at least (int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1), `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
