According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. This means that `i` has already exceeded the upper limit of the loop condition. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted back to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

The value of `x` does not need to be adjusted since it remains the same, and the condition for `x` being divisible by `i` is not relevant for this specific loop execution condition.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each integer A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `x` is at least (int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1), and `i` is int(math.sqrt(x))**
