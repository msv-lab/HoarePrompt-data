According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is at least 1, and `i` has taken some value in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to adjust the value of `i`. Since the loop iterates over the range starting from 1, if `i` is currently at its maximum value (which is `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`), the loop will not execute again. If `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, it will increment for the next iteration.

Thus, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration, and we need to check if `i` has reached the maximum limit. If `i` is currently equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we need to adjust `gcd` to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is still valid for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now one greater than its previous value, and we need to check the condition for `gcd` and `i`.

State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is updated as necessary, `i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., now `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`)**
