Postcondition: ***`gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1, and `i` is at least 2. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
