The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. The variable `i` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which means it is at least 2 since `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1. The state of `max_divisor` depends on its previous value, but since we do not have that information, we can only state that it is being updated. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 1, `i` is at least 2, and `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`**
