The variable `A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`, which takes a space-separated string of integers from user input and converts each to an integer. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. The output state reflects that `A` is now a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers from user input**
