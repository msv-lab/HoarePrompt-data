According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `gcd`. The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` contains at least one integer. This means that `gcd` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing. 

If `N` is at least 2, `gcd` is the gcd of all elements in `A`, which should be greater than or equal to 1 if the elements in `A` are positive. If `N` is less than 2, `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, and we need to ensure that `A[0]` is also at least 1.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `gcd` is at least 1, and we also need to initialize `i` to 1 since that is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`gcd` is at least 1, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is 1**
