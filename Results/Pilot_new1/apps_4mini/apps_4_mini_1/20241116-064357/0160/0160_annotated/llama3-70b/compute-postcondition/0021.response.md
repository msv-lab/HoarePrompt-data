The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. The previous values indicate that `gcd` is at least 1 and `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Since `gcd` is at least 1, `i` will be at least 2 (because the square root of 1 is 1, and adding 1 gives us 2). Therefore, `gcd // i` will be at least `gcd // 2` if `gcd` is greater than or equal to 2. The output state reflects the updated value of `max_divisor`.

Output State: **`gcd` is at least 1; `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`.**
