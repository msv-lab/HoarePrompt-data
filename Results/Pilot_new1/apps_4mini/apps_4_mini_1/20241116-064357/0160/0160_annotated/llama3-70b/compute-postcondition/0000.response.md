The values of `N` and `K` are assigned from the input, where `input()` accepts a string of two integers separated by space, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not directly defined in the initial state, but we know their constraints. Therefore, the output state reflects the input assignment.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
