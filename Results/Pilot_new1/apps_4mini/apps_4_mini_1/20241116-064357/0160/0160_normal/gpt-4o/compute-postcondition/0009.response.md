Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, and `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). If `x` is divisible by `i`, the set `divisors` will include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged. This ensures that all divisors of `x` up to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` are considered in the set.***
