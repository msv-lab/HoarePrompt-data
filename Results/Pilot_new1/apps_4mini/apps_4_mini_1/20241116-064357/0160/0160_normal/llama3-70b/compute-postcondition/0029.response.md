According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

From the provided state, `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(current_value + 1)`, which does not directly affect the loop execution. However, we need to consider the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration to determine if the loop can execute again.

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, if `i` is currently equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now greater than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to `(current_value + 1)`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`**
