The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Given that `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, the expression simplifies to `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)`, where `gcd // i` is a positive integer since `gcd` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1. Thus, `gcd // i` equals `gcd`. Therefore, `max_divisor` remains unchanged as it is equal to `gcd`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd**
