The values of `N` and `K` are assigned based on the input provided, where `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and \(10^9\). The previous values of `N` and `K` are overwritten with the new input values. The list `A` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `N` and `K` after the input is processed.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9**
