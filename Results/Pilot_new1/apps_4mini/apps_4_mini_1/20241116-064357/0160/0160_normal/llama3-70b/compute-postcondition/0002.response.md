The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. The values of `N`, `K`, and the rest of the list `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `gcd` is now equal to the first element of `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from user input, and `gcd` is equal to A[0]**
