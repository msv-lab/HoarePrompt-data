The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` (which is greater than 0) and `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`, we compare these two values. The output state will reflect the possible outcomes of `max_divisor` depending on the values of `gcd` and `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` can be either `gcd` or `i`, and `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than 0; `max_divisor` can be either `gcd` or `i`; `i` is equal to `current_value + 1**
