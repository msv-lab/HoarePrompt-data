According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and since `gcd` is greater than 0, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is a positive integer. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. If it is, then the loop can execute again, and `i` would be incremented by 1.

Since the state mentions that `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and `gcd` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be one more than its current value.

State: **`gcd` is greater than 0, `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, `i` is equal to `current_value + 1`** (where `current_value` is the value of `i` at the end of the last iteration).
