Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `t` is a positive integer, `_` is n-1, `min_time` is either unchanged or updated to `time`, and `ans` is either -1 or updated to `i + 1` (which is 1), where `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is set to `time` and `ans` is updated to 1, otherwise, `min_time` remains the same and `ans` stays at -1.***
