The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values based on the input provided, where `input()` accepts two integers separated by space, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now assigned the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
