The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of the `buses` variable while keeping the previous values of `n` and `t` unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list**
