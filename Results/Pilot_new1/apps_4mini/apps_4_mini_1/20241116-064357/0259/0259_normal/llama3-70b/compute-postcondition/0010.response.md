The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the existing list `buses`. The previous state of `buses` contains two tuples, and the values of `s` and `d` are input integers. The operation does not affect other variables such as `n`, `t`, or `_`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list of buses including the new tuple.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` now contains three tuples: the original two tuples and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is 2, and `s, d` are input integers**
