The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and for each bus route, `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000). 

The function's output is determined based on these constraints and relationships, but the specific return value is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the given information, we can outline the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates with constraints on positive integers n, t, s_i, and d_i, but does not take any explicit parameters or return values as described.**
