The `buses` list is modified by appending a new tuple `(s, d)` to it. The initial state indicates that `buses` already contains one tuple, and since `s` and `d` are input integers, they will be added as a new tuple to the existing list. Other variables like `n`, `t`, and `_` remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is 1**
