Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. After incrementing `i` by 1 and assigning `s_i` and `d_i` from `bus_routes[i]`, if `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is non-negative, as it represents the waiting time for the next bus.***
