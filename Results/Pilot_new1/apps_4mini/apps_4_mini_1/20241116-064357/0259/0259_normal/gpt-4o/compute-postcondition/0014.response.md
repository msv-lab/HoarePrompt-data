The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than `min_wait_time`, this means `min_wait_time` will now take on the value of `wait_time`, which is a positive integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `min_wait_time` and the unchanged state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer that is less than the original `min_wait_time`.**
