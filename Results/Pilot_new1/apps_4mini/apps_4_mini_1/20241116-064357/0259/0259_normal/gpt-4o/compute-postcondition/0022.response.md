Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is 0 if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` (which is `n`) remain unchanged, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.***
