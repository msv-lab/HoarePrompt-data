The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, `d_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[0]`, the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.
