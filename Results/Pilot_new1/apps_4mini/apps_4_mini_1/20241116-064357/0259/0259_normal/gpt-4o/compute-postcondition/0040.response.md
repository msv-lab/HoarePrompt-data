The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `s_i` and `d_i`, both of which are between 1 and 100000. After executing the function body, the program returns the index of the chosen bus route, which is referred to as `chosen_route`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the chosen bus route. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (an integer between 1 and 100000), and bus_routes (a list of tuples of integers). It returns the index of the chosen bus route.**
