The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity using `float('inf')`. This indicates that it is initialized to a very large number, which will likely be used for comparison later in the code. The values of the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**.
