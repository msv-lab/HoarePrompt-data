The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged, and the previous state of `i` is incremented by 1, while `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. However, the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the contents of `bus_routes`, which are not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `wait_time` and the increment of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` remains unchanged; `chosen_route` remains unchanged; `i` is incremented by 1; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`; `wait_time` is 0**
