Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is a non-negative integer equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `t - s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` remains a non-negative integer reflecting the next bus arrival time based on the current time `t` and the schedule defined by `d_i`. All cases ensure that `wait_time` is appropriately calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`.***
