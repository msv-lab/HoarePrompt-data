The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of -1. The previous values of the affected variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1**
