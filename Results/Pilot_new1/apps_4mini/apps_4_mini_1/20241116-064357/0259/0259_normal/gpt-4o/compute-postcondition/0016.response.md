Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer calculated based on the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the selection of the current route as the best option. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that `min_wait_time` always holds the smallest wait time encountered, and `chosen_route` reflects the index of the corresponding bus route.***
