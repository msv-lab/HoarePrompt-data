Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` (which is `n`) remain unchanged; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `t` is exactly aligned with `s_i` in terms of the bus's schedule (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, accounting for the next bus departure time.***
