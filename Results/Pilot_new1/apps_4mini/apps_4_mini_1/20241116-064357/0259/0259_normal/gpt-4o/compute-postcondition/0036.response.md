Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged unless `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` remains unchanged. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, no changes are made to `min_wait_time` or `chosen_route`. Additionally, `wait_time` is calculated as either `s_i - t` (if `s_i >= t`), 0 (if `s_i < t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), or `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` (ensuring it is non-negative).***
