According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the current iteration, and since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Currently, `i` is at its last value (which would be `n-1` after the last iteration), so to allow for one more iteration, `i` must be incremented to `n`, and we need to ensure that `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be set to `n` to reflect the start of the next iteration.
- No other states need to be adjusted as `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged, `i` is `n`**
