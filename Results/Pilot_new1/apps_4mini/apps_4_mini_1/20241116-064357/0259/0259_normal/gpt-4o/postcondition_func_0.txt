The function accepts an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains two integers representing the start time and frequency of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for a bus route based on the given start times and frequencies, and returns the index (1-indexed) of the bus route that results in the least wait time. If no valid bus routes are available (i.e., if `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating that there are no routes to choose from.
