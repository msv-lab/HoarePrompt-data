Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[0]. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is a non-negative integer calculated as `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always non-negative. This covers all scenarios, including edge cases where `s_i` equals `t` or the difference is exactly divisible by `d_i`.***
