According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `n` is already specified as a positive integer, it ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` which should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, and the values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged as they do not affect the loop execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
