Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always non-negative and reflects the next available bus based on the current time `t`.***
