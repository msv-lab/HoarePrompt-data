The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, we can determine that `wait_time` will be a positive integer. The values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculated `wait_time` based on the given conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[0], and `wait_time` is a positive integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
