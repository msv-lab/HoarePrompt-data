Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n - 1`, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, and `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, and `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`. This accounts for the scenario where the current time `t` aligns perfectly with the schedule, resulting in no wait time, as well as the case where there is a wait time needed before the next bus arrives.***
