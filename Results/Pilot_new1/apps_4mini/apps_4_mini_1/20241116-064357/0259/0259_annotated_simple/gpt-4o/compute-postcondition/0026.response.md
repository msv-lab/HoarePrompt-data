Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 2. This ensures that the minimum wait time reflects the shortest wait time available based on the conditions of `s_i` and `t`, while also accounting for all potential scenarios regarding the relationship between `s_i` and `t`. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged and `chosen_route` remains 1.***
