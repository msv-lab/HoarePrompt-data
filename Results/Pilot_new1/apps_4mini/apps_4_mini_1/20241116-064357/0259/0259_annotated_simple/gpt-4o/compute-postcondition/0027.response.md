According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100). 

Since the loop is indexed with `i`, we need to consider the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration. If `i` is currently `n - 1`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented to `n`, which means it can no longer execute. 

Therefore, to allow for one more iteration, we need to adjust `i` to be equal to `n - 1`. The value of `n` does not need to change, as it is already within the defined constraints (1 <= n <= 100). 

Since there are no other states that need to be adjusted based on the provided information, the final state should reflect that `i` is now `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `i` is n - 1**
