The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated by the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, but since the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time`. However, we can express `wait_time` in terms of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `wait_time` is calculated based on these variables, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
