The variable `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are used in this calculation, while `min_wait_time` is not directly affected by this specific line of code. 

Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is `n - 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`. The specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided, but they will be determined based on the `bus_routes` array.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculated `wait_time` based on the current values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]**
