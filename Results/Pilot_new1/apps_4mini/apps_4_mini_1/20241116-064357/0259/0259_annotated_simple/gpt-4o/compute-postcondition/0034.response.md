The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous value of `min_wait_time` is not provided, but it will now reflect the value of `wait_time`. Since no calculations are specified for `wait_time` in this code snippet, we cannot determine its value from the initial state provided. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, but we cannot specify the exact value of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`**
