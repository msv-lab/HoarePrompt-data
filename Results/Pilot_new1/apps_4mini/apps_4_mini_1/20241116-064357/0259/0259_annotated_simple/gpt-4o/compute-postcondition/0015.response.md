The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `chosen_route` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer based on the conditions of `s_i` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer based on the conditions of `s_i` and `t`.**
