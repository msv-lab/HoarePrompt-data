The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect the other variables in the initial state. The values of `n`, `t`, `min_wait_time`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`, and `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the previous value of `min_wait_time`, `i` is `n - 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`, and `wait_time` is 0**.
