Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from bus_routes[0]. The calculated `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer based on the conditions of `s_i` and `t`.***
