Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n - 1`, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n - 1]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` does not get updated. This ensures that `min_wait_time` reflects the shortest wait time calculated across the bus schedule scenarios, including cases where the bus departs before or after the given time `t`, or aligns perfectly with the schedule.***
