The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates based on certain constraints for the values it processes internally: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and for each bus route, `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot ascertain the specific return value or behavior of the function based on the given details.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on internal constraints related to integers n, t, s_i, and d_i. The specific output or functionality is not provided.**
