Postcondition: ***`buses` is unchanged, `min_time` remains unchanged if `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time`, and `ans` is set to 2, while `i` remains 1, `s` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d.***
