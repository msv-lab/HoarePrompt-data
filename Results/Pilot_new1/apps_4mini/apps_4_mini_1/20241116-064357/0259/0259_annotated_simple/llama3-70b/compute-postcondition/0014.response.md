The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of the other variables, `buses` and `min_time`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples; `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1.

Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples; `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1**
