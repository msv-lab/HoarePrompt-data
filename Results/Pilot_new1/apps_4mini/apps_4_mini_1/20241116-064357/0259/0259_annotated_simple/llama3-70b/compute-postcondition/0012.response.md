Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, each tuple consisting of input values `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from user input. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `buses` remains an empty list. The loop will execute exactly `n` times if `n` is at least 1, and `_` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.**
