Functionality: ** The function reads integers `n` and `t` from input, where `n` represents the number of buses. It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing the start time and duration of each bus. The function computes the minimum wait time for the buses based on the formula `(t - s) % d`. It returns the 1-based index of the bus with the minimum wait time. If no buses are provided (i.e., `n` is 0), it outputs -1, indicating that there are no buses available. **
