Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, `min_time` is either unchanged or updated to `time` if `time` is less than `min_time`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `ans` is set to 3; otherwise, `ans` remains 2. Additionally, `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d.***
