According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to execute `n` times, starting from `_` equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and since the loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, the next iteration will occur if `_` is less than `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, if the loop has executed `n` times, then `_` must be equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration. To execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`, which would mean that `n` must be adjusted to allow for one more iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to be at least `n + 1`, which is greater than the previous value of `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is `n`**
