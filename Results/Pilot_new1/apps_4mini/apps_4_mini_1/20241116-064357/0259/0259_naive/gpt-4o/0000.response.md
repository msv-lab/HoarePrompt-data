To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step-by-step.

The problem requires us to find which bus route Serval will take based on the time he arrives at the bus station and the schedule of the buses. 

### Code Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of bus routes), `t` (time Serval arrives), and `bus_routes` (a list of tuples containing the first bus arrival time and the interval).
   - The input is read and processed correctly.

2. **Logic Implementation:**
   - The program initializes `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
   - It iterates over each bus route:
     - If the first bus arrives after Serval's arrival time (`s_i >= t`), it calculates the wait time as `s_i - t`.
     - If Serval arrives exactly when a bus is scheduled (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), the wait time is set to 0.
     - If Serval arrives before the first bus and it isn't exactly at a bus time, it calculates the wait time to the next bus using `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
   - The chosen bus route is updated if the current route's wait time is less than the previously recorded minimum wait time.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Serval Arrives Exactly at the Time of a Bus:**
   - If `t` is exactly equal to `s_i` for any bus route, the wait time should be 0, which is correctly handled.

2. **Multiple Buses Arriving at the Same Time:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first bus that Serval can take, and if multiple buses arrive at the same time, it chooses the first one encountered in the loop, which aligns with the problem description.

3. **Serval Arrives Before All Buses:**
   - The calculation for wait time when Serval arrives before the first bus is also correctly implemented.

4. **Serval Arrives After All Buses:**
   - If all buses have their first arrival time after `t`, the program will correctly select the first one based on the wait time calculations.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description and handles all potential edge cases. There are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem.

Correctness: **True**.
