Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer.

The line of code assigns the current value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is already defined based on the conditions provided for bus arrival times, `min_wait_time` will take on that value. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time`.**
