Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is either 0 or a non-negative integer calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, depending on whether `(t - s_i) % d_i` is 0 or not. `min_wait_time` remains a non-negative integer, and `chosen_route` is set to `n + 1`, with `s_i` and `d_i` assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating no wait is needed; otherwise, `wait_time` reflects the time remaining until the next bus arrives, ensuring it is non-negative.***
