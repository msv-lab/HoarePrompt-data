According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop runs for `i` from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its maximum value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is beyond the range of the loop. Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to `n`, and since the loop will not execute again, no other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is set to `n + 1`**
