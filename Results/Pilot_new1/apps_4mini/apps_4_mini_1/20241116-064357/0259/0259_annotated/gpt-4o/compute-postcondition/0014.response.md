The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, this assignment will update `min_wait_time` to a finite value instead of positive infinity. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is less than the new `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is less than the new `min_wait_time`.**
