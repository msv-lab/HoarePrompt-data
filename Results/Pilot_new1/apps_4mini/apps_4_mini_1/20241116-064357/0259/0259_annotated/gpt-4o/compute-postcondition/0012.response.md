Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that `wait_time` remains a non-negative integer that represents the time until the next bus departure. This accounts for all possible scenarios regarding the relationship between `s_i` and `t`, including edge cases where `s_i` equals `t` or where `s_i` is just slightly less than `t` but still leads to a valid wait time calculation.***
