Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `wait_time` is a non-negative integer. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the selection of a new bus route with a shorter wait time. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that the chosen route always corresponds to the minimum wait time encountered.***
