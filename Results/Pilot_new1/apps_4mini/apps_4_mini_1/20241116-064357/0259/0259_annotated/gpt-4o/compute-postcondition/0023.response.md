Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer. If `s_i` (the start time of the bus) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`, indicating the wait time until the bus arrives. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, meaning the bus is arriving at the current time. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring that it accounts for the next bus arrival time and remains non-negative. This covers all scenarios for waiting time based on the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.***
