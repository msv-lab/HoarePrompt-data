The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are derived from their respective states, where `s_i` is taken from the `bus_routes` list at index `n`, and `t` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `s_i` will have a corresponding value from `bus_routes`. The exact value of `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`.

Therefore, the output state is:
`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `wait_time` is assigned the value `s_i - t**
