To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program and the values of the affected variables.

1. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`.
2. The variable `t` is a given positive integer.
3. The expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, which means that the wait time calculation will proceed.
4. The wait time is calculated using the formula `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

Since we do not have the specific values for `s_i` and `d_i`, we can state the relationship in terms of these variables:

- `wait_time` is calculated based on `d_i` and the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`.
- The values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are not affected by this calculation, and remain as initialized.

Thus, the output state will reflect the calculated `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i`, while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
