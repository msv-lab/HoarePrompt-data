Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes`, where each tuple contains the start time and the interval of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses and returns the index (1-indexed) of the bus route that offers this minimum wait time. If no routes are available (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1. If all bus routes have start times before `t`, it calculates the wait time based on the next available bus; if no suitable bus is found, it will still return the index of the first bus route with the minimum wait time calculated.**
