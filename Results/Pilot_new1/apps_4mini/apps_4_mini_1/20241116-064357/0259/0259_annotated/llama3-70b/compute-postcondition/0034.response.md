The function `func` does not explicitly take any parameters as input. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100000, and for each bus route, `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 100000. The function processes this information and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships. 

Since the output or specific return value is not provided in the prompt, we can only state that the function is designed to work with these parameters and constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but operates under the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and for each bus route, s_i and d_i are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000). The function returns a result based on these inputs and constraints.**
