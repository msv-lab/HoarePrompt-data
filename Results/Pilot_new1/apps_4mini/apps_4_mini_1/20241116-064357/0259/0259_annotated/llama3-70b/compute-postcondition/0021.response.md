According to the code, the loop iterates over the `buses` list using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the tuple `(s, d)` for each bus. Since `i` is currently 0 and `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, the loop has executed for the first bus. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` must be incremented to 1, and the current tuple `(s, d)` must be updated to the second tuple in the list. Given that `buses` has at least 1 tuple, it is safe to assume that there is a second tuple available.

Thus, we need to adjust the state as follows:
- Update `i` to 1.
- Update `(s, d)` to the second tuple in `buses`.

State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples where `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `(s, d)` is the second tuple in `buses`.**
