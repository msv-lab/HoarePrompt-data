According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute `n` times, and the loop variable `_` will increment with each iteration starting from 0. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, indicating that the loop has executed once. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- The value of `_` must be less than `n`. Since `_` is currently 0, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `_` is currently 0, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop should execute again. Therefore, we can set `_` to 1 to indicate that the loop has executed once and will now execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), `_` is 1**
