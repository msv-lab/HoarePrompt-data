Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples where `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`. If `time`, calculated as `(t - s) % d`, is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 1. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
