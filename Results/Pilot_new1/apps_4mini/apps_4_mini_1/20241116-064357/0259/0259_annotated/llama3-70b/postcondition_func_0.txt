The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads two integers `n` (the number of buses) and `t` (the current time) from input. It then reads `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` for each bus. The function calculates the minimum time until the next bus arrives based on the formula `(t - s) % d` and returns the 1-based index of the bus that provides this minimum wait time. If no buses are provided (which is not allowed by the constraints since `n` is always at least 1), it would return `-1`. The function prints the index of the bus with the minimum wait time. If all buses have a start time greater than `t`, it will still compute and return the bus with the minimum wait time based on the given logic.
