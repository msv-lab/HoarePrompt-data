Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples where `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `(s, d)` is the second tuple in `buses`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
