The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input and splitting it into two integers. The variables `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s` and `d`, which are derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` and `d` are input integers**.
