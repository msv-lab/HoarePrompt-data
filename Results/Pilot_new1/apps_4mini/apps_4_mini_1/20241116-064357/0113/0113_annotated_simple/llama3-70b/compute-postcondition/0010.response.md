The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it is implied that it operates on two variables: `n`, which is a positive integer satisfying the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k`, which is a non-negative integer satisfying the constraint \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the given constraints alone.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 8), but the specific output and behavior are not defined.**
