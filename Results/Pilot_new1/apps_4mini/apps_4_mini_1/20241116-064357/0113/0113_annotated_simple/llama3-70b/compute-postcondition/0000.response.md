The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from `input()` after being converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The specific values for `n` and `k` are provided as input, but since they are not given in the initial state, we can only describe them based on the constraints. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
