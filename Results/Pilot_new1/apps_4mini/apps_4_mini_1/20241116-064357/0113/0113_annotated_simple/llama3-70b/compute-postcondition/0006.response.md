The value of `n` is incremented by 1, which means `n` will now be `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 2; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`; `n % x != 0`; and `n` is now `n + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 2; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`; `n % x != 0`; and `n` is now `n + 1`**
