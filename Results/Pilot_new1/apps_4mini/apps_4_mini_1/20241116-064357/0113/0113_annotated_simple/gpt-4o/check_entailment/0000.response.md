To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which is calculated as n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
```

### Logic Breakdown
1. **Multiplier Calculation**: The code calculates `multiplier` as `10 ** k`, which represents the smallest number that ends with `k` zeros. This is correct as it gives us the base number we need to ensure the result ends with `k` zeros.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `multiplier`. This is used to adjust `n` so that the resulting product is divisible by `n` and also ends with at least `k` zeros.

3. **Final Calculation**: The final value `x` is computed as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. This ensures that `x` is the smallest integer that meets both conditions: being divisible by `n` and ending with at least `k` zeros.

### Edge Cases
- **k = 0**: The program should return `n` since any number `n` is divisible by itself and ends with 0 zeros.
- **k = 1**: The program should return `n` if `n` ends with at least one zero; otherwise, it should find the nearest multiple of `10`.
- **k = 8**: The program should handle large values correctly, ensuring that the output does not exceed the limits of Python's integers.

### Example Tests
1. **Input**: `375 4`
   - `multiplier = 10 ** 4 = 10000`
   - `gcd(375, 10000) = 125`
   - `x = 375 * (10000 // 125) = 375 * 80 = 30000` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `10000 1`
   - `multiplier = 10 ** 1 = 10`
   - `gcd(10000, 10) = 10`
   - `x = 10000 * (10 // 10) = 10000 * 1 = 10000` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `38101 0`
   - `multiplier = 10 ** 0 = 1`
   - `gcd(38101, 1) = 1`
   - `x = 38101 * (1 // 1) = 38101` (Correct)

4. **Input**: `123456789 8`
   - `multiplier = 10 ** 8 = 100000000`
   - `gcd(123456789, 100000000) = 1`
   - `x = 123456789 * (100000000 // 1) = 12345678900000000` (Correct)

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic required to compute the k-rounding of `n` as described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and returns the expected results for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
