The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `k`, which is a non-negative integer. It calculates a `multiplier` as \(10^k\) and then computes the value of `x` using the formula \(n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{math.gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right)\). This effectively scales `n` by the least common multiple of `n` and `multiplier`. The function returns this computed value of `x`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as \(10^k\), and returns the value of `x` computed as \(n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right) \). **
