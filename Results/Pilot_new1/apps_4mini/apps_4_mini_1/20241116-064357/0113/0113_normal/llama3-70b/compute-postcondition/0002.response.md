The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and since `n` is an input positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, after the increment, `n` will be in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 1. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is in the range 2 to 10^9 + 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is 10^k.

Output State: **`n` is in the range 2 to 10^9 + 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, and `x` is 10^k**
