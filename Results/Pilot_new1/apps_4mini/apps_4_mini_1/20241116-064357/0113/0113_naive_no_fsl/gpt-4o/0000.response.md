To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented and see if it meets the requirements of the problem statement for all possible inputs.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the minimum positive integer \( x \) such that:
  1. \( x \) is divisible by \( n \).
  2. \( x \) ends with \( k \) or more zeros in base 10.

### Analysis of the Program:
The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` which computes the k-rounding of \( n \):
1. It calculates `multiplier` as \( 10^k \).
2. It computes \( x \) as \( n \times \left(\frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})}\right) \).

### Steps to Verify:
1. **Understanding the logic**:
   - The expression \( \frac{\text{multiplier}}{\text{gcd}(n, \text{multiplier})} \) effectively finds the smallest multiplier that ensures \( x \) is divisible by \( n \) and has at least \( k \) trailing zeros.
   - This works because multiplying \( n \) by this factor ensures that \( x \) is the least common multiple of \( n \) and the required number of trailing zeros.

2. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n = 1, k = 0 \)
     - Expected output: \( 1 \) (since \( 1 \) has 0 trailing zeros and is divisible by \( 1 \)).
     - The program returns \( 1 \) (correct).
   - **Case 2**: \( n = 10, k = 1 \)
     - Expected output: \( 10 \) (since \( 10 \) has 1 trailing zero and is divisible by \( 10 \)).
     - The program returns \( 10 \) (correct).
   - **Case 3**: \( n = 375, k = 4 \)
     - Expected output: \( 30000 \) (as given in the example).
     - The program returns \( 30000 \) (correct).
   - **Case 4**: \( n = 38101, k = 0 \)
     - Expected output: \( 38101 \) (as given in the example).
     - The program returns \( 38101 \) (correct).
   - **Case 5**: \( n = 123456789, k = 8 \)
     - Expected output: \( 12345678900000000 \) (as given in the example).
     - The program returns \( 12345678900000000 \) (correct).

### Conclusion:
After testing these cases, the program seems to handle all specified conditions correctly. The logic used in the program correctly computes the k-rounding of \( n \) for all tested inputs, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
