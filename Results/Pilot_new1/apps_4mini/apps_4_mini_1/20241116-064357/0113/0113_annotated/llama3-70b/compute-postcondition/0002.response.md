The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the new value of `n` will be between 2 and 10^9 + 1. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 1; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of k.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 + 1; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of k**
