The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). The function's output is determined by these constraints, but since no specific output behavior is provided, we cannot detail the return values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate within the given constraints for `n` and `k`, but without further information on its output, we cannot specify what it returns.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). The specific output behavior is not defined.**
