The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8, the possible values for `x` will be `1` (when `k` is `0`), `10` (when `k` is `1`), `100` (when `k` is `2`), `1000` (when `k` is `3`), `10000` (when `k` is `4`), `100000` (when `k` is `5`), `1000000` (when `k` is `6`), `10000000` (when `k` is `7`), and `100000000` (when `k` is `8`). The values of `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of k.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is 10 raised to the power of k**
