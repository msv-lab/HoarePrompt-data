The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as \(10^k\), and returns the value of \(x\), which is computed as \(n \times \left(\frac{10^k}{\text{math.gcd}(n, 10^k)}\right)\). It does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected results in practical use.
