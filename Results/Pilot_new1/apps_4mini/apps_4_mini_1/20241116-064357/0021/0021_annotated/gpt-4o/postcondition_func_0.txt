The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers `1` and `n` to the start and end of the list, and prints this maximum distance. It does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, which may result in an error.
