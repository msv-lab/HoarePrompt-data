The function `func` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list `a` to the start (index 0) and end (index n-1) of the list. The function does not handle cases where `1` or `n` may not be present in the list, which could lead to a `ValueError`. The functionality of the function is to compute and print the maximum distance from either end of the list to the positions of the integers `1` and `n`, assuming both are present in the list. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers `1` and `n` to the start and end of the list, and prints this maximum distance. It does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, which may result in an error. **
