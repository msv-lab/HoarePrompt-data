The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers, and since `1` is included in the list, `pos1` will hold the index where `1` is located. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a**
