To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to compare its functionality against the problem description and the provided examples. 

### Analyzing the Problem Description:
1. **Objective**: Nicholas wants to maximize the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap.
2. **Input**: 
   - An integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100).
   - A list of n distinct integers which is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
3. **Output**: A single integer representing the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. The program reads an integer n and a list of n distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates the maximum distance between these positions after performing a swap:
   - `max_dist` calculates the maximum distance possible by considering the absolute difference between the positions of 1 and n, adjusted by 1.
   - `min_dist` is similarly calculated but looks for the minimum distance.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_dist` and a calculation involving `min_dist`.

### Code Annotations:
- The annotations state that the function assumes both 1 and n are present in the list and does not handle cases where they are missing.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Assumption of Presence**: The code does not handle cases where either 1 or n is missing from the list. Since the problem guarantees that the input is a valid permutation of numbers from 1 to n, this may not be an issue in practice, but it is a flaw in terms of robustness.
2. **Calculation Logic**: The calculation of the maximum distance seems to focus on the positions of 1 and n. However, it does not explicitly consider that the swap should be used to maximize the distance. For example, if 1 is at index 0 and n is at index 1, the distance is already minimal and the code may not produce the expected output.

### Edge Cases:
- If the permutation is already in a configuration where the distance between 1 and n is maximized (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] where n=5), the program may not account for the necessity of a swap that does not change the distance.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis of the code and the potential issues identified, particularly the lack of handling for edge cases and the assumption about the presence of 1 and n, the program does not meet the correctness criteria for every potential case outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not correctly account for situations where the maximum distance cannot be achieved with a single swap, nor does it handle cases where 1 or n might be absent, which could lead to incorrect outputs.
