To determine the output state, we analyze the code provided.

1. `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.
2. `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.
3. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn)` calculates the absolute difference between the indices of `1` and `n`.
4. The expression `n - 2` is a constant value based on the input integer `n`.
5. The `max` function takes the maximum of the two values: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. 

The output state will include the values of `n`, `pos1`, `posn`, and the calculated `max_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`**
