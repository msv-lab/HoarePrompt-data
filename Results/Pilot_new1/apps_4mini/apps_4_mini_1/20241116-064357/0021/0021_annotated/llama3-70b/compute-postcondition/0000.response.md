The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous conditions state that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the other variable `a` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n.**
