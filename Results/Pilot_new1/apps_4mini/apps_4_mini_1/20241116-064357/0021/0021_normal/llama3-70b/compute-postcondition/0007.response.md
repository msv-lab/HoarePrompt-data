The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and generates an output based on them. 

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, and then perform operations that yield a specific output based on the values in the list and their relationship to `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
