The code assigns `posn` the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the first occurrence of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, it is assumed that `n` exists in the list `a`. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (an input integer), `a` (a list of integers), and `pos1` (the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, which is not directly affected by this operation). Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `posn` based on the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of integers based on input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
