To evaluate the code snippet provided, we need to consider the variables involved:

1. `n` is an input integer ranging from 2 to 100.
2. `a` is a list of integers based on input.
3. `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`.
4. `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

The code calculates `max_dist` as follows:
- It computes the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracts `1`, and then takes the maximum of that value and `n - 2`.

Given that `pos1` and `posn` are indices, the values of `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2` will determine the value of `max_dist`.

Since we do not have specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, or `n`, we can state the possible outcomes based on the range of `n` and the potential values of `pos1` and `posn`. 

The output state would reflect that `max_dist` is calculated based on the provided values of `n`, `pos1`, and `posn`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of integers based on input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
