The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, where the input is split into separate strings, converted to integers, and then collected into a list. The previous state of `a` is that it was a list of `n` distinct integers, but now it will be updated based on the new input. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but `a` will now hold the integers provided in the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of integers based on input**.
