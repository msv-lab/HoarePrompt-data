Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list `a`, then computes the maximum and minimum distances based on their positions and the length of the list. Finally, it prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. However, the function does not handle cases where `1` or `n` might not be present in the list `a`, which could lead to a `ValueError` when calling `index`.**
