The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `n` are constrained such that `2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100`, and the values of `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n, and `n` is an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n; `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100**
