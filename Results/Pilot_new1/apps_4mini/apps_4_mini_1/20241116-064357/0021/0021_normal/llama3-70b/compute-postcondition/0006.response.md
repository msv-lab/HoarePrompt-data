To determine the output state, let's analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. The code calculates `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.
2. `max_dist` is already calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
3. `min_dist` is already calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
4. The expression `n - 1 - min_dist` is evaluated.

Since the exact values of `pos1`, `posn`, `max_dist`, and `min_dist` are based on the input list `a` and the input integer `n`, we cannot determine their exact values without that context. However, we can express the output state based on the calculations performed.

The output state will summarize that `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already defined, and the final result printed is based on those values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100; `a` is a list of integers based on input; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the result printed is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**.
