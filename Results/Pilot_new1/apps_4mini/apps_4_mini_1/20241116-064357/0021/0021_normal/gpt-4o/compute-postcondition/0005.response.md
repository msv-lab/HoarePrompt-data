The value of `dist2` is assigned the result of the expression `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The values of `n`, `max_pos`, and `dist1` are not changed, but `dist2` is calculated based on the current values of `n` and `max_pos`. 

Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist2` will be a non-negative integer that represents the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos)**
