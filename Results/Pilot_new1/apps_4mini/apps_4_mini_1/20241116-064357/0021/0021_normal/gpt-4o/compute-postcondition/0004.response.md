The variable `max_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The code calculates `dist1` as the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is an index, `dist1` will be equal to `max_pos`. The state of the other variables is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.**
