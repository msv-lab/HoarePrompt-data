To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we analyze the impact of the assignment of `dist4`.

1. **Variables Involved:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `dist4` is calculated as `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `dist4` is assigned the result of the expression `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.
   - The values of `n` and `min_pos` are used directly in the calculation of `dist4`.

3. **Output State:**
   - Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `min_pos`, we can only describe the relationship.
   - `dist4` is determined based on the values of `n` and `min_pos`.

Thus, the output state reflecting the current values and the calculation performed is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of the minimum value in `a`; `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**.
