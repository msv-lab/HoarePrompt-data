The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer constrained to the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to n. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so I cannot describe the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n).**
