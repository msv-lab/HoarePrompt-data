To determine the output state, we analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Initial Values**: We have `n` as an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` as a list of `n` distinct integers, `posn` as the index of `n` in the list `a`, `max_dist` is calculated as the maximum of `(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1)` and `(n - 2)`, and `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

2. **Output Calculation**: The code snippet `print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))` evaluates the maximum between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

3. **Variables Impact**:
   - `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already calculated based on the values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.
   - The `print` statement does not affect the values of any variables but outputs the result of the maximum calculation.

Since the exact values of `max_dist`, `min_dist`, and the input integers are not specified, we can summarize the output state based on the operations performed and the relationships between the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (n - 2); `min_dist` is determined by min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the result of max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist) is printed.**
