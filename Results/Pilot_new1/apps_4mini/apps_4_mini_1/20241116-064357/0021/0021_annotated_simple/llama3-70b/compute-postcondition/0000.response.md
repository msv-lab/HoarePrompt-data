The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is specified to be an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, the output state reflects that `n` is now the input integer. The variable `a` is not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing a permutation of size n**
