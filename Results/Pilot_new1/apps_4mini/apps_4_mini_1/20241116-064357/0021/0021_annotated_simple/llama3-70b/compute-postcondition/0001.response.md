The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The previous state indicates that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `a` is initially an empty list. After executing the code, `a` will contain `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers**
