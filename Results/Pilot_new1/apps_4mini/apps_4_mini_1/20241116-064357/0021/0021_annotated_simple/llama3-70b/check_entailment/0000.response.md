To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem.

### Code Analysis
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pos1 = a.index(1)
    posn = a.index(n)
    max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
    min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
    print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Inputs**: The program takes an integer `n` (size of the permutation) and an array `a` of size `n` containing distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. **Goal**: The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after performing exactly one swap.

### Key Points of the Code
- The program uses `a.index(1)` to find the position of the minimum element (1).
- It uses `a.index(n)` to find the position of the maximum element (n).
- It calculates the maximum distance after a swap using the formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
- It also calculates a minimum distance using `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which is not necessary for the final output.
- Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The way `max_dist` and `min_dist` are calculated is flawed. The goal is to simply swap the positions of `1` and `n` to maximize their distance. The distance should be calculated as `n - 1` (the maximum possible distance in a zero-indexed array).
2. **Output Logic**: The output logic does not correctly reflect the maximum distance after a single swap. The program does not ensure that the swap is performed to achieve the maximum distance.

### Example to Test
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Here, `pos1` would be `0` (position of `1`) and `posn` would be `4` (position of `5`).
- The distance before any swap is `4`. If we swap `1` and `5`, the distance remains `4`. This is already the maximum distance.
- The expected output is `4`, but the program will not output correctly due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly compute the maximum possible distance after performing exactly one swap, as it miscalculates the distances and does not account for the straightforward swap of `1` and `n`.

Correctness: **False**
