The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing values from 1 to n. The function does not return any specific output described in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct integers, ensuring that the constraints on `n` and `a` are met. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers containing values from 1 to n.**
