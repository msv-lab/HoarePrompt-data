The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its string representation for numbers between 0 and 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. For numbers between 10 and 99, it returns the tens place representation from the `tens` list, and if `n` is not a multiple of 10, it concatenates the tens and ones representations with a hyphen. The function does not return any value for numbers less than 0 or greater than 99, which is a potential edge case not handled in the annotations.
