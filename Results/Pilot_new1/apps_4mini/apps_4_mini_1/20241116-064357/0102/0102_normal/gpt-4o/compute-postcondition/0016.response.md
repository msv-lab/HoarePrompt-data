Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from 'zero' to 'nine', `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from 'eleven' to 'nineteen', and `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 0 or `n` is greater than 9. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation from the `teens` list corresponding to `n - 10`. If `n` is between 10 and 99, and `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. If `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not execute the if statement and thus does not return any value.***
