Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the `teens` list corresponding to `n - 10`. If `n` is between 10 and 99, if `n` is a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. If `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value.***
