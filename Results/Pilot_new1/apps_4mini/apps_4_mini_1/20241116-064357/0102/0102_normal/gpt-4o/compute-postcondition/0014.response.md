Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from 'zero' to 'nine', `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from 'eleven' to 'nineteen', and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place, `tens[n // 10]`. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`, covering all integers from 10 to 99.***
