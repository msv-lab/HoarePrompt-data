Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input from the user and prints its English word representation for numbers from 0 to 99. It handles numbers less than 10 by referencing the `ones` list, numbers from 10 to 19 using the `teens` list, and numbers 20 and above by combining the appropriate elements from the `tens` and `ones` lists, separated by a hyphen if applicable. However, it does not handle negative integers or numbers greater than 99, which are edge cases that are not addressed in the implementation. **
