Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 0 or greater than 9. If `n` is between 11 and 19, the function returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, and `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]'. For values of `n` less than 10 or greater than 19, the function does not return any value, leaving those cases undefined.***
