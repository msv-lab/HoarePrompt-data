The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation for values between 0 and 99. It returns 'zero' for 0, 'one' to 'nine' for 1 to 9, 'eleven' to 'nineteen' for 11 to 19, and for numbers from 10 to 99, it returns the tens place followed by the ones place if applicable (e.g., 'twenty-one' for 21). However, the function does not handle values less than 0 or greater than 99, leaving those cases undefined.
