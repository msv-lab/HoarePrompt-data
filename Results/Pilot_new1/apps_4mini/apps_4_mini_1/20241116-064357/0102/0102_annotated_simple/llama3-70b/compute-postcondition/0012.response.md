Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the output is `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output corresponds to `teens[s - 10]`. For values of `s` from 20 to 99, the printed value is the string representation of `s` in words, formatted as 'tens' followed by 'ones' if `s` is not a multiple of 10. Thus, all integers from 0 to 99 are correctly converted to their English word equivalents.***
