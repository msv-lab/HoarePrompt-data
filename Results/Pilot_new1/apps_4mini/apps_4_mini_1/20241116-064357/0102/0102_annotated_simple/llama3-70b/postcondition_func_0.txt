The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `s` from the user. It converts the integer `s`, which must be between 0 and 99, into its English word equivalent and prints it. The function handles numbers less than 10 using a predefined list for single-digit numbers, numbers from 10 to 19 using a list for teens, and numbers from 20 to 99 by combining the appropriate entries from the tens and ones lists. However, if the input is negative or greater than 99, the function does not handle these cases and will result in an index error or unexpected behavior.
