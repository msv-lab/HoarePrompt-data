The code prints the string representation of the integer `s` based on its value. The variable `s` is an integer such that 20 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. The `tens` list provides the names for the tens place, and the `ones` list provides the names for the units place.

The value of `s // 10` gives the index for the `tens` list, while `s % 10` gives the index for the `ones` list. If `s` is a multiple of 10, `s % 10` will be 0, and the output will not include the `ones` part.

For example:
- If `s` is 20, the output will be `tens[2]` which is "twenty", and since `s % 10` is 0, it will not add anything from `ones`.
- If `s` is 25, the output will be `tens[2]` which is "twenty", and since `s % 10` is 5, it will add `'-' + ones[5]` which is "-five". Therefore, the output will be "twenty-five".

The output state will reflect the specific string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer between 20 and 99; the output is the string representation of `s` in words.**
