Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 0 and 9, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99, and `s` is a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation from the `tens` list. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation in the format `tens[s // 10] + '-' + ones[s % 10]`. Cases where `s` is exactly 10 or where `s` is less than 0 or greater than 19 are not handled within this fragment.***
