The function accepts an integer `n`, which is expected to be in the range of 0 to 99, and returns its English string representation. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, it returns the string representation based on the tens and ones places. However, the function does not handle the case where `n` is exactly 10, nor does it handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
