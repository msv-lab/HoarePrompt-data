Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place corresponding to `n`, which is `tens[n // 10]`. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`, effectively capturing both the tens and ones places in the output.***
