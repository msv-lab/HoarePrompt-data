The variable `results` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables, `data`, `T`, and `index`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `results` without altering the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
