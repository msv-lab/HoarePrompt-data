The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment, and since `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, and `balance` is not equal to 0, those states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0**
