Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`, and `count` is at least 2, then if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being at least 3. If the conditions for the if statement are not met, `count` remains unchanged and is still at least 2.***
