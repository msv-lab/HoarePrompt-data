The code appends `0` to the `results` list. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balances, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. The appending operation does not affect the values of `n`, `prefix_balances`, or `balance`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `balance` is 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include 0**
