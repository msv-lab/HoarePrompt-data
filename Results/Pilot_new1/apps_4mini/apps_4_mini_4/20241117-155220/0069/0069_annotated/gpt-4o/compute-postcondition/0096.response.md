The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables and indicates that `-1` has been added to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative differences for the first `n` characters of `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
