The `results` list is updated by appending the value `0`. The previous state of `results` contains `-1`, so after executing the code, `results` will now contain `-1` followed by `0`. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums of '0's and '1's up to index `n`, `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is assigned a value that is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1 and 0, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `index` is increased by 3.
