Postcondition: ***If `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the count of valid indices in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` for each `b` in `prefix_balances`. In all cases, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros if `n` is 0 or lower, and the loop does not execute.***
