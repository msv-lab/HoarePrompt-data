Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums of '0's and '1's up to index `n`, `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is an integer assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, then `results` will contain at least three elements, including two `-1`s and one additional `-1` appended from this condition. If `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, then `results` will contain at least two elements, including one `-1` and one `0`. In both cases, `T` remains greater than the current iteration count, and `index` is increased by 3. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros.***
