The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The initial state indicates that `index` is 1, so `index + 1` equals 2. Therefore, `x` will be assigned the integer value of `data[2]`. The previous values of the affected variables are `data` (a list of strings), `T` (greater than 0), `index` (1), `results` (an empty list), and `n` (the integer value of `data[1]`). The output state reflects that `x` is now assigned the integer value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, and `x` is the integer value of `data[2]**
