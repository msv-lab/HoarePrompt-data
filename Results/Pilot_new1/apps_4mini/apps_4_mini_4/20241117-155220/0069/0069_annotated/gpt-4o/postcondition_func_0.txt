The function accepts multiple test cases from standard input, each containing a binary string and a target value. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string, and based on this balance, it determines how many ways the target value can be achieved using the prefix sums of the string. If the balance is zero and the target value is found in the prefix sums, it returns -1; if not found, it returns 0. If the balance is non-zero, it counts valid indices in the prefix sums that satisfy specific conditions with respect to the target value and balance. The function may encounter an index out of bounds error if the input data does not contain enough elements to process all test cases.
