Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the output is -1, indicating that the expression `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is undefined or not applicable. Otherwise, the output is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, providing the result based on the division of the adjusted value by the difference in counts of '0's and '1's.***
