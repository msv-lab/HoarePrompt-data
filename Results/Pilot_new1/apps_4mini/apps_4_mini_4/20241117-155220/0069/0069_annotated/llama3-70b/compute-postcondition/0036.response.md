Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the output is -1, indicating that no adjustments can be made to reach the desired balance. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
