The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `x` using the `map` function, which takes input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts them into integers. The initial state indicates that `T` is a positive integer, but it does not affect the assignment of `n` and `x`. The values of `n` and `x` will be determined by the user's input. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n` and `x` based on user input.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers**
