Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T + 1 <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the second condition is not evaluated, and the output will not be -1, but if `cnt0 - cnt1` is not zero and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
