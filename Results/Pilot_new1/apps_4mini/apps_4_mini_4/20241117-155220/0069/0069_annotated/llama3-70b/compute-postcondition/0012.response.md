Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` and `x` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is not equal to `x`, and either `cnt0 - cnt1` is equal to 0 or `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0`; the output of the print statement is calculated as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.**
