Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T + 1 <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.**
