The `print` function outputs the value of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is an input integer, but the specific value is not provided in the initial state. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `n + 1`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints `n + 1`.**
