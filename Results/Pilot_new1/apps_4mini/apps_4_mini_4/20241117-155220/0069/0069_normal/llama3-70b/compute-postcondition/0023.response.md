Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1, indicating that the expression is exactly divisible by the difference in counts. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which provides the quotient of the adjusted value divided by the difference in counts, incremented by one. This handles the cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` (leading to division by zero) and ensures that the output reflects the conditions of `x` and the balance of counts.***
