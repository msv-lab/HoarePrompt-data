Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `balance` is not equal to `x`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the number of complete cycles needed to reach the balance condition. This covers all scenarios where `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, ensuring that the calculations handle both the case where the output is -1 and where it computes the resulting value correctly.***
