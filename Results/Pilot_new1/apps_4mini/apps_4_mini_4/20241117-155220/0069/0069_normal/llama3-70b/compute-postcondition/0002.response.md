The code assigns values to `n` and `x` by taking input and splitting it into two integer values. The variable `T` remains unchanged. Since `n` and `x` will be determined by user input, the output state reflects that `n` and `x` are now assigned values based on the input. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
