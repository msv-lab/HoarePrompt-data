Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 99), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1), which is calculated based on the values of `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`. This includes handling the case where `cnt0` is greater than `cnt1` and the case where `cnt1` is greater than `cnt0`.***
