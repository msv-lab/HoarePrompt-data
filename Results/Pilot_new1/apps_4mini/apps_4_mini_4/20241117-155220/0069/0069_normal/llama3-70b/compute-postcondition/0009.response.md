Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`.***
