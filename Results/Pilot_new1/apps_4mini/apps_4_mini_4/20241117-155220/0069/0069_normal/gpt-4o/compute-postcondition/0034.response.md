Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`, and `count` is initially 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 2. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 1.***
