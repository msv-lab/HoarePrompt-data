The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it will now point to a new position in the data structure. The other variables `balance`, `x`, `results`, `T`, `current_iteration`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `index` while retaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`balance` is 0, `x` is int(data[index + 1]), `results` reflects the last appended value, `T` is greater than `current_iteration`, `n` is int(data[index]), `s` is data[index + 2], and `index` is incremented by 3**
