Output State: **If n is at least 1, then `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative balance calculated from the string `s`, where each character contributes either +1 (if '0') or -1 (if '1'). After the loop executes, `prefix_balances[i]` will be the sum of the contributions from `s[0]` to `s[i-1]`. If n is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of size 1 initialized to all zeros.**
