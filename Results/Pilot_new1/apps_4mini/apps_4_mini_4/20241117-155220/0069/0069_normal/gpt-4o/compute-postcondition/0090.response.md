According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `n` is at least 2, it does not need to be adjusted. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 3, reflecting the next iteration.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`**
