According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 3 elements, and the function prints the value of `result`, which is the third element in the list. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 elements, and `result` should be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` has at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in the list**
