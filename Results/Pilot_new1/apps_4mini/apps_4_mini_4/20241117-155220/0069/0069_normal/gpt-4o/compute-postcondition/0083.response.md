The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, but it is increased by 3. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than the current iteration count; `n` is the integer value retrieved from `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `s` is the value from `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3.

Output State: **`T` is greater than the current iteration count; `n` is the integer value retrieved from `data[index]`; `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]; `s` is the value from `data[index + 2]; `index` is increased by 3.**
