The value of `index` is incremented by 3, but the previous value of `index` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is the integer value derived from `data[1]`, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]**
