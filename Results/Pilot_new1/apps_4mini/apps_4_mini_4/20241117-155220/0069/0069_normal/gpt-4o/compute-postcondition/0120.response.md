According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least one element. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and `result` must be the second element in the list. 

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` has at least 2 elements, result is the second element in the list**
