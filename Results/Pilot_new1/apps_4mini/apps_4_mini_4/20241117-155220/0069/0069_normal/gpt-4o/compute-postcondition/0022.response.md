The code appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The initial state indicates that `results` is a list that exists prior to this operation, but its current contents are not specified. The values of `n`, `prefix_balances`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition of `-1` to the `results` list.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `-1` has been appended to `results`.**
