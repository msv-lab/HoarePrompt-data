According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Additionally, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 2, and since `n` is already greater than or equal to 1, it should be adjusted to ensure it is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` initialized to all zeros, and `prefix_balances[1]` is updated to `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`**
