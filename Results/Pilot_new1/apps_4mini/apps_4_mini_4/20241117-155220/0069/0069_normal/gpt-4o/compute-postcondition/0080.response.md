The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` retrieves a value from the `data` list at the specified `index`, and `int` converts that value to an integer. The state of other variables is not affected in this statement. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `n` is the integer value retrieved from `data[index]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than the current iteration count; `n` is the integer value retrieved from `data[index]`**
