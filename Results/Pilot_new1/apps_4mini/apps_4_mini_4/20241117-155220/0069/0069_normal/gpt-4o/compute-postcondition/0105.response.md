Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums with at least 1 element, `b` is 0, `n` is less than 1, `T` is greater than 0, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
