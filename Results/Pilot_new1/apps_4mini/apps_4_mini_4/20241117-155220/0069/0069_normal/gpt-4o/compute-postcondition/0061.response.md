The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The previous values of `results` are not specified, but since `results` is being modified, we note that it will now include the value `0`. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to 0, and `results` now includes the value 0.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to 0, and `results` now includes the value 0**
