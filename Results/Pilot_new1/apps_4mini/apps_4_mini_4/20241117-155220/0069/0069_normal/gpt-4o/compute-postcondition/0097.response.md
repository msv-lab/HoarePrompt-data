Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums calculated based on the string `s`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the number of '0's minus the number of '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`. The variable `balance` is equal to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times, and `T` remains greater than 0 throughout the execution. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 initialized to all zeros. Additionally, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`.***
