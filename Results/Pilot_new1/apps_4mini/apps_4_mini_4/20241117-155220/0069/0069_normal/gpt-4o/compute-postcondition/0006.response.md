The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of substrings derived from the input and `index` is 1. The value of `data[index]` corresponds to the second element of the list, and `int` converts that substring to an integer. The value of `T`, `results`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer value derived from `data[1]`, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
