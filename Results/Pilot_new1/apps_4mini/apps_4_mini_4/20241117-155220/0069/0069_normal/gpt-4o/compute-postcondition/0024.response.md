The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state does not provide any information about the previous values or state of `results`, but it indicates that the balance remains equal to `0`. The appending operation does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance, and `results` now includes an additional element `0`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance, and `results` now includes an additional element 0**
