Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[n]` equals 0, indicating a balanced cumulative balance of '0's and '1's. If `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, 0 is appended to `results`. This covers cases where `n` is positive, zero, or negative, ensuring that the function handles the balance correctly for all specified conditions.***
