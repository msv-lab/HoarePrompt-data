Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the desired balance `x` is equal to the balance of the string `s` and the count of prefixes with balance `x` is infinite. 

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1 0
01
```
In this case:
- `n = 2`, `x = 0`, and `s = "01"`.
- The balance of `s` is `cnt_0 - cnt_1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.

The program will check if `x` (which is `0`) is in the `prefix_balances`. The `prefix_balances` for `s` will be `[0, -1, 0]`. Since `0` is present, the program will return `-1`, indicating an infinite number of prefixes. 

However, this is incorrect because there are only two prefixes of `t` (the infinite concatenation of `s`) with balance `0`: the empty prefix and the prefix formed by the entire string `s` repeated an even number of times (which is infinite). 

The program should return `-1` only if there are indeed infinite valid prefixes, but it fails to correctly account for the fact that there are other prefixes that do not reach the balance `0` when `s` is concatenated infinitely.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
