The variable `balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The initial state already defines `cnt0` as the count of '0's in `s` and `cnt1` as the count of '1's in `s`. Therefore, `balance` will be calculated based on the current values of `cnt0` and `cnt1`. The output state reflects the updated value of `balance`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`**
