Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the function will also print -1 since the denominator becomes zero in the else statement. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is a value derived from the calculation involving `x` and `balance`.***
