The values of `n` and `x` are assigned from the input, which is split and converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are overwritten by the input values. The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `n` and `x` based on the input.

Output State: **`T` is at least 1, `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length n**
