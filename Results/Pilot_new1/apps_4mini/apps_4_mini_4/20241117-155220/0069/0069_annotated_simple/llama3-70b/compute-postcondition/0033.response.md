Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1, indicating that `x - balance` is exactly divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`. Otherwise, the function prints the integer result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which represents the quotient of the division plus one. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, it should be noted that the division would not be valid, and special handling may be required in such a case.***
