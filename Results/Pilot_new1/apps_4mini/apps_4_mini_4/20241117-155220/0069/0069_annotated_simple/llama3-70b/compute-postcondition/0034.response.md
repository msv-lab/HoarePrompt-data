Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program prints -1, indicating that `x - balance` is exactly divisible by `cnt0 - cnt1`. Otherwise, it prints the integer result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special handling is required as the division would not be valid.***
