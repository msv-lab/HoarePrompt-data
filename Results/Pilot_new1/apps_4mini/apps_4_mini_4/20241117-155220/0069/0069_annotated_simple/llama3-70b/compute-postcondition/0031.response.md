The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the existing values of `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`. 

Output State: **`cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the function prints -1**
