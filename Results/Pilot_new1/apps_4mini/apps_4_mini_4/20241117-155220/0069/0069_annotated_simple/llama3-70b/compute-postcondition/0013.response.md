Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This handles the case where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, as the precondition ensures that `balance` is not equal to `x`, thus avoiding division by zero.***
