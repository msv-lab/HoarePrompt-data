Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x` and the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` is handled by the precondition that `balance` is not equal to `x`, thus avoiding division by zero.***
