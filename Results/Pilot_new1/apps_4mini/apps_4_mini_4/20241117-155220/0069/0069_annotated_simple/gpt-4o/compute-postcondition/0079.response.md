According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `T`. For the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than the current iteration count. Since the state at the end of the previous iteration does not provide a specific value for `T`, we can only infer that it must be adjusted to be greater than the current iteration count.

Assuming the loop has executed `t` times already, we need to ensure that `T` is adjusted to be greater than `t`. Since there are no other states provided that need to be adjusted, we only need to focus on `T`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is 0, T is greater than t**
