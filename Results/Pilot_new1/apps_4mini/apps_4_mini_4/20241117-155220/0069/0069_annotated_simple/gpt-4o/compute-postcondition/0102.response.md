According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute if there is at least one element in `prefix_balances`. Given that the final value of `balance` is not equal to 0, it implies that there is at least one cumulative balance present, meaning `prefix_balances` should contain at least one value.

Since `n` indicates the number of times the loop has executed, if the loop is to execute now, `n` should be 0, as it has not executed yet. The variable `b` will take the value of the first element in `prefix_balances` during the first iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `prefix_balances` contains at least one element, `n` is 0, and `b` is equal to the first element of `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `n` is 0, `b` is the first element of `prefix_balances`**
