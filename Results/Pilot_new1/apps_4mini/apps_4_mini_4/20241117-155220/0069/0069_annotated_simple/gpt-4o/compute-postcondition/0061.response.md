The `results` list is appended with the value `0`. The `prefix_balances` and `balance` variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `results` now includes an additional element, which is `0`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is 0, and `results` includes an additional element 0**.
