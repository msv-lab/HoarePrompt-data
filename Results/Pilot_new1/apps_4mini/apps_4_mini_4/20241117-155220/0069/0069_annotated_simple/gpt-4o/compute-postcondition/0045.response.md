The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, which means `s` now holds the value from the `data` list at the position `index + 2`. The values of `prefix_balances`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]**
