The code appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state mentions that `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance, but it does not affect the operation of appending to `results`. The variable `x` being not an element of `prefix_balances` also does not impact the appending operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the addition to the `results` list without changing other variables.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, the balance is equal to 0, `x` is not an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include 0.**
