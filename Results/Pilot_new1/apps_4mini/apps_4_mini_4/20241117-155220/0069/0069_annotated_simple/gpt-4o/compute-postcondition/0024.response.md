Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0; `balance` is 0; `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`; the loop has executed `n` times with `i` ranging from 1 to `n`; and `results` now includes an additional element 0.**
