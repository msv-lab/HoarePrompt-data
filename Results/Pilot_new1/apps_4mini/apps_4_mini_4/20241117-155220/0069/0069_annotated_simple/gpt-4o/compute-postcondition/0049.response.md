According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n + 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` starts at 1 for the first iteration. 

Since `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, it is initialized correctly regardless of the value of `n` (as long as `n` is non-negative). 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is now 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all elements as 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
