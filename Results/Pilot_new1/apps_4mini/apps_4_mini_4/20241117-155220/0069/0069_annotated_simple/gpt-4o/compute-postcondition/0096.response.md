The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. The values of `prefix_balances` and `x` are not affected by this operation, as it only modifies the `results` list. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `prefix_balances` and `x`, along with the updated `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's from the string `s`, the balance is equal to 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` has `-1` appended to it.**
