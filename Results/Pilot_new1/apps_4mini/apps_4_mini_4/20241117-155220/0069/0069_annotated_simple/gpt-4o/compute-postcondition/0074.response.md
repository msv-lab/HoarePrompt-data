Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 2, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
