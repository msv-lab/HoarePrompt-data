Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute `n` times, and `i` will range from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.**
