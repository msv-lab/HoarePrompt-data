According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in the `prefix_balances` list. For the loop to execute, `prefix_balances` must contain at least one element. Given that `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, it will have at least one element as long as `n` is at least 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `count` is 0, which is the initial value and does not affect the loop execution. The loop variable `b` will take on the values of each element in the `prefix_balances` list during each iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 0 (which it is, since the list has length `n + 1`). The initial state of `b` can be set to the first element of `prefix_balances`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`**
