The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` represents an input that is converted to an integer. The value of `n` will affect the length of the `prefix_balances` list, but the previous values of the affected variables are not specified. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `n`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `balance` is 0, `T` is greater than `t`, and `n` is an input integer**
