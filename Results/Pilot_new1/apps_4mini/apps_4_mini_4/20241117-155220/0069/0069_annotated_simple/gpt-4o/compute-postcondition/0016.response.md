According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, which is `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `2`. 

Since the loop is defined to run from `1` to `n + 1`, we also need to ensure that `n` is at least `1` to allow for another iteration. 

Thus, to allow the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `2`. The state of `prefix_balances[2]` does not need to be modified since it is already defined based on the previous iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[2]` is updated based on `s[1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 1**
