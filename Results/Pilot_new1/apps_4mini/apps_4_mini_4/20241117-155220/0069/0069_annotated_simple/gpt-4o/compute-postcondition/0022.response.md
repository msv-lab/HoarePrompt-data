The `results` list is modified by appending `-1` to it. The other variables, including `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `x`, and `n`, are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change to the `results` list.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, with `prefix_balances[0]` initialized to 0; `balance` is 0; `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`; `n` is at least 1; and `results` has `-1` appended to it.**
