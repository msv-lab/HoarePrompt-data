The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer with a constraint of 1 <= T <= 100.
- `n` is a positive integer with a constraint of 1 <= n <= 10^5.
- `x` is an integer with a constraint of -10^9 <= x <= 10^9.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting of characters '0' and '1'.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return value based on the given constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (positive integer), n (positive integer), x (integer), and s (binary string of length n). The specific return value is not provided.**
