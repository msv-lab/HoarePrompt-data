Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, initialized with `prefix_balances[0]` as 0. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain `-1`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain an additional element `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated based on the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this `count` is appended to `results`. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1` and no elements are added to `results`.***
