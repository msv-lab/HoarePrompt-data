According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will continue iterating as long as there are more characters in the `fractions` string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, indicating that there are at least 3 characters in the string. Since `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one, we need to determine what the state should be for the loop to execute one more time.

For the loop to execute one more time, `fraction` must represent the next character in the string after the current one. Therefore, if `fraction` is currently the next character, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop will now be pointing to the next character in the `fractions` string. Consequently, `n` must be adjusted to reflect that there are still characters remaining in the string.

Since `n` is greater than 2, we can assume there are at least 3 characters, and after one iteration, there should be at least 2 characters left. Thus, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one.**
