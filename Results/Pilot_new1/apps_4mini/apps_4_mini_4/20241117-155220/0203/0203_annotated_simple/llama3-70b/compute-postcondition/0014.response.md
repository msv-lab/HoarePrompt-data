According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `fractions`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in the string. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `n` is greater than 1, `fractions` is a non-empty string, and `fraction` is the next character in the string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one more character left in the string after the current `fraction`. Since `fraction` is the next character, we need to ensure that there are at least 2 characters remaining in `fractions`. Therefore, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 2, and `fraction` should be set to the next character in the string after the current one.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `fractions` is a non-empty string, `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one.**
