The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `fractions` are not affected by this assignment, as they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of these variables without any changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0**
