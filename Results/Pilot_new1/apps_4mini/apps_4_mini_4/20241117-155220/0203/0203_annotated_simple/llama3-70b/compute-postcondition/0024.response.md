Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and `n` is the total length of `fractions`. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the output is 'D', indicating that there are more 'D' characters. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the output is 'R', indicating that there are either more non-'D' characters or they are equal. In either case, if `fractions` is an empty string or `n` is 0, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and the output will still reflect that state.***
