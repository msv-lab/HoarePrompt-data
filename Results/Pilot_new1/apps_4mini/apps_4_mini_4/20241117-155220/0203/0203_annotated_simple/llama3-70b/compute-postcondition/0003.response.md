The variable `remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0**
