The code appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_index` and `n` are not specified, but `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`, and `n` is an unknown integer. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `r_queue` after the append operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now includes `r_index + n`.**
