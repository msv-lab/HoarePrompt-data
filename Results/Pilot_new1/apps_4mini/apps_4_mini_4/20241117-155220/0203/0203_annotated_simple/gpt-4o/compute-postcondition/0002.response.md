The line `d_queue = []` initializes `d_queue` as an empty list. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer, and `votes` also remains unchanged as it is a string. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `d_queue` while keeping the other variables in their original state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
