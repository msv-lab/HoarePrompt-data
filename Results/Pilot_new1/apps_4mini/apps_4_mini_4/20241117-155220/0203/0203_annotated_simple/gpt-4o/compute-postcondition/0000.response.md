The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
