The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The variable `d_index` holds the value of the popped element from `d_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is added to `d_index`. The previous state of `d_queue` is affected as it now has one additional element, which is the result of the addition. The values of `r_queue` and `r_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (d_index + n), `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`**
