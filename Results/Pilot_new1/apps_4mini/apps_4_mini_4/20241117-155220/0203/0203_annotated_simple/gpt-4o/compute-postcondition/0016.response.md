The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The previous values are `n` as the length of `votes`, `i` as `n`, and `v` as `votes[n]`. The state of `votes` and `r_queue` is not specified, but the operation modifies `r_queue` by adding `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `i`, and the change in `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is the length of `votes`, `i` is `n`, `v` is `votes[n]`, and `i` is appended to `r_queue`**
