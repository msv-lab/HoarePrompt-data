The value of `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `r_queue`. Given that `d_index` is less than `r_index`, the code appends `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The state of `r_queue` remains unchanged, and the previous state of `d_queue` has one less element, but we do not know the specific values. Therefore, the output state reflects these conditions.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element, `r_queue` remains unchanged, `d_index` is less than `r_index`, and `d_queue` now includes `d_index + n`**
