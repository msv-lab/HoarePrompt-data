The code initializes `r_queue` as an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are unchanged, and the other variables remain as they were. Therefore, the output state reflects that `r_queue` has been created as an empty list while the initial conditions of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` are unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
