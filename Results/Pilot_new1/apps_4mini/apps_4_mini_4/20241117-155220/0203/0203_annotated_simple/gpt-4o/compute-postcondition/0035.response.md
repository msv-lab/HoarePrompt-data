The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` has at least 1 element, this operation is valid and will change the state of `r_queue`. The previous state of `r_queue` is not specified, but we know it will have one less element after the operation. `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the popped element from `r_queue`**.
