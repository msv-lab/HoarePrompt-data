The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which reads a string input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state indicates that `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The value of `n` is an input integer within the specified range. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the input characteristics of the `votes` variable.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
