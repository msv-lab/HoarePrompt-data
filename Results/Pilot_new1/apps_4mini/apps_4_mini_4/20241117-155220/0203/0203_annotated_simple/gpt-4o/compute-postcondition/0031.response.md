The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The variable `r_index` holds the value of the popped element from `r_queue`, and `n` is an additional value that is added to it. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged, and the previous state of `r_queue` is not specified, but it will now have one additional element after the append operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less element; `r_queue` has one less element, and now has an additional element which is `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element; `r_queue` has one less element and now has an additional element which is `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the value of the popped element from `r_queue`.**
