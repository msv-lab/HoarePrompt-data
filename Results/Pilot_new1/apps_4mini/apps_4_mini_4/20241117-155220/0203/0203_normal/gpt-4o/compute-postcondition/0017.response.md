Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, if `v` is equal to 'D', then `d_queue` includes `n` and `r_queue` remains unchanged; otherwise, if `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` includes `n` and `d_queue` remains unchanged. Additionally, `i` is equal to `n`, and `v` represents the next character in `votes` if it exists, or it does not exist if `n` is the last index.***
