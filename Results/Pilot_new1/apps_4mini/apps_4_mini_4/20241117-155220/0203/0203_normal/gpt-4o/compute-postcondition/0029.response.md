The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The `d_queue` remains unchanged in terms of its elements, and `d_index` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
