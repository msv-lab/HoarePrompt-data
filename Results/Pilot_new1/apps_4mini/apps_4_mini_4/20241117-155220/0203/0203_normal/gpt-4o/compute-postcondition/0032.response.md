Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n` appended if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `r_queue` has one more element with the value `r_index + n` appended. In both cases, `d_index` remains the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` remains the first element of the original `r_queue`.***
