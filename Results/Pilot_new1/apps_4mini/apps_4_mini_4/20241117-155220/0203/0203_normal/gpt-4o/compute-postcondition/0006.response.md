The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the `d_queue`. This modifies the `d_queue` to contain one element, which is the integer 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the first character of `votes`, `v`, is 'D'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, and the first character of `votes`, `v`, is 'D'**
