The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. The other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `d_queue` with the new value added.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` now includes `n`, `r_queue` is a list, `i` is `n`, `v` is the next character in `votes` if it exists, otherwise it does not exist.**
