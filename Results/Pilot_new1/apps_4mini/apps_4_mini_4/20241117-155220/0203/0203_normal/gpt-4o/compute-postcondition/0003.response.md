The variable `r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables, `n` and `votes`, remain unaffected as their values do not change. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, and `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list**
