The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue` list. Since `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the value appended to `r_queue` will be `n`. The state of the other variables (`votes`, `d_queue`, and `v`) remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is a list, `r_queue` now contains `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `v` is the next character in `votes` if it exists.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is a list, `r_queue` now contains `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, and `v` is the next character in `votes` if it exists.**
