The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The state of `d_queue` will change as it will now contain one additional element at the end. The values of `r_queue` and `r_index` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element (d_index + n appended), `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
