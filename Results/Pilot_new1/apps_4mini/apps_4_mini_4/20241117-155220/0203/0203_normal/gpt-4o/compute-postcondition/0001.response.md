The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `votes` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`**
