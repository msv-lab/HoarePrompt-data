The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the `r_queue`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, after execution, `r_queue` will contain the value 0, while the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is [0], `i` is 0, and the first character of `votes`, `v`, is not 'D'**
