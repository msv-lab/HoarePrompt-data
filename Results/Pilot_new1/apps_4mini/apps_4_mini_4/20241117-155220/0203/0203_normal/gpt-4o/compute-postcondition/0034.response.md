The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, which is removed from `d_queue` due to the `pop(0)` operation. The state of `r_queue` remains unchanged, while `d_queue` now has one less element. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has at least one element, and `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has at least one element, and `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`**
