Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has one more element if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, which is `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has one more element which is `r_index + n`. In both cases, `r_index` remains the value of the popped element from `r_queue`, and `d_queue` has one less element if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.***
