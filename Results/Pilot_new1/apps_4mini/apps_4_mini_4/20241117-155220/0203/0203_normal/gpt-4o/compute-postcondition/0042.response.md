Output State: **`votes` is an empty string or `d_queue` is non-empty; `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged if `votes` is an empty string; if `d_queue` is non-empty, the loop executes while both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, modifying `d_queue` and `r_queue` based on the comparisons of `d_index` and `r_index`. At the end of the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, and `v` is the character at index `i` in `votes`; the output is 'D'.**
