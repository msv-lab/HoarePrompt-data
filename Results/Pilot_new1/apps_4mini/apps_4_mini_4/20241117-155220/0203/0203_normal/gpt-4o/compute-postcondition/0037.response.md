The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The current state indicates that `r_index` has a value assigned from the first element of `r_queue`, and `n` is an integer that is added to `r_index`. The previous values of `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not specified but are noted to have one less element.

Since `r_queue` has one less element, it will now have a new element added to it, which is the result of `r_index + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element; `r_queue` is updated with `r_index + n`; `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
