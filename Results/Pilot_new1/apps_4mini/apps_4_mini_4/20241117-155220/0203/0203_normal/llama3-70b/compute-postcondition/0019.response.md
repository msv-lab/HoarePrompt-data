Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `fractions` is a string of length `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. If `n` is 0 (though the problem states `n` is positive), the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.**
