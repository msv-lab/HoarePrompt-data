The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string input consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The variable `n` remains unchanged, and its previous value is still valid as a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `fractions` based on user input, while `n` retains its initial value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' (updated based on input)**
