Postcondition: ***`depublicans` and `remocrats` are the counts of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string `fractions`, respectively. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the function prints 'D'. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the function prints 'R'. The string `fractions` has a length `n` such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. In the case where `n` is 0 (though not expected), both `depublicans` and `remocrats` would remain 0, and no output would occur.***
