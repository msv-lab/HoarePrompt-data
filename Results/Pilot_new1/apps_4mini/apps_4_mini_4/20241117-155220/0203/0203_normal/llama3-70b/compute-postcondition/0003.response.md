The variable `remocrats` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `depublicans` is 0; `remocrats` is 0**
