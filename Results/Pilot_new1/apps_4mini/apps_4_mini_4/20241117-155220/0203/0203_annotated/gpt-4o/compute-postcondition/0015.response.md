The code appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The variable `i` has a value of 2, and `d_queue` is assumed to be a list that exists in the current state. The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`, and `d_queue` now contains the value 2 appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; `v` is the third character of `votes`; `d_queue` contains the value 2 appended to it.**
