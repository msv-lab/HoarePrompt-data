Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; if the second character of `votes` (`v`) is 'D', then `d_queue` will contain the index 1 (making it either [0, 1] or [1]), and `r_queue` remains unchanged with the index 1; if `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` remains empty, and `r_queue` will contain the index 1. In both cases, `i` is 1 and `v` is either 'D' or not 'D'.***
