The code `d_queue.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. Given that `i` is 1, we need to check the previous values of the affected variables. The `d_queue` will contain the index `0` if the second character of `votes` (`v`) is 'D'; otherwise, it will be empty. Since `i` is 1, it will be appended to the `d_queue`. 

If `v` is 'D', the `d_queue` will now contain `[0, 1]`, and if `v` is not 'D', the `d_queue` will just contain `[1]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Therefore, the output state is:
- If `v` is 'D': `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `d_queue` is [0, 1]; `r_queue` contains the index 1; `i` is 1; `v` is 'D'.
- If `v` is not 'D': `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `d_queue` is [1]; `r_queue` contains the index 1; `i` is 1; `v` is not 'D'.

Thus, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `d_queue` is either [0, 1] or [1]; `r_queue` contains the index 1; `i` is 1; `v` is either 'D' or not 'D'.**
