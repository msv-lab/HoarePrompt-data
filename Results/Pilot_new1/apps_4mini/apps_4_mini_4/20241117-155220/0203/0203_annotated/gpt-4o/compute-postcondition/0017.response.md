Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is 2; and `v`, the third character of `votes`, determines the outcome. If `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` will contain the value 2 appended to it. If `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` will include the value 2. This ensures that the function correctly categorizes the index based on the character at the third position of the `votes` string.***
