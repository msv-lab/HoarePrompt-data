The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` is initially an empty list, after execution, `d_queue` will contain the value `[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
