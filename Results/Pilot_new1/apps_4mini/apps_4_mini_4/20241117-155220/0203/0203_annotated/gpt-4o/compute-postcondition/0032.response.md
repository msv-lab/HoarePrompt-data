Postcondition: ***`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` has an additional element which is `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged except for missing its first element. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` remains unchanged except for missing its first element, and `r_queue` has a new element which is `r_index + n`. In both cases, `n` is added to the corresponding index value being appended to the queues.***
