`r_queue` is modified by appending the current value of `i`, which is 0, to it. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains 0, `i` is 0, and the first character of `votes` (`v`) is not 'D'.
