The value of `r_index` is assigned the first element of `r_queue` by using the `pop(0)` method, which removes that first element from `r_queue`. The previous state of `d_index` and `d_queue` remains unchanged, but `r_queue` will now have one less element. Therefore, the output state is: `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now missing its first element, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `r_queue` is missing its first element.

Output State: **`d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now missing its first element, `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, and `r_queue` is missing its first element**
