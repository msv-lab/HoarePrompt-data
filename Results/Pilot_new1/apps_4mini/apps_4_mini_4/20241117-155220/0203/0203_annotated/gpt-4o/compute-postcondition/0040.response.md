Output State: **`if d_queue and r_queue are both non-empty then the loop executes and processes the indices, modifying d_queue and r_queue by removing their first elements and adding either d_index + n or r_index + n based on their comparison. If either d_queue or r_queue is empty before the loop starts, the loop does not execute, and both queues remain unchanged. If votes is an empty string, then both d_queue and r_queue are empty and the loop does not execute.`**
