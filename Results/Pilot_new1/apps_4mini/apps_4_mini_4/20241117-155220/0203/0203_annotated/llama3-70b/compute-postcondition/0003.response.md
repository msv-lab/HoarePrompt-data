`remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so the output state remains consistent with the initial conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0**.
