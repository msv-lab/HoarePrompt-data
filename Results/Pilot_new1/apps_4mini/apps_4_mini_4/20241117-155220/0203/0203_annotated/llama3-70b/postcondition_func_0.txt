The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `fractions` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string, both counts remain 0, and no output is generated. The function does not return any value, and the input for `n` is not used beyond its initial input.
