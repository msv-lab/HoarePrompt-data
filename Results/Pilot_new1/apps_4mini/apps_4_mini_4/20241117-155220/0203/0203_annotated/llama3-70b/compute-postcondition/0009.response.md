Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, if the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 (resulting in 1), and `remocrats` remains 0. Otherwise, if the first character of `fractions` is not 'D', `depublicans` remains 0 and `remocrats` is incremented by 1 (resulting in 1).***
