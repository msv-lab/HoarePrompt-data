Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are non-negative integers. If `fractions` is an empty string, then both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are 0. If `fractions` is not empty, then `depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, and `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D'.***
