Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute k times. The `seen` set will contain the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to k. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set. If any remainder is repeated during the loop execution, the program prints 'No' and exits. After the loop, `i` will be k, and `remainder` will be `n % k`.**
