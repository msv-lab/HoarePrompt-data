The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. As a result, no changes are made to the variables, and the program exits without returning any specific value. The output state reflects the current values of the variables before the exit occurs.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now the set containing `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is `n % 3`, and the output is 'No'**
