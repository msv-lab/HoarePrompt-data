The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen`. Since `seen` is initially 0, adding `remainder` does not affect the other variables. The output state reflects the change in the `seen` variable. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is now the set containing `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is now the set containing `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2**
