The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 3, so `remainder` will be calculated as `n % 3`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, the value of `remainder` will depend on the value of `n`. The other variables `k`, `seen`, and `i` remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` is now the set containing `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is `n % 3**
