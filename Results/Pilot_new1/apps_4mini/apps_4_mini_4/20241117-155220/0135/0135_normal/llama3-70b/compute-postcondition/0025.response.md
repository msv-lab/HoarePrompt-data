Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, then checks the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes' after completing the checks. The function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 1, meaning it has no output in such scenarios. **
