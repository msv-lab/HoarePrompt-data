The variable `seen_remainders` is assigned an empty set. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment, and since there is no return statement or further operation provided in the code snippet, the output state reflects the current values of `n`, `k`, and the new state of `seen_remainders`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
