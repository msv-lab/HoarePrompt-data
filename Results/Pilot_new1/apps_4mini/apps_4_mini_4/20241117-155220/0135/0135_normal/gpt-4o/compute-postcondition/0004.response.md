According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` ranging from 1 to `k` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `n` does not directly affect the execution of the loop. Before the loop starts, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, which does not influence the loop execution but can be updated within the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `k` is greater than or equal to 1. At the beginning of the first iteration, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
