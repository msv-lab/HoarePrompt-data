The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is found to have been seen before, it returns 'No'. If all checks are passed without duplicates in remainders, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 1, which would lead to no execution of the loop; however, given the constraints (1 â‰¤ `n`, `k`), this scenario should not occur.
