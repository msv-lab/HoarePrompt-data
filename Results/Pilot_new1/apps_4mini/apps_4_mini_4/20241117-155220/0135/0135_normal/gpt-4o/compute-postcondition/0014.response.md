Output State: **`seen_remainders` contains the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop executes up to `k` times. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. The function will return 'No' if any remainder is found in `seen_remainders` during execution. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the values of `remainder` will range from 0 to `k-1`, depending on the value of `n`.**
