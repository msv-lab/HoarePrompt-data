To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and check for potential edge cases.

The program is designed to determine if the remainders of the division of a number \( n \) by all integers from 1 to \( k \) are distinct. The logic can be summarized as follows:

1. If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \), the program immediately returns 'No'. This is because the remainders for \( n \mod 1 \) and \( n \mod n \) will always be the same (both will be 0), hence not distinct.
  
2. If \( k < n \), it initializes a set to keep track of seen remainders and iterates from 1 to \( k \). For each \( i \), it calculates the remainder \( n \mod i \) and checks if it has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'.

Now let's consider potential edge cases:

- When \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \):
  - The program will return 'Yes' because \( 1 \mod 1 = 0 \) and there are no other remainders to compare.
  
- When \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 2 \):
  - The remainders will be \( 2 \mod 1 = 0 \) and \( 2 \mod 2 = 0 \). The program will return 'No', which is correct.

- When \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - The remainders will be \( 3 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \), and \( 3 \mod 3 = 0 \). The program will return 'No', which is correct.

- When \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 4 \):
  - The remainders will be \( 4 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 4 \mod 3 = 1 \), and \( 4 \mod 4 = 0 \). The program will return 'No', which is correct.

- When \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - The remainders will be \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \), and \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \). The program will return 'Yes', which is correct.

However, there is a flaw in the logic regarding the case when \( k < n \). The program does not account for the fact that as \( i \) approaches \( n \), the remainders can still repeat for values of \( i \) greater than \( n/2 \). For instance:

- When \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 5 \):
  - The remainders will be \( 10 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 10 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 10 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 10 \mod 4 = 2 \), and \( 10 \mod 5 = 0 \). The program will return 'No', which is correct.
  
- When \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 6 \):
  - The remainders will be \( 10 \mod 1 = 0 \), \( 10 \mod 2 = 0 \), \( 10 \mod 3 = 1 \), \( 10 \mod 4 = 2 \), \( 10 \mod 5 = 0 \), and \( 10 \mod 6 = 4 \). The program will return 'No', which is correct.

Yet, the program fails to handle cases where \( k \) is significantly less than \( n \) without checking for distinctness properly across all values of \( k \).

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic as specified in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
