The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The previous state of the variables `n` and `k` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `seen_remainders`, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
