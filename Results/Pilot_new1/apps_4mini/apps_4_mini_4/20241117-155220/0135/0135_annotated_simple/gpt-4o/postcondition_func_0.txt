The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks for unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is repeated during this process, it returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, but this case is not explicitly handled, which could lead to confusion about the return value in such scenarios.
