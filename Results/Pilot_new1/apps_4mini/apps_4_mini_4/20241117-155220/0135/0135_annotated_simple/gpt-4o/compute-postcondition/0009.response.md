According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `k` is at least 1, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be updated to 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is 0.**
