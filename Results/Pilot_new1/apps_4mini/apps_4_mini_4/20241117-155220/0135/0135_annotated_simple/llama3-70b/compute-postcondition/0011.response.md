The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged after execution. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the function prints 'No'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` contains 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and the function prints 'No'**
