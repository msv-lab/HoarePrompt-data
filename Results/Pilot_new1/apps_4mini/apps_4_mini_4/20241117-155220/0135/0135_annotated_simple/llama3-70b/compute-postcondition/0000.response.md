The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from user input, which are converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are unknown but they are constrained to be integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ \(10^{18}\), and they are assigned new integer values from input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and they are assigned new integer values from input**.
