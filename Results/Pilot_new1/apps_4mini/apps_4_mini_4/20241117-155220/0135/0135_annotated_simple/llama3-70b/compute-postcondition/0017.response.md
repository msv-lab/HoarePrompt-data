The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable values along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains 0 and 1, `i` is 3, `remainder` is now equal to `n % 3, and the output is 'No'**
