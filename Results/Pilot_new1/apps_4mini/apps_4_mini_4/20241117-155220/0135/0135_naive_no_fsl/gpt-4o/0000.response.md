To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze how it processes the input values `n` and `k` and whether it accurately checks for distinct remainders when `n` is divided by all integers from `1` to `k`.

### Program Analysis

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Immediate Check for k >= n**: 
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns `'No'`. This is incorrect because the remainders for `i` from `1` to `k` can still be distinct even if `k` is greater than `n`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the remainders would be `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which are distinct.
3. **Remainder Calculation**: 
   - The program iterates from `1` to `k`, calculates the remainder `n % i`, and checks if this remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns `'No'`.
   - If all remainders are distinct, it returns `'Yes'`.

### Test Cases

To check the correctness, we can consider the following cases:

- **Case 1**: `n = 5`, `k = 6`
  - Expected Output: `Yes` (Remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - Actual Output: `No` (due to the k >= n check)

- **Case 2**: `n = 4`, `k = 4`
  - Expected Output: `No` (Remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3)
  - Actual Output: `No` (correct)

- **Case 3**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Expected Output: `Yes` (Remainders: 0, 1, 2)
  - Actual Output: `Yes` (correct)

From the analysis and the test cases, we see that the program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n` correctly.

### Conclusion

Since the program fails to produce the correct output for the case `n = 5`, `k = 6`, it does not satisfy the problem requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
