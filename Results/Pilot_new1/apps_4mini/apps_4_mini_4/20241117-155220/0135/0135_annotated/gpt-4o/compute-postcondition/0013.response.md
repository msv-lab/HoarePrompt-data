According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` relative to `k`. The loop is set to execute for `i` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`, meaning it will iterate from 1 up to and including `k`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is currently 3, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. 

If `k` is 3, the next value of `i` will be 4, which is outside the range of the loop (1 to `k + 1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4. 

Additionally, since `i` is incremented in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be adjusted to 4.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 4.
- `i` should be adjusted to 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
