The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{18}\). 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. If `k` is less than `n`, there is no return value from the function.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `seen_remainders` is an empty set. If `k` is at least 1, then `seen_remainders` contains at least the value 0. If `k` is 2 or more, the function returns 'No' immediately after the first iteration because remainder 0 will be found in `seen_remainders`.
- In Case 3, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n` or if `k` is 2 or more after the first iteration. If `k` is less than `n` and does not meet the conditions for returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n` or if `k` is 2 or more after the first iteration. If `k` is less than `n` and does not meet the conditions for returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.**
