The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 1, the result of the modulo operation will be `n % 1`, which is always 0 for any positive integer `n`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
