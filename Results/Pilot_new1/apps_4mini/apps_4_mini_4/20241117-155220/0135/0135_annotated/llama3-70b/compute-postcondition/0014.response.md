The code adds `remainder` to the set `seen`. Since `remainder` is either 0 or 1 and `seen` already includes `remainder`, it is possible that `remainder` is already in `seen`. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program would have printed 'No' and exited, but since we are executing the line `seen.add(remainder)`, it indicates that `remainder` is not in `seen` at this moment. Therefore, `remainder` is successfully added to `seen`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` includes `remainder` and now also includes the added `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**.
