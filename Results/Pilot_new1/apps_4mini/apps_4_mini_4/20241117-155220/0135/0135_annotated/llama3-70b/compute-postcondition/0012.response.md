The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. None of the variables are modified or changed, and the program stops executing. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` now includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
