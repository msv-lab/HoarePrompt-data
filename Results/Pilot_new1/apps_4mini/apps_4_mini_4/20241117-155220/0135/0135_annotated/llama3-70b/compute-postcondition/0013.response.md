Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` includes `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues execution without printing 'No' or exiting.***
