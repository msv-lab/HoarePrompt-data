The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'No'. This operation does not change the values of any existing variables but simply displays the message. The values of `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is as follows: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes `remainder` and the added `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` includes `remainder` and the added `remainder`, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
