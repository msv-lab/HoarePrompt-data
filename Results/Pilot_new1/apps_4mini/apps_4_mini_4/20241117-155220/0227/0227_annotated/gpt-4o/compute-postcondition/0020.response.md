Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such element is found after iterating through `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. If `i` is equal to or greater than the length of `a`, then the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` is False.**
