Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists an element in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, indicating that either no such element exists or that `assigned` is empty (in which case `can_form` remains False without iteration), then `m` is increased by 1.***
