Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that the difference `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; otherwise, if `can_form` is False, `m` is unchanged or incremented by 1. Regardless of the value of `can_form`, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `assigned` now includes `a[i]`, and `i` is 1 or 2 depending on the iteration.**
