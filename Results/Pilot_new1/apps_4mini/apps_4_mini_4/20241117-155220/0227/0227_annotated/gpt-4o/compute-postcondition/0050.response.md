The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[n-1]`, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[n-1]`, and the difference between `a[1]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.
