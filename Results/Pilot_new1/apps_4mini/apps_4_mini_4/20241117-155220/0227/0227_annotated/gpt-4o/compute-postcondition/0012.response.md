The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not altered by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the initial values of the other variables, while `can_form` is now `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `x` is `a[0]`, and `can_form` is True**
