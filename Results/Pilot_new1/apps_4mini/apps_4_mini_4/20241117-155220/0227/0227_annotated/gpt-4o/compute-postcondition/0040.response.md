According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in `assigned`. Since `assigned` contains more elements, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `assigned` has more elements, and `x` is the current element being iterated over. For the loop to execute again, we need to set `x` to the next element in `assigned`, and we also need to account for the fact that the loop continues as long as there are elements in `assigned`.

Assuming that the loop hasn't exhausted all elements in `assigned`, we must ensure that `x` is set to the next element in the list. 

State: **`can_form` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains more elements, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`**
