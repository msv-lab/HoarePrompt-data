The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not depend on any previous values of the affected variables, and it does not affect any other variables in the state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `m` is 1, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**
