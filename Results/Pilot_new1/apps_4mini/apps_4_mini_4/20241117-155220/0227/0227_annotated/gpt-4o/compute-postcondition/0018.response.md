Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `m` is 1, and `x` is the third element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing the subsequent statements.***
