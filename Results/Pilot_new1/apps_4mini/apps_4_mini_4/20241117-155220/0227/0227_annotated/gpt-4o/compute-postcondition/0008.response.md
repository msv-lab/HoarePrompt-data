The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains `a[0]`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.**
