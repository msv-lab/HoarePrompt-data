The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. Other variables (`m`, `assigned`, and `x`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is `True`, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in the assigned list.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` is a list with at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the assigned list**
