The value of `a` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes a space-separated input of integers, converts them to integers, and creates a list. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. The output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of distinct positive integers based on the input provided while `n` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct positive integers, `n` is an input integer**
