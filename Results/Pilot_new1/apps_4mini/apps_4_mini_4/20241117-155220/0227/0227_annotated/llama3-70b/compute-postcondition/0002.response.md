The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` is not directly affected by the sorting operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the list `a` after sorting, while `n` remains as an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers, `n` is an input integer**
