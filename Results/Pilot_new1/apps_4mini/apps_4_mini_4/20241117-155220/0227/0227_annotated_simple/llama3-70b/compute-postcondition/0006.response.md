The value of `m` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 1 to 2. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `a` is not equal to double the element at index `i - 1` of `a`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `m` is 2, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` of `a` is not equal to double the element at index `i - 1` of `a`.**
