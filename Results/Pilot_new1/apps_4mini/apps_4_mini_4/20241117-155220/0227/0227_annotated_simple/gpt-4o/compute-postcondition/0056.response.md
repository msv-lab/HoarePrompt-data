Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if the value `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, while `m` and `n` remain unchanged. `i` is incremented by 1, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, `m` and `n` remain unchanged, `assigned` still contains at least one element, and `i` is incremented by 1.***
