Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists a value `a[i] - x` in `assigned` for any `x` in `assigned`; otherwise, if `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1 while `n` remains unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by the number of iterations executed, and `assigned` contains at least one element. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False, with `m` and `n` unchanged.***
