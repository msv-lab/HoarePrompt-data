Postcondition: ***`can_form` is set to True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (the next element in `assigned`) exists in `assigned`. The values of `m` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `assigned` contains at least one element. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
