Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `i + 1` is a valid index for `a`, and `m` and `n` remain unchanged. If the value of `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
