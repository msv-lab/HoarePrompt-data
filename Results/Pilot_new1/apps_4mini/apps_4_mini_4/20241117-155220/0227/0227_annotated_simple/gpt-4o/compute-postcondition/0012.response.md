The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This does not affect any of the other variables, which retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `m` is 1, `x` is `a[1]`, and `can_form` is True.
