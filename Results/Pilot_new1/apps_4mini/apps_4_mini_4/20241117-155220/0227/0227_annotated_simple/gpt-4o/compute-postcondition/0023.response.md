Postcondition: ***If `assigned` contains at least one element from the list `a` and `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1. If `assigned` is empty or `can_form` is True, then `m` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `assigned`, and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.***
