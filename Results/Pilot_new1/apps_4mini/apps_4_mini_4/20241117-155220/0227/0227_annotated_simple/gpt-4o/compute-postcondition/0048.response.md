According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `assigned` variable. For the loop to execute, `assigned` must contain at least one element. Given that `assigned` now includes `a[i + 1]`, it implies that `i` has been incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be at least 0, and `assigned` must not be empty.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `assigned` contains at least one element after including `a[i + 1]`. Consequently, we can state that `i` is now at least 0, and the loop will iterate over the elements in `assigned`.

State: **`can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**
