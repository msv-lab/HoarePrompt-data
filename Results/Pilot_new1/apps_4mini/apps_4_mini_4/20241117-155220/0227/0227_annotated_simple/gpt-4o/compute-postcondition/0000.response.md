The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and each integer in `a` satisfies the condition of being between 1 and \(10^9\). The sorting operation will rearrange the elements of `a` without changing the number of elements or their distinctness.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_k` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_k` ≤ 10^9.**
