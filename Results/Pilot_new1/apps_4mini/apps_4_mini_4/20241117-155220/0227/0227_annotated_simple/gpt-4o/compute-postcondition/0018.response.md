Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least three distinct integers, `m` is 1, and `x` is one of the elements in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues without any effect from this conditional check.***
