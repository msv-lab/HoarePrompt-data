Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains at least one element, `i + 1` is a valid index for `a`, `m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False.***
