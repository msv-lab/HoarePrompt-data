The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state of `can_form` was already `True`, so it remains unchanged. The values of `m`, `n`, and `assigned` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects that `can_form` is `True`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `assigned` contains at least one element, `i` is incremented by 1**
