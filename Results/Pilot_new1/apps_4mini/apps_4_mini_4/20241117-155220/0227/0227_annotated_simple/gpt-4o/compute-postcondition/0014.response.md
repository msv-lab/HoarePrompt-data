Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `m` is 1, and `x` is `a[1]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking.***
