The function accepts an integer input `n`, which represents the number of elements in a list, followed by `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list are not equal to double the previous element. If `m` (the count of such elements) is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function will always print 1 since the loop will not execute, which means the function can return 1 for such cases regardless of the input.
