Output State: **`can_form` is True if any `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` for any `x` in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty or contains only one element, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. If `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains elements from `a`, `m` is 1, and `i` is 1.**
