Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False unless `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, in which case `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `n` remains at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least one element (specifically `a[1]`), `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, and `x` is `a[1]` throughout the execution.***
