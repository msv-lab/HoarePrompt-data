Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, while `m` remains at least 3, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is not satisfied, `can_form` remains False, and all other preconditions still hold.***
