Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, indicating that a valid condition has been met. If this condition is not satisfied, `can_form` remains unchanged, but since there is no else part, the state of `can_form` will depend solely on whether the condition was true or false. Additionally, `n` remains at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` contains at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to 2, and `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`.***
