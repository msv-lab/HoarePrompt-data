Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, and `assigned` contains elements from `a`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented to 2, while `i` remains 1. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains 1 and `i` remains 1, ensuring that `m` only increases when `can_form` is not satisfied.***
