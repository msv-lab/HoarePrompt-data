Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is a[0]. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False, and the program continues without any changes to the other variables.***
