According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. 

Given that `can_form` is True, it means that there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. In the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to its next value, which would be `i + 1`. Since `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[i]`, the state of `assigned` will also change accordingly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- `assigned` will contain the new element `a[i + 1]`.

State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is at least 4, `assigned` contains an additional element `a[i + 1]`, `i` is the next value (i + 1)**
