Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` is [a[0], a[1]], `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is a[1]. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating that a valid formation is possible, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged, and no further action is taken in this block.***
