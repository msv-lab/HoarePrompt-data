According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it allows for one more iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`can_form` is False, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers, `assigned` now contains an additional element `a[1]`, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
