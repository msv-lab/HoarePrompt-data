The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The values of `floor_b` and the other variables are not provided, but `min_walk_time` remains unchanged since it is not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `time_to_target_floor` without changing `min_walk_time`.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is (floor_b - 1) * 5**
