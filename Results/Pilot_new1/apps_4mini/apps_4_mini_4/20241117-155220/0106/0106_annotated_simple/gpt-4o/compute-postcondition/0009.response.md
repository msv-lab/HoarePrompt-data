To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we first analyze the variables involved:

1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
2. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.
3. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Since the specific values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the relationships and outcomes based on the calculations.

- `min_walk_time` will hold the lesser of the two calculated times: `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Thus, the output state reflects the relationships and calculations without specific values. 

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**
