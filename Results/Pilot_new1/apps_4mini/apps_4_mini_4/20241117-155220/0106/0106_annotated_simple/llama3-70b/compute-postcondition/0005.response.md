The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `m` and `k` are not specified, but they are integers from input, and `b` is also an integer from input. The calculation involves integer division of `(b - 1)` by `(m * k)`, and then adding 1 to the result. The values of `n`, `a`, `a_floor`, `a_block`, and `b_floor` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `b_block` based on the calculation.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned integer values from input; `a` and `b` are assigned integer values from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
