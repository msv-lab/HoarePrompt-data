To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`
- `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`
- `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`
- `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`

The code snippet computes:
```
total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
```

Now, let's break down the impact of this code:
1. `total_time` is assigned the sum of three variables: `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.
2. The values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are combined to compute `total_time`.
3. The values of `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` are not directly changed, but they are used to determine `min_walk_time`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables involved in the computation of `total_time`, while also indicating that `total_time` has been calculated.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, and `total_time` is `time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor`**.
