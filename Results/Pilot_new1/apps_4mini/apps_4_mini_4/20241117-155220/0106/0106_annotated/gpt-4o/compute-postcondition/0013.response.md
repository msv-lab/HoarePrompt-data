The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. After executing the function body, it returns the total time calculated as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and two distinct integers `a` and `b`, and return the total time based on the calculated components. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers), and a, b (distinct integers), and returns the total time calculated as time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor.**
