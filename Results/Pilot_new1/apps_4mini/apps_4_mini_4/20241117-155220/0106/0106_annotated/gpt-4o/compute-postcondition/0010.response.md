The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. This calculation depends on the value of `floor_b`, which is not provided in the initial state. The other variables `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and `min_walk_time` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new variable `time_to_target_floor`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`**
