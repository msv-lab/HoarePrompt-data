Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `n`, `m`, `k` (where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and two distinct integers `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). It calculates the total time required to exit from the location represented by `a` to the location represented by `b`. This total time is computed as the sum of the time to exit the current floor, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The function does not handle potential edge cases related to invalid inputs or the behavior when `a` and `b` are not distinct, which could lead to unexpected results.**
