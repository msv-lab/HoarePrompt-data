The function accepts an integer `apartment` and calculates the `block` and `floor` within a multi-block structure based on the apartment's position. It returns the `block` number, which indicates the group of apartments, and the `floor` number, which indicates the specific floor within that block. However, the function assumes that the variables `m` and `k` are defined globally, which could lead to errors if they are not set before the function is called.
