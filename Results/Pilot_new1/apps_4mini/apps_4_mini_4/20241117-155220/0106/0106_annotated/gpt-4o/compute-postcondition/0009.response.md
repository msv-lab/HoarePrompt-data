To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet provided.

Initial State: 
- `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`
- `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`

The code snippet provided is:
```
min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
```

Now, let's break down the impact of the code:
1. The variable `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.
2. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` remain unchanged during this operation, but `min_walk_time` will hold the smaller of the two.

Since we do not have specific values for `block_a`, `block_b`, or `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical values for `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. Therefore, we will express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, `reverse_walk_time` is `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`, and `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
