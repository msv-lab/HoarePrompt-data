Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input; `a`, `b` are integers from input; `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `a_block`, `b_block`, and `min_block_time` are calculated values; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the result of `min_block_time + min_floor_time` is printed.**
