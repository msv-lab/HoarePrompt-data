To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the program based on the initial state.

1. The variable `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.
2. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are already determined from previous calculations, and it is stated that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.
3. Therefore, `b_floor - a_floor` will be a non-negative integer.
4. The result of the expression `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5` will be added to `10` to compute `min_floor_time`.

Since we do not have the specific numerical values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`, we will express the output in general terms. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input; `a`, `b` are the two integers from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
