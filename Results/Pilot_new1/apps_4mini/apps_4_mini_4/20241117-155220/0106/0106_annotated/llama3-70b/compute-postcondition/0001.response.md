The values of `a` and `b` are assigned from the input, which consists of two integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not specified but are distinct integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k`. After execution, `a` and `b` will hold the values of the two integers provided as input. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input, and `a`, `b` are now the two integers from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from input, and `a`, `b` are now the two integers from input**
