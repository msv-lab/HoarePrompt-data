The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, particularly the value of `floor_b`. Therefore, the output state will reflect this uncertainty regarding `floor_b`.

Output State: **`min_walk_time` is calculated as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` based on the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`; `time_to_target_floor` is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`**
