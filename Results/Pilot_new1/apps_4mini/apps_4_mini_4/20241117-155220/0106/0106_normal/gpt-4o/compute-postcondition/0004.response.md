The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer representing an apartment number within the range 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, it returns the values of `block` and `floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding values of `block` and `floor` based on the apartment number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' corresponding to the given apartment number.**
