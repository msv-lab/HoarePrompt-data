Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input integers; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` and `b_block` are dependent on an undefined variable `b`, thus cannot be calculated; `min_floor_time` cannot be definitively calculated due to the undefined `b_floor`; therefore, `min_block_time + min_floor_time` cannot be printed as the value is uncertain.**
