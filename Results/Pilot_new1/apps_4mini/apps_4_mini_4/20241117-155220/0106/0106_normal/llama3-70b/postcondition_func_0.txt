The function accepts input values for integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` via standard input, calculates the block and floor levels for both `a` and `b`, and computes the minimum time required to travel between these two points based on their respective positions. It outputs the total time calculated as the sum of block time and floor time. However, due to the lack of explicit return statements and the reliance on input, the function does not return any value and instead prints the result directly. Additionally, there is a potential issue where `b_floor` is calculated based on the input `b`, which is defined but not handled in the annotations, leading to uncertainty in the final value if `b` is not provided correctly.
