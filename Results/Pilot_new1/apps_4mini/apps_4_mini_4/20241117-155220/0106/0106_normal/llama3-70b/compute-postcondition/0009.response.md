Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input integers. `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1. `b_floor` is dependent on an undefined variable `b`, and `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, which means that `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`. The variable `b` remains undefined, so `min_block_time` cannot be calculated.***
