The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates based on the constraints provided for the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers constrained to the range 1 to 1000. The integers `a` and `b` represent distinct apartment numbers within the range from 1 to `n·m·k`. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot describe specific return values or cases.

Functionality: **The function operates with positive integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and distinct integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k), but does not explicitly accept parameters or define a return value in the given information.**
