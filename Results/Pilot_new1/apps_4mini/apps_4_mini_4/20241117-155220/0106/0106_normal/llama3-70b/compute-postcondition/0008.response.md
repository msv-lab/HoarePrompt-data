The code attempts to calculate `min_floor_time` using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. However, `b_floor` is dependent on the undefined variable `b`, which means it cannot be calculated. Consequently, `min_floor_time` cannot be determined due to the undefined variable.

The output state reflects that while `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the calculation for `min_floor_time` is not possible. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a` are input integers; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is undefined; `b_block` is undefined; `min_block_time` cannot be calculated; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.**
