The variables `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which is split and converted to integers. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` after the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned values from input; `a` and `b` are now input integers**
