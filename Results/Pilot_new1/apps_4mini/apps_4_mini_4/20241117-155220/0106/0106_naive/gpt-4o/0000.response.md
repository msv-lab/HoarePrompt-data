To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and calculations involved in the function `func_1`.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic

1. **Location Calculation**:
   - The function `get_location` calculates the block (entrance) and floor of the apartment based on its number. This seems to be correctly implemented.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment on the first floor. This includes a 10-second wait if he is not already on the first floor and an additional time corresponding to the number of floors he needs to descend.
   - It calculates the time to walk to Natasha's block using both direct and reverse walking times, which are handled correctly with modulo operations to account for the circular nature of the building.
   - Finally, it calculates the time to ascend to Natasha's floor.

### Potential Issues

- The calculation of `time_to_exit` assumes that if Edward is already on the first floor (`floor_a == 1`), it takes 0 seconds to exit. However, if he is on the first floor, he should not be considered as taking any time to exit, which is correct.
- The calculation of walking time between blocks does not consider the case where Edward is in the last block and needs to go to the first block, which should also work due to the modulo operation.
- The calculation for the time to ascend to Natasha's floor (`time_to_target_floor`) is straightforward and should work correctly as it multiplies the number of floors by 5 seconds.

### Edge Cases to Consider

1. **Edge Case 1**: If Edward lives in the first block on the first floor and Natasha lives in the last block on the last floor, the program should correctly calculate the total time including the walking time around the building.
2. **Edge Case 2**: If both live on the same floor but in different blocks, the walking time should be minimal since they can go directly to each other.

### Test Case Analysis

- For the input `4 10 5` with apartments `200` and `6`, the output is `39`, which is correct based on the example provided in the problem description.
- For the input `3 1 5` with apartments `7` and `2`, the output is `15`, which is also correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the implementation, it appears that the logic for calculating the time taken for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment is correctly implemented based on the problem description. No edge cases or potential issues were found that would cause the program to fail for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
