According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `x`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the next value, which means it has already been incremented by 1. Therefore, to determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`.

Since `i` is the next value (previous value + 1), we need to adjust `i` to be equal to its current value (which is the previous value + 1) and ensure that it is still within the range of 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, which means we must adjust the condition accordingly.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `x` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`**
