According to the code, the loop iterates over integers `i` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is currently 1. Since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented. 

To determine the new state of `i`, we can increment it by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. 

We also need to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(x))` remains unchanged, which means `x` should not change, and thus `int(math.sqrt(x))` will still be valid for the next iteration. 

The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains the value 1 if `x` is 1 and `i` is 2**
