Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `x` remains unchanged, and `i` is the next value (previous value + 1). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` and `x // i` are added to the set of divisors. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set of divisors remains unchanged.***
