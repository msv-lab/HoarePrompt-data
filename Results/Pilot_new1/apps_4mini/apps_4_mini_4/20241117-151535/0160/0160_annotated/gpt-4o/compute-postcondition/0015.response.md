Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all divisors of `x` found up to `sqrt(x)`. If `x` is a perfect square, the set will include the square root of `x` only once. If `x` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set. If `x` equals 1, the loop executes once, and `divisors` will contain only the value 1. If `x` is greater than 1, the loop will execute up to `sqrt(x)` times, adding divisors as found.**
