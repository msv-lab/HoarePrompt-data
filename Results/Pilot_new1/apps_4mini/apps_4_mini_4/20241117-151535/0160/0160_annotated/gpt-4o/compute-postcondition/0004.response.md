The value `x` is 1, and `i` is an integer such that `x` is divisible by `i`. Since `x` is 1, the only integer `i` that satisfies this condition is 1 itself. 

The code `divisors.add(x // i)` calculates `x // i`, which is `1 // 1`, resulting in 1. The value 1 is then added to the set `divisors`.

Assuming `divisors` initially contains no values or is empty, after executing the code, `divisors` will now contain the value 1.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now contains the value 1, `x` is 1, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now contains the value 1, `x` is 1, and `i` is 1**
