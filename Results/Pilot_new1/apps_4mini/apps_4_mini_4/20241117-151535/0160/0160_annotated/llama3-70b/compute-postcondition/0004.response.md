The value of `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of its current value and `A[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `gcd` will be calculated as `math.gcd(gcd, A[1])`. The previous value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `A[i]` is `A[1]`. The specific values of `A[0]` and `A[1]` are unknown, but the operation will yield a new `gcd` based on those two values.

Therefore, the output state reflects that `gcd` has been updated based on the values of `A[0]` and `A[1]`. The state of other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 1**
