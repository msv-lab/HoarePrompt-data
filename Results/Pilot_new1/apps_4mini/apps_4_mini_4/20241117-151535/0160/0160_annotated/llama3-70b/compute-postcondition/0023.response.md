Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. If `gcd % i == 0`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged, ensuring that if `gcd` is a perfect square of `i`, its initial value is retained. This logic accounts for all scenarios where `i` is a divisor of `gcd` and ensures that `max_divisor` reflects the largest divisor found.***
