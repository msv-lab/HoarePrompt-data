According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. The loop iterates from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

Since the loop is structured to iterate up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, and we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.

The value of `max_divisor` is not affected by the loop iteration count; it will remain as it is since the loop body is omitted and does not provide additional context.

State: **`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `gcd` remains unchanged**
