According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will also be at least 1.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` for the loop to execute again. If `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the loop will not execute again, but if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, it can execute again.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increase the value of `i` by 1, and ensure that it is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

If `i` is currently equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we need to increase `gcd` such that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` becomes `i + 1`. Therefore, we can adjust `gcd` to be at least `(i + 1) ** 2`.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to `((i + 1) ** 2)`, `i` is `i + 1`**
