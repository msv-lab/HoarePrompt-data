Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Overall, `max_divisor` reflects the highest divisor of `gcd` found based on the value of `i`, ensuring that all potential divisors up to the square root of `gcd` are considered.***
