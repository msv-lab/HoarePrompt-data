The variable `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the current `gcd` and the element `A[i]`, where `i` is 2. The initial value of `gcd` is `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, and the value of `A[i]` is `A[2]`. The state of `N`, `K`, and `A` does not change with this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is greater than 2, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[2]), and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 2, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[2]), `i` is 2**
