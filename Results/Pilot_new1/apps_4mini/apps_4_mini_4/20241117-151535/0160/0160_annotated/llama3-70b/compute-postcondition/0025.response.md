The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value (which is `gcd`) and the value of `i` (which is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`). The exact values of `max_divisor` and `i` depend on the value of `gcd`. 

Therefore, if `gcd` is known, we can calculate `i`. However, since `gcd` is not explicitly provided, we will denote it as a variable. 

The output state will reflect that `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated to max(`gcd`, `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`)**
