The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than two elements, it returns the first element as the GCD. The function assumes that the list is non-empty and that the first element exists. If the list is empty, the behavior is undefined, as there would be an attempt to access `lst[0]`.
