Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all unique divisors of `x` that are found by iterating `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop executes at least once, and `divisors` may contain integers derived from both `i` and `x // i` when `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `divisors` remains an empty set.**
