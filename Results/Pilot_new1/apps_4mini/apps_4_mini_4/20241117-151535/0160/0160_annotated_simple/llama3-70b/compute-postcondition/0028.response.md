Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 3. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its initial state and `gcd // 3`, unless `i * i` equals `gcd`, in which case `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`.***
