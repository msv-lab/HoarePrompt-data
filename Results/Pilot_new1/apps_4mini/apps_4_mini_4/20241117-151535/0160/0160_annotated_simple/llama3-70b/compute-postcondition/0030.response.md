Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` that is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`, and `i` is the current divisor being checked. If `N` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `max_divisor` remains equal to `A[0]`. If `gcd` is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `max_divisor` will also remain equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, the loop will execute only once, and `max_divisor` will remain 1.**
