According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 and going up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. 

Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 1, and thus the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows: `i` should be updated to 2. There is no need to change `max_divisor` since it remains `gcd`, and `gcd` does not change.

State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2**
