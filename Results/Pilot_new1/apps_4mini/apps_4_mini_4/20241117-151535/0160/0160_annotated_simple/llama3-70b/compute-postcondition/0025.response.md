The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of `max_divisor` and `i`. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` and is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 3, the value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged because it is greater than `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` (which is greater than or equal to 4), `i` is 3.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd` (which is greater than or equal to 4), `i` is 3**
