According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Since `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 4, we need to determine if the loop can execute again. 

To check if the loop can execute one more time, we need to find the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is at least 4, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be at least 2. Given that `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

If `gcd` is 9, for example, `int(math.sqrt(9))` is 3, and the loop can execute again with `i` incremented to 4. However, if `gcd` is greater than 9, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` will be greater than 3, allowing the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `i` is incremented to 4, and we must also confirm that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 4**
