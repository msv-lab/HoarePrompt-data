Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is less than 2, `max_divisor` will remain 2 if it was not updated.***
