The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. The other variables `N` and `K` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `gcd` and the unchanged values of `N` and `K`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers based on user input, `gcd` is A[0]**
