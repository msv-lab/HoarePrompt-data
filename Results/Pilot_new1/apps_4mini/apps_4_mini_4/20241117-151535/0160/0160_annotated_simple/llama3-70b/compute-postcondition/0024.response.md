According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. The loop condition is `i < int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check the value of `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Since `i` is currently 2, this means that `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `gcd` should be at least 4 (since `sqrt(4) = 2`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `gcd` is at least 4.

The states that need to be adjusted are:
- `gcd` should be greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` should be updated to 3 for the next iteration.

State: **`max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 3.**
