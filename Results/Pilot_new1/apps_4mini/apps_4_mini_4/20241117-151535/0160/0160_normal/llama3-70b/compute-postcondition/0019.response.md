According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. The variable `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition for the loop to continue. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that it is incremented for the next iteration. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. The value of `gcd` does not change, and we do not need to adjust it.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i`.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is initially set to `gcd`, `i` is 2**
