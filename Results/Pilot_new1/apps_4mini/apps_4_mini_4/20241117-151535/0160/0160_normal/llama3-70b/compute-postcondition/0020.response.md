The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`. Initially, `max_divisor` is set to `gcd`, which is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 2. Therefore, `max_divisor` will be updated to the maximum of `gcd` and 2. The output state will reflect the possible values of `max_divisor`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or 2 (whichever is greater), `i` is 2**
