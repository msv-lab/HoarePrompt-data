Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`. If `i` is 1, and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. If `gcd` is 1, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged as both `gcd` and `max_divisor` are equal to 1.***
