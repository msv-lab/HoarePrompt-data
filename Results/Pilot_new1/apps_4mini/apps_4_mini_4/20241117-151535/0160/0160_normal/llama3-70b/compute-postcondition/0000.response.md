The values of `N` and `K` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` takes user input and `map(int, ...)` converts those inputs into integers. The values of `N` and `K` will be determined by the user input, while the state of `A` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `N` and `K` as integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `A` is a list of integers where each A_i is between 1 and 10^6**
