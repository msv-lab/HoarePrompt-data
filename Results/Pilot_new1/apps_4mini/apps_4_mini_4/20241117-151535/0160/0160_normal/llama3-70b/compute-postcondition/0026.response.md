The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. The variable `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` has been updated to `i + 1`. The exact previous values of `max_divisor` and `i` are not specified, but we can infer that `max_divisor` will be assigned the greater of its previous value or the result of the division `gcd // (i + 1)`. Therefore, the output state reflects the changes made to `max_divisor` based on the updated value of `i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // (i + 1)`**
