Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`. If `gcd` is not a perfect square, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is a perfect square, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
