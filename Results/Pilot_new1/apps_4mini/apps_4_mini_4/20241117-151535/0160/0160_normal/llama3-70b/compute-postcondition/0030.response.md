Output State: **`max_divisor` is the largest divisor of `gcd` found in the range from 1 to the square root of `gcd`, inclusive. If `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop will execute at least once. If `gcd` is 0, the loop does not execute and `max_divisor` remains equal to `gcd`. If `gcd` is 1, `max_divisor` will remain 1 as it has no divisors greater than 1.**
