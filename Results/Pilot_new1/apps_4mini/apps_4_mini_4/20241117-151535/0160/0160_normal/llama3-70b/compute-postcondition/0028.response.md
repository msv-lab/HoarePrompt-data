Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` has been incremented by 1. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
