Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or 2 (whichever is greater). If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `gcd` is a perfect square, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
