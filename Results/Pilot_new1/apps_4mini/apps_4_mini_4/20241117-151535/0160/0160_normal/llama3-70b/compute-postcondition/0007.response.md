According to the code, the loop will execute for `i` values starting from 1 up to `N - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `N` is between 2 and 500. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `N` is at least 3 (to ensure that `i` can be 3 and still be less than `N`), we can conclude that `N` must be at least 3. 

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `N` must be at least 3.
- `i` should be updated to 3.

No other states need to be adjusted as they remain valid.

State: **`N` is between 3 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[2]), `i` is 3**
