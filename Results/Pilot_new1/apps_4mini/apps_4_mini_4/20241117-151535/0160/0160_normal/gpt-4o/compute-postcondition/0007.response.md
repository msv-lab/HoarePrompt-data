The code adds the integer `i` to the set `divisors`. The initial value of `i` is 2, and `divisors` already includes the integers 1 and `K`. After executing the code, the set `divisors` will now also include 2, assuming it was not already present. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` includes the integers 1, `K`, and now 2, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `K`**
