The code adds `i` to the `divisors` set. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1, and since `K` is divisible by `i`, this operation is valid. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes the integer 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `K`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a positive integer greater than 0, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` now includes the integer 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is `K`**
