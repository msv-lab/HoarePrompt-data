Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation for numbers between 0 and 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns the string representation from the `tens` list. For numbers between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of 10, it returns a combined string in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]'. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, nor does it return any output for such values, as they are not covered by the code logic.**
