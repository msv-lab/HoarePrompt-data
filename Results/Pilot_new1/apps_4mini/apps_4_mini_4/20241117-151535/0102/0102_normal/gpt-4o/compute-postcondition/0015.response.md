Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99 and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99 and is not less than 11 or greater than 19. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` (i.e., `tens[n // 10]`). If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. The function does not execute for values of `n` less than 10 or greater than 99, nor for values of `n` between 11 and 19, as these are excluded by the precondition.***
