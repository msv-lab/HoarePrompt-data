The program aims to convert an integer score between 0 and 99 into its English word representation. 

### Initial Assessment
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `s` and passes it to the function `func_1(n)`.
2. **Logic**:
   - It has lists for `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`.
   - It checks if `n` is between 0 and 9, returning the corresponding string from `ones`.
   - For numbers between 11 and 19, it uses the `teens` list.
   - For multiples of ten between 10 and 99, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list.
   - For numbers between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of ten, it combines strings from `tens` and `ones` with a hyphen.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case when `n` is exactly 10, which is missing from the `elif` conditions. The correct output for `10` should be "ten", but the current implementation will not return anything for this case since it falls outside the handled ranges.

### Output Hints
The output hints describe the function's behavior, indicating that it handles numbers between 0 and 99. However, they also mention that the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99. While the problem description specifies that `s` will be between 0 and 99, the implementation lacks a return case for `10`, which is a valid input.

### Conclusion
The program does not cover all potential cases specified in the problem description, specifically the case for `10`. Thus, it fails to meet the requirements for correctness. 

Correctness: **False**. 

### Explanation
The function does not return a correct output for the input `10`, which should output "ten". Therefore, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all possible inputs in the specified range.
