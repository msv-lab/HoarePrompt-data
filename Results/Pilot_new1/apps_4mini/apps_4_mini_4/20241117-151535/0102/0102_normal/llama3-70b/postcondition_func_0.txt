The function accepts an integer `s` from user input, which is expected to be in the range 0 to 99. It prints the English word representation of `s`. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it constructs the word using the `tens` list for the tens place and the `ones` list for the ones place, separating them with a hyphen if `s` is not a multiple of 10. Note that the function does not handle cases where `s` is less than 0 or greater than 99, and it does not return a value; it only prints the output.
