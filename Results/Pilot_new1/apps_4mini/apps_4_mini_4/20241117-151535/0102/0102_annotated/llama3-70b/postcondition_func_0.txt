The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input from the user. It converts the integer into its English word representation, handling numbers from 0 to 99. For numbers less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For numbers between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For numbers 20 and above, it constructs the word representation using the `tens` list and the `ones` list, joining them with a hyphen if necessary. However, it does not handle numbers outside the 0-99 range, which could lead to incorrect behavior or errors for inputs less than 0 or greater than 99.
