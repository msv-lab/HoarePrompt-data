The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user to input an integer. It then prints the English word representation of that integer if it is between 0 and 99. If the input number is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If the number is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For numbers 20 and above, it combines the appropriate entry from the `tens` list with the corresponding entry from the `ones` list, using a hyphen if necessary. The function does not handle inputs outside the range of 0 to 99, nor does it validate the input, which could lead to errors if the input is not a valid integer.
