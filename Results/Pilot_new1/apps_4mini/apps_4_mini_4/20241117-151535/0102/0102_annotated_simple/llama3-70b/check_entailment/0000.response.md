Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation, adhering to the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The breakdown of the logic is as follows:
1. For scores from 0 to 9, it directly uses the `ones` list to retrieve the corresponding word.
2. For scores from 10 to 19, it uses the `teens` list to get the appropriate word representation.
3. For scores from 20 to 99, it divides the score into tens and ones. It uses the `tens` list to get the word for the tens place and combines it with the `ones` list for the ones place, adding a hyphen when necessary.

The code handles all edge cases, including:
- The score of 0 (which is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred to be represented as an empty string in the `ones` list).
- The exact multiples of 10 (like 20, 30, etc.) where it correctly does not add a hyphen or the ones representation.
- The upper limit of 99 is also correctly handled.

Since all potential cases are covered and the program outputs the expected results for the given examples and edge cases, the program is correct.
