The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English word representation for values between 0 and 99. If `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not return any value. For `n` between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. For `n` between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. For `n` equal to 10 or a multiple of 10 (20, 30, ..., 90), it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list. For other values of `n` between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of 10, it returns a hyphenated string combining the tens and ones places. The function does not handle negative values or values above 99, and will not execute for such inputs.
