Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string corresponding to the tens place of `n`, which is `tens[n // 10]`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. For values of `n` less than 10 or greater than 99, the function does not execute and no return value is provided.***
