The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= `n` <= 99. 

- If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list at index `n - 10`.
- If `n` is 10 or greater but not in the range of 11 to 19, and if `n` is a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list at index `n // 10`.
- If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`.
- For values of `n` less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not execute and no return value is provided.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its English word representation based on its value, handling various cases for numbers in that range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, and returns its English word representation based on specified ranges and conditions for values between 0 and 99.**
