Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each integer is in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, taking into account the distance to the edges of the list. The function prints this maximum distance. However, it does not handle cases where the integers 1 or `n` are not present in the list, which would raise a `ValueError`. **
