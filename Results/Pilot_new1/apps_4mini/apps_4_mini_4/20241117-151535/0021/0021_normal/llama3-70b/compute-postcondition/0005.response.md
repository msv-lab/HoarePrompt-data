To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. **Understanding the Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `pos1` is the index of `1` in list `a`.
   - `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
   - `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

2. **Impact of the Code**:
   - The code computes `min_dist` as the minimum of two values:
     - `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`: This represents the distance between the indices of `1` and `n` in the list `a`, reduced by 1.
     - `n - 2`: This is the maximum possible distance between the first and last elements of the list minus 2.

3. **Calculating `min_dist`**:
   - We need the values of `pos1` and `posn` to compute `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`.
   - The value of `n` is already known and falls within the specified range.
   - Therefore, `min_dist` will be the minimum of the two calculated values.

4. **Output State**:
   - Since `min_dist` is being assigned the result of the computation, we can express the output state as follows:
   - The values of `n`, `pos1`, `posn`, and `max_dist` remain unchanged, and we now have the additional variable `min_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
