The code assigns `a` the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts each of these strings to an integer. The variable `n` is not directly affected by this operation, but it defines the length of the list `a`. The output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of integers based on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input**
