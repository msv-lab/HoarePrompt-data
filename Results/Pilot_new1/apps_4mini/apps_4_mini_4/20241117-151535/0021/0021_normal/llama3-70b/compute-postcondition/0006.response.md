To evaluate the provided code, we will analyze its impact based on the initial state.

Given:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\)
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers
- `pos1` is the index of `1` in list `a`
- `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`
- `max_dist` is calculated as \( \text{max}(\text{abs}(\text{pos1} - \text{posn}) - 1, n - 2) \)
- `min_dist` is calculated as \( \text{min}(\text{abs}(\text{pos1} - \text{posn}) - 1, n - 2) \)

The code prints the maximum of `max_dist` and \( n - 1 - \text{min_dist} \).

1. The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already defined based on the indices of `1` and `n` in the list `a`.
2. The expression \( n - 1 - \text{min_dist} \) is computed.
3. The final output is the maximum of `max_dist` and \( n - 1 - \text{min_dist} \).

Since we do not have specific values for `n`, `pos1`, `posn`, `max_dist`, and `min_dist`, we can only express the output state in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); and the output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
