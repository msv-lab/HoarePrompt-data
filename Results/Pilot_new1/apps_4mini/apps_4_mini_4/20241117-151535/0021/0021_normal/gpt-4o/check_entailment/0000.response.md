The provided program aims to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n by performing exactly one swap. 

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program identifies the positions of the minimum and maximum elements using `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`.
2. It calculates the distances from these positions to both ends of the list (index 0 and index n-1).
3. It then determines the maximum distance achievable by swapping either of the extreme elements with the minimum or maximum.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- The code assumes that both 1 and n are always present in the list. If either of them is not present, `ValueError` will be raised when trying to find their indices.
- The problem description guarantees that the input will contain a valid permutation of integers from 1 to n. However, if the input were to deviate from this (e.g., if 1 or n were missing), the code would fail.

### Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints suggest that the function calculates the maximum distance from the positions of integers 1 and n to either end of the list and prints this maximum distance. However, it does not account for the possibility of a `ValueError` if the input does not meet the specified constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where 1 or n might not be present in the list, leading to a potential runtime error. Therefore, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
