The code prints the value of `max_distance`. The variables `n`, `min_pos`, `dist4`, and `max_distance` have been defined previously, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that the value of `max_distance` is printed, but we do not have the exact numeric value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos`; `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, and the value of `max_distance` is printed.**
