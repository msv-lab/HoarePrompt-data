The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within that range. Other variables, such as `a`, are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n**
