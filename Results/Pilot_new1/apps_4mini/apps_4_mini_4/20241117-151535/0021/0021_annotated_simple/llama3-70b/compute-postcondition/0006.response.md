The code calculates the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already defined in the initial state. The `print` statement outputs the result of this calculation but does not alter the state of the variables.

Given that `max_dist` is defined as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)` and `min_dist` as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, the output will depend on the specific values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.

Since the specific values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); and the output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
