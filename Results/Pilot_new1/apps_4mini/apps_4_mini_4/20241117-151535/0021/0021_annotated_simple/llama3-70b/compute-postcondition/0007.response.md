The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the values in the list `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.**
