The function `func` accepts no parameters but reads input directly from the user. It expects the first input to be an integer `n`, which represents the size of the subsequent list. The second input is a space-separated list of `n` distinct integers that forms a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. The function then finds the positions of the integers `1` and `n` within this list, calculates the maximum and minimum distances based on these positions, and prints the maximum of these calculated distances or the distance from the end of the list.

However, the function does not handle the case where `1` or `n` might not be present in the list, which would raise a `ValueError`. The function also does not check whether the input is valid according to the constraints (e.g., `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and the list being a valid permutation). 

Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from the input, finds the positions of `1` and `n`, calculates the maximum and minimum distances based on their positions, and prints the maximum of these distances. It does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, nor does it validate the input constraints. **
