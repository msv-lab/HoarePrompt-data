Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
