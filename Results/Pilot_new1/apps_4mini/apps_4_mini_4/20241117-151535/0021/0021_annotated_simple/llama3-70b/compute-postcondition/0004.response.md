To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state. 

1. `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`. 
2. We calculate the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracting `1` from that difference.
3. We also calculate `n - 2`.
4. Finally, we find the maximum of these two computed values and assign it to `max_dist`.

Since the exact values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the relationships and possible outcomes based on the defined ranges.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing a permutation of integers from 1 to n; `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
