To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and its logic against the problem description.

The problem requires us to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) of a permutation of size n after performing exactly one swap.

### Annotations in the Code:
1. `pos1 = a.index(1)` - This finds the position of the minimum element (1).
2. `posn = a.index(n)` - This finds the position of the maximum element (n).
3. The calculation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` seems to be attempting to determine the maximum distance after a swap.

### Issues with the Code:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Distances**: The way `max_dist` and `min_dist` are calculated is not aligned with the problem requirements. The distance should be calculated based on the possible positions after a swap, not just the current positions.
2. **Misinterpretation of Problem Requirements**: The code does not consider that the positions of 1 and n can be moved to the ends of the list (0 and n-1) to maximize their distance. The approach should check the potential positions of 1 and n after a swap with elements at the extremes of the list.

### Examples Where the Code Fails:
- Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
- The expected output should be 4 (after swapping 1 with 5).
- The code calculates `max_dist` as `max(abs(0 - 4) - 1, 5 - 2)`, which results in `4`, but it does not correctly reason through the swap logic. The code does not handle the case properly when both elements are already at the ends.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the code's logic and the way it computes the distances, we can conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**
