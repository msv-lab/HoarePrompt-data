To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to consider the impact of the assignment `dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)` on the program state. 

1. The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.
2. The variable `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
3. The variable `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`.
4. The expression `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)` calculates the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`.

Since we do not have specific values for `n` and `min_pos`, we can only describe the relationship based on the constraints provided.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of integer n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos)**
