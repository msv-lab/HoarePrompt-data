To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers.
   - `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`.
   - `max_pos` is the index of integer n in `a`.
   - `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos).
   - `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`.
   - `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos).

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The code `max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)` computes the maximum value among the four distances: `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The variable `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value from the four distance variables, which are calculated based on the indices of 1 and n in the list `a`, as well as the value of `n`.

4. **Output State:**
   - The values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are derived from `max_pos`, `min_pos`, and `n`, but the specific values of these variables are not provided.
   - The output state will reflect the calculated maximum distance without specific numerical values for `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of integer n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`.**
