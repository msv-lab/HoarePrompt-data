The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means that it will take input from the user, split the input string into parts, convert each part to an integer, and then create a list from those integers. Since `a` is defined as a list of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`, the values of `a` will now be a list of `n` integers based on the input provided. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input.**
