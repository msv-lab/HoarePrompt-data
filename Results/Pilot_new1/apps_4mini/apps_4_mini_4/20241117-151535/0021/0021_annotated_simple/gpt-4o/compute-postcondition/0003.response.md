The variable `max_pos` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, we can assume that `n` exists in the list `a`. The previous values of `min_pos` and `a` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers based on user input; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in `a**
