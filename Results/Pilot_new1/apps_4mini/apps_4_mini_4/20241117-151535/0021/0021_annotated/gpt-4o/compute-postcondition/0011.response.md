Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` to the two ends of the list (index 0 and index n-1) and prints this maximum distance. However, it assumes that both 1 and `n` are present in the list `a`, which may not always be guaranteed if the input constraints are not properly enforced.**
