The code attempts to print the value of `max_distance`, but `max_distance` has not been defined in the initial state or in the provided code snippet. Since `dist3` and `dist4` are also undefined, this leads to an error. Therefore, the output state will reflect that an error occurs due to the undefined variable.

Output State: **An error occurs due to the undefined variable `max_distance`.**
