The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n.**
