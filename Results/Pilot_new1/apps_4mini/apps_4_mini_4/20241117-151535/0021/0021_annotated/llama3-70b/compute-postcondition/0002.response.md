The code assigns the value of `pos1` to the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains all integers from `1` to `n`, the integer `1` will be present in the list. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `a`, along with the newly assigned value of `pos1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
