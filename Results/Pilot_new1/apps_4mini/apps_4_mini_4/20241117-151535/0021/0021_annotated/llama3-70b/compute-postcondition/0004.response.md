To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state:

1. `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`, which contains distinct integers from `1` to `n`.
2. `posn` is defined as `n - 1`, which is the index of `n` in the list `a`.
3. The code calculates `max_dist` using the formula: `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

Now, we will break down the calculation of `max_dist`:

- The expression `abs(pos1 - posn)` computes the absolute difference between the positions of `1` and `n` in the list.
- Then, we subtract `1` from this absolute difference.
- In parallel, we compute `n - 2`.
- Finally, we take the maximum of these two values.

Since `pos1` and `posn` are derived from the list `a`, the exact numerical values of `max_dist` will depend on the specific values of `pos1` and `n`. However, we know the general formula and the relationship between the variables.

The output state will reflect the calculated value of `max_dist` along with the initial conditions of the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is `n - 1`, and `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`**.
