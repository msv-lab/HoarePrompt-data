The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n`, calculates the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, computes two distances based on these positions, and prints the maximum of a calculated distance and a derived distance. It does not handle potential input errors or cases where the integers 1 or `n` are not present in the list.
