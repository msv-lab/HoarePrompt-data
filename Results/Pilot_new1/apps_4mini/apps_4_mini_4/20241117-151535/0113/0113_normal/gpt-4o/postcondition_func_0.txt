The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `x`, which is computed as `n` multiplied by the result of dividing the multiplier by the greatest common divisor of `n` and the multiplier. The function does not handle cases where `n` is zero, which would lead to a multiplication result of zero, but it is expected that `n` is positive based on the context.
