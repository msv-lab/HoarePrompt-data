The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, the output is determined based on the values of `n` and `k`, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and it processes these inputs to produce a result based on the defined constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer), processing them to produce a result based on the defined constraints.**
