The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `n` becomes `n + 1`. The initial condition states that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and `n + 1` is not divisible by `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `n` is now `n + 1` and `n + 1` is not divisible by `x`.**
