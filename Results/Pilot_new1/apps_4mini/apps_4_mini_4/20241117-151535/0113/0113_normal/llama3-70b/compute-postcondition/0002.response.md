The value of `n` is incremented by 1, therefore the new value of `n` is `n + 1`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, and `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`, and `n` is now `n + 1`.
