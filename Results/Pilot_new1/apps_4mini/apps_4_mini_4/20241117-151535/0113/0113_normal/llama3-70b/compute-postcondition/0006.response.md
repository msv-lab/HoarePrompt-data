The value of `n` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `n` to `n + 1`. Since `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and is not divisible by `x`, the new value of `n` will still be a positive integer within the same range. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is now `n + 1` and is not divisible by `x`.

Output State: **`n` is now `n + 1` and is not divisible by `x`**
