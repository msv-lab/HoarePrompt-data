The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `input()` reads a line of input, `split()` divides it into separate values, and `map(int, ...)` converts those values into integers. The initial values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the input values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` as integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8**
