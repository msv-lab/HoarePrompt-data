The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly in its definition. However, it is implied that `n` is a positive integer constrained by the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer constrained by the condition 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior based on the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 8) indirectly, but does not return any specific output based on the provided information.**
