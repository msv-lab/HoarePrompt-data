The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). It calculates `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then increments `n` until it becomes divisible by `x`, and finally prints the resulting value of `n`. If `n` is already divisible by `x`, it remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.
