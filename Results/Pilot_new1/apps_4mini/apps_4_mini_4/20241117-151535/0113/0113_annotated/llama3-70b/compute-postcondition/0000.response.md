The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, where `input().split()` takes a string input and splits it into parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts those parts into integers. The values of `n` and `k` are determined by user input, but since the specific values are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
