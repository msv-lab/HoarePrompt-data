The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, the program returns the value of `n` multiplied by either 10, 5, 2, or 1, depending on the value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the product of `n` with a specific multiplier based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (a non-negative integer), and returns `n` multiplied by either 10, 5, 2, or 1 depending on the value of `n`.**
