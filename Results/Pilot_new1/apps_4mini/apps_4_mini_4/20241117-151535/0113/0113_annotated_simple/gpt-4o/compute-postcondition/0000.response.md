The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\), the possible values for `multiplier` can range from \(10^0 = 1\) to \(10^8 = 100000000\). The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\); `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
