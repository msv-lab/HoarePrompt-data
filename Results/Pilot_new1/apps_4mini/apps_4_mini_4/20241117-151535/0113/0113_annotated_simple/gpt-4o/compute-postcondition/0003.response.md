The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). After executing the function body, it returns the value of `x`, which is calculated based on the formula \(x = n \times \left(\frac{multiplier}{\text{math.gcd}(n, multiplier)}\right)\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a calculated value based on `n` and a `multiplier` that is derived from `k` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `n` and the `multiplier`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns a calculated value based on `n` and a derived `multiplier` using the greatest common divisor.**
