According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, as specified by the range function. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, indicating that its value is not important for the loop body.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have executed `n` times, but since we are not modifying any specific state within the loop, no additional states need to be adjusted regarding the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
