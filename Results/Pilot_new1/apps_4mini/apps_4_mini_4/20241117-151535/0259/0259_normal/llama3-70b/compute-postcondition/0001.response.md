The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the state of `n` and `t` remains the same. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `buses` without affecting `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list**
