According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, and it is currently in its last iteration. The loop variable `_` is not used, but it indicates that the loop has run `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. 

Since the loop has completed its last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased by 1. Therefore, it needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101. The other states (`t` and `buses`) do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly related to the loop's execution count.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)] appended with the new tuple (s, d)**
