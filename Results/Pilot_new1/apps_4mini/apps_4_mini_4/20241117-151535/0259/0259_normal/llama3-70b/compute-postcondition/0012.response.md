Output State: **`buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of integers (s, d) where each tuple is derived from user input. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `buses` remains an empty list. If `n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` will contain exactly `n` tuples after the loop, with each tuple representing the respective inputs (s, d).**
