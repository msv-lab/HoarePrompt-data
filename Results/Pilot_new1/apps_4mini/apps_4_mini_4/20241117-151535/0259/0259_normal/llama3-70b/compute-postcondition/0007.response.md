The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers, and the current state of `buses` will be updated to include this new tuple. The previous values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list of `buses` along with the unchanged values of `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)] appended with the new tuple (s, d)**
