According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list contains at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Given that `buses` is a list of `n` tuples, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1. At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, and `(s, d)` should be the first tuple in the list.

State: **`buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the list**
