According to the code, the loop can execute again if the current iteration count (represented by the underscore `_`) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 101. Since the loop has been iterating for `_` times, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n`. 

If we denote the current iteration count as `_`, after the last iteration, `_` would be equal to the number of times the loop has executed so far. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be adjusted to be equal to the number of completed iterations, which would be `_ + 1`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `_` is less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than `_`. 

Since `n` is already a positive integer that is at least 1, we can adjust it to be greater than the current count of iterations. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than `_ + 1, t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `buses` is updated to include an additional tuple (s, d)**
