`buses` is an empty list initially. The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers, and they will be added to the list as a tuple. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `buses` list containing one tuple of `(s, d)`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is [(s, d)], `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
