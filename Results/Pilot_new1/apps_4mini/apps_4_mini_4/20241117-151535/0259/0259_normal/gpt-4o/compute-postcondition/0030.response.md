The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables (`s_i`, `d_i`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is 0**
