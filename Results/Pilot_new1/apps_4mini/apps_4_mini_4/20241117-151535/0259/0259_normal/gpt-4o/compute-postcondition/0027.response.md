According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented to `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Since `i` is now `i + 1`, we need to adjust the condition for `n`. No other states need to be adjusted since `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged at the beginning of the next iteration.

State: **`s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
