Postcondition: ***`wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, thus `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. This ensures that `min_wait_time` reflects the shortest wait time encountered, and `chosen_route` indicates the corresponding bus route index. All relevant cases, including when `wait_time` is less than, equal to, or greater than `min_wait_time`, are addressed, ensuring that the minimum wait time is accurately tracked.***
