Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the bus routes relative to `t`, and `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route that provides this minimum wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all bus routes have starting times less than `t`, `min_wait_time` will reflect the calculated wait time for each route, and `chosen_route` will indicate the route with the shortest wait time. If all routes have starting times greater than `t`, `min_wait_time` will reflect the wait time until the next bus, and `chosen_route` will be set accordingly.**
