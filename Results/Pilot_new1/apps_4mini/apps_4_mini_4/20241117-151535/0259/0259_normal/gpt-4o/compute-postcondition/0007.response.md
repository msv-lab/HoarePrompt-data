Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, the first element `s_i` of the first tuple in `bus_routes` is less than `t`, and the difference (t - s_i) is divisible by d_i (i.e., (t - s_i) % d_i == 0).***
