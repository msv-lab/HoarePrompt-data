The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `chosen_route` becomes 0 + 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.**
