The variable `wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is the first element of the first tuple in `bus_routes` and `t` is a positive integer greater than `s_i`, we can derive the values for `wait_time`.

Since it is specified that `(t - s_i) % d_i â‰  0`, it means that `t` is not aligned with the schedule defined by `d_i`, and thus there is a wait time that needs to be computed.

The output state will reflect the calculated `wait_time` based on the values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. However, since the exact values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided, we will express `wait_time` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, the first element `s_i` of the first tuple in `bus_routes` is less than `t`, and it is not the case that `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
