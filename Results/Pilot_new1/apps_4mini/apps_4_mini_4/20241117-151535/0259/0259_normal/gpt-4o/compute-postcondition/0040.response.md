The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\). The parameter `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers \(s_i\) and \(d_i\) such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\). After executing the function body, it returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time, which is stored in `chosen_route`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a positive integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of bus routes. It returns the index of the bus route that provides the minimum wait time.**
