The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of bus routes, constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `t` is also a positive integer that indicates the number of queries, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\). Additionally, for each bus route, there are two parameters `s_i` and `d_i`, which are positive integers representing the start and destination of the bus routes, constrained such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\).

The function processes the bus routes and queries based on the provided parameters. The specific output of the function is not described in the provided information, but it is implied that the function will return results based on the bus routes and queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n (the number of bus routes) and t (the number of queries), and processes bus routes defined by pairs of positive integers (s_i, d_i) for each route.**
