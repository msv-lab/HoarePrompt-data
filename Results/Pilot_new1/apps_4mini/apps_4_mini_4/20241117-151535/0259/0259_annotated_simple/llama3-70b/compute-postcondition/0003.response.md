The variables `s` and `d` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which takes user input and splits it into two parts, converting them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `s` and `d` based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is an empty list, and `s` and `d` are input integers.**
