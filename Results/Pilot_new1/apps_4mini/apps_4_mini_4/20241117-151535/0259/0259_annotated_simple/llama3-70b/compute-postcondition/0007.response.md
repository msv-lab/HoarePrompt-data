The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state specifies that `buses` already contains one tuple, so after the execution, `buses` will contain two tuples: the original one and the newly added one. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated content of the `buses` list.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
