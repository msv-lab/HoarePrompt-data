The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0, we can calculate `wait_time`. The specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided, but we know that `wait_time` will be a positive integer due to the conditions given.

Since `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and other variables are not affected by this assignment, the output state will reflect the calculated `wait_time` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `wait_time` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is not equal to 0.**
