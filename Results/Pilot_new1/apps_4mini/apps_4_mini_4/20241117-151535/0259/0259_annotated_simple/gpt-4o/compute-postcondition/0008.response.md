The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`, the value of `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.
