The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This means that `min_wait_time` is now set to a value that is greater than any finite number. The initial states of the other variables (`n` and `t`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**
