According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and we need to determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), and `i` is the index of the current iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

If we denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i`, then for the loop to execute again, `i` must be adjusted to `i + 1`. Thus, the new state should reflect this increment.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`, `i` is `i + 1`**
