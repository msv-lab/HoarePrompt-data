The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing a time parameter, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains the start time and frequency of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for each bus route from time `t` and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating no available routes. If all buses have the same wait time, it will return the index of the first bus route with that wait time.
