The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100).
- `t` is a positive integer representing a time parameter (1 <= t <= 100000).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i`, representing the start and destination of each bus route (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000).

After executing the function body, it returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time, which is stored in the variable `chosen_route`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, a time parameter, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time parameter), and bus_routes (list of bus route tuples), and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time.**
