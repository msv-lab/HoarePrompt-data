To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: The program reads `n` (number of bus routes) and `t` (time Serval arrives at the station). Then it reads `n` pairs of integers, each representing the first bus arrival time `s_i` and the interval `d_i` for each bus route.
2. **Output**: The program should output the index of the bus route that Serval will take. If multiple buses arrive at the same time, any of them can be chosen.

### Program Logic
- The program calculates the time until the next bus for each route after Serval arrives.
- It uses the formula `(t - s) % d` to determine the wait time for each bus route, which is incorrect. This calculation does not correctly account for the scenario where `t < s`, meaning Serval arrives before the first bus of that route.
- The program is supposed to find the earliest bus Serval can catch, but the logic fails in cases where the first bus has not yet arrived.

### Test Case Analysis
1. **Case where `t < s`**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2 2
     6 4
     9 5
     ```
   - Expected output: The first bus of the first route arrives at 6, and the first bus of the second route arrives at 9. Serval cannot catch any bus, so the output should be `1` (the first bus route).
   - The program will output `1`, which is incorrect because Serval cannot catch any bus.

2. **Case where `t = s`**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1 5
     5 2
     ```
   - Expected output: Serval arrives exactly when the first bus arrives, so the output should be `1`.
   - The program will correctly output `1`.

3. **Case where `t` is exactly between two bus arrivals**:
   - Input:
     ```
     1 5
     3 3
     ```
   - Expected output: The first bus arrives at 3, and the second at 6. Serval can take the first bus, so the output should be `1`.
   - The program will correctly output `1`.

### Conclusion
The program fails to handle the case where `t < s`, which is a valid scenario according to the problem description. Since there is at least one input case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
