The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `chosen_route` will be 0 + 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`**.
