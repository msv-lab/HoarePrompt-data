The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, an integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains the start time and frequency of a bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on their start times and frequencies, returning the index (1-based) of the bus route that has the shortest wait time. If there are no bus routes (i.e., `n` is 0), it returns -1, indicating that no bus route is available.
