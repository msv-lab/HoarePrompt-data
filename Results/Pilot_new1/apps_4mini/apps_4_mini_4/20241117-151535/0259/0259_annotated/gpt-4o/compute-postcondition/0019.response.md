The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Here, `s_i` comes from `bus_routes[i]` and `t` is a positive integer. Since `n` is greater than `n` (which is a logical inconsistency and likely a typo), we will focus on the values of `s_i` and `t`. Since `t` is positive, `wait_time` will be calculated as `s_i - t`. The specific values of `s_i` and `wait_time` depend on the current values assigned in `bus_routes[i]`, but we know that `wait_time` will reflect the difference between `s_i` and the positive integer `t`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
