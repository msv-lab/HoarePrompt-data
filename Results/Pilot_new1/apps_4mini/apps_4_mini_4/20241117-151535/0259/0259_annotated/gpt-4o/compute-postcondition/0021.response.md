The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are used in this calculation, where `t` is a positive integer, and `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. The exact numerical values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not provided, but we know `n` is greater than `n`, which does not affect the calculation. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
