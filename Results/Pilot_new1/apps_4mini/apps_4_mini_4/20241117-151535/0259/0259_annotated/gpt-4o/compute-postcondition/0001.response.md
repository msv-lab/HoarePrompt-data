The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `-1`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, so the output state reflects the new value of `chosen_route` while keeping the other variables unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1**
