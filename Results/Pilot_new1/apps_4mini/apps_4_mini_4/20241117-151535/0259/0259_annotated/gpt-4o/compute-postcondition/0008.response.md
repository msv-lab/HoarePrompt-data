The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference `(t - s_i)` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.
