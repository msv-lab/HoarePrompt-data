According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` will start from 0 and will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`. 

Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1, but these values do not affect the loop's ability to execute. The only necessary adjustments relate to `i`, which will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
