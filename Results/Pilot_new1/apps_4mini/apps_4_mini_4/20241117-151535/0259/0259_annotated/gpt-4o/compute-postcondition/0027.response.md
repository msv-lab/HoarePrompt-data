According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the condition `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `n`, which is not possible. This suggests that `n` should be adjusted to a specific value that is greater than `i` for the loop to execute again.

Since `i` is the current index of the loop and needs to be incremented for the next iteration, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, we can set `i` to its next value, which would be `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i + 1]`**
