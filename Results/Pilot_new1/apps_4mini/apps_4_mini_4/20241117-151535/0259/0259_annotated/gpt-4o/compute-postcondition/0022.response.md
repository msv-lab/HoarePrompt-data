Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `n`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`.***
