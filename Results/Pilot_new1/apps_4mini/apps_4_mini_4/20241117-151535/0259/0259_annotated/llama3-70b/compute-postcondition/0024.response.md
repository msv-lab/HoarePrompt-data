The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, the value of `ans` becomes 1 + 1, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is 2.

Output State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 1, `n` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `min_time` is equal to `time`, `ans` is 2**
