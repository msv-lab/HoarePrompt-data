The variables `n` and `t` are assigned the values obtained from `input`, which retrieves a line of input and splits it into two parts. Then, `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers. The ranges for `n` and `t` are already given in the initial state, so they will be positive integers within the specified limits. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000**
