The code assigns values to `s` and `d` by taking input and splitting it into two integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `s` and `d` are not defined until this input operation occurs. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` and `d` are now assigned values from the input, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is equal to n, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
