The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers. The initial state indicates that `buses` contains two tuples, and the other variables (`n`, `t`, and `_`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated content of `buses` while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 101, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` contains three tuples: the original two tuples and the new tuple (s, d), `_` is equal to n, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
