The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input, which is split into two parts and converted to integers. The initial state of `n`, `t`, and `buses` is not affected by this code. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific values of `s` and `d` without input. The output state reflects that `s` and `d` have been assigned input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, and `s`, `d` are assigned input integers.**
