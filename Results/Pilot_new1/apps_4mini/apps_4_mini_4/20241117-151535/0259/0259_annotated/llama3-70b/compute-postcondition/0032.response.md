Output State: **If `buses` contains at least one tuple, `min_time` will be the minimum of all calculated `time` values, and `ans` will be the index (1-based) of the tuple that produced this minimum time. If `buses` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1.**
