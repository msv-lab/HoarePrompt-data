According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`, which represents the number of elements in `buses`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, meaning there are at least 2 tuples in total (since `i` starts at 0). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and we need to ensure that `buses` contains at least 3 tuples. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`buses` contains at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 2. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, `min_time` remains unchanged and `ans` remains -1.**
