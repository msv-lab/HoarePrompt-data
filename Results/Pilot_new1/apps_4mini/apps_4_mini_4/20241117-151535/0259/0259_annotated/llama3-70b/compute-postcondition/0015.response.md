According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` variable. The loop will iterate over the `buses` list, which contains `n` tuples of the form (s, d). For the loop to execute, `buses` must contain at least one tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will represent the index of the current tuple being processed. 

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `buses` has at least one tuple, and we can initialize `i` to 0, which represents the index of the first tuple in the list. 

State: **`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1**
