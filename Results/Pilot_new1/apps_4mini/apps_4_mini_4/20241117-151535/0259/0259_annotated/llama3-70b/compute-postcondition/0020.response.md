Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `n` is unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `min_time` is a positive value, and `ans` is -1. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 1. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` remains unchanged and `ans` remains -1.***
