Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If no integers in the range satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` will also remain 0. The integers `l` and `r` satisfy the condition 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `num` will take on values from `l` to `r` during the loop execution.**
