Postcondition: ***`total_sum` is 0 initially, and if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` becomes `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(l + 1) % MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, `total_sum` remains 0. The integers `l` and `r` satisfy the condition 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `num` is defined as `l + 1`.***
