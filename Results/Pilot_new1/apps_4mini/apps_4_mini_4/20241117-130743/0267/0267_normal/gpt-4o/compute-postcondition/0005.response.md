According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l`, and since `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again.

In the next iteration, `num` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `l + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `num` is adjusted to `l + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `total_sum` is only affected if `func_1(num, k)` is called in the loop body, and we have no information about the value of `k` or the result of `func_1(num, k)` from the previous iteration.

State: **`total_sum` is 0 initially, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `num` is `l + 1`**
