The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this line of code, as it only assigns a value to `total_sum`. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the initialization of `total_sum` while retaining the previous values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0**
