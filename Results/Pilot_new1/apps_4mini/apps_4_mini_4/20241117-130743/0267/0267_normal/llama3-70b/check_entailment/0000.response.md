To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the problem description, the code, and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits and return this sum modulo `998244353`. 

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - It calls the `count` function for `r` and `l - 1` and calculates the difference.
   - The result is taken modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - It handles the case where `k` is `0` by returning `0`, which is correct since no numbers can have `0` different digits.
   - It checks if `(n, k)` is already computed and stored in `dp` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If `n < 10 ** k`, it simply returns `n`. This seems to indicate that if `n` is less than a certain threshold, it counts all numbers up to `n` since they can all be formed with at most `k` digits.
   - The logic for when `n >= 10 ** k` involves more complex calculations that seem to attempt to count valid numbers based on the digits used.

### Output Hints
- The output hints describe the behavior of both functions but do not clarify the exact logic of the `count` function.
- They mention that edge cases related to the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not explicitly handled in the code.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues
1. **When `k = 1`**: The function should count only numbers like `1, 2, ..., 9`, `11, 22, ..., 99`, etc. It should not include numbers with more than one unique digit.
2. **Large Values of `l` and `r`**: Given the constraints where `l` and `r` can be as large as `10^18`, performance and overflow issues could arise if not handled properly.
3. **Handling of Numbers with Exactly `k` Different Digits**: The logic in `count` must ensure it correctly sums numbers that only contain digits from a set of size `k`.

### Conclusion
The code does not explicitly handle all edge cases, especially when `k` is small compared to the range of numbers provided by `l` and `r`. The hints indicate that the logic for counting valid numbers is not sufficiently detailed, leading to potential oversights in edge cases.

Given that the output hints suggest that edge cases related to the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not explicitly handled, it raises concerns about the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may not correctly calculate the sum for all potential cases, particularly for cases where `k` is small and `l` and `r` cover a wide range of numbers. For instance, with `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 1`, the expected output should only include numbers like `11, 22, 33, 44`, but the logic in `count` may not correctly filter out numbers with more than one unique digit.
