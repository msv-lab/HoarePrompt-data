The function `count` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0 and the pair `(n, k)` exists in the `dp` dictionary, it returns the corresponding value. If `(n, k)` is not in `dp`, it calculates a value based on the conditions involving `n` and `k`, updates `dp[n, k]`, and returns this value. The calculations involve checking if `n` is less than `10
