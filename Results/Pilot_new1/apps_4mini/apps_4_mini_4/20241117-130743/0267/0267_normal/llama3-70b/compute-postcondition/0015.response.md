The variable `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the value calculated from the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The value of `i` is `k`, which is between 2 and 10, and `n` is at least `10 ** k`. The specific values of `l`, `r`, and `n` do not affect the calculation of `dp[n, k]` directly, but they provide context for the constraints.

The calculation involves:
1. Computing `10 ** (i - 1)`, which equals `10 ** (k - 1)`.
2. Computing `10 ** (k - i)`, which equals `10 ** (k - k) = 10 ** 0 = 1`.
3. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 1) * (1 - 10 ** (k - 1))`.

The output state reflects that `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the given formula. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is between 2 and 10, `n` is at least 10^k, and `dp[n, k]` is updated.**
