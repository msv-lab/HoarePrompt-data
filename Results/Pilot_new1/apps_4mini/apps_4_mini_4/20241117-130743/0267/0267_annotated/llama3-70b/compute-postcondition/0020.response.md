Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair (n, k) exists in the data structure `dp`, the function returns the value associated with (n, k). If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is updated to 9, and for `k` at least 2, it is further modified by the calculations involving powers of 10, and finally, `dp[n, k]` is taken modulo `MOD`. In the case where `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` remains 9.***
