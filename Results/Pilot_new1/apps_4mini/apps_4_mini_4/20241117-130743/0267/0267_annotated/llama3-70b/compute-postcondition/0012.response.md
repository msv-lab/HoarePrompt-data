According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i < k`, which means the maximum value of `i` in the next iteration can be `k - 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently `1`, and since `k` is greater than or equal to `2`, the loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. After the last iteration, `i` will increment to `2`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `2`.

No other states need to be adjusted since the values of `l`, `r`, `k`, `n`, and `dp[n, k]` do not affect the continuation of the loop beyond the value of `i`.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10; `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`; `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10, `i` is 2**
