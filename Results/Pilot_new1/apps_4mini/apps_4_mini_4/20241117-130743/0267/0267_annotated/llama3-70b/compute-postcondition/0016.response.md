According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates with `i` starting from 1 up to `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has not been specified, but since the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k - 1`, we need to ensure that the conditions are set correctly for the next iteration.

Given that the loop starts with `i = 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. If we assume that `i` was `k - 2` at the end of the last iteration, then `k` must remain unchanged, and `i` should be incremented to `k - 1` for the next iteration.

However, since we do not have the exact value of `i` at the end of the last iteration, we can only infer that `k` must be greater than 1 to allow for at least one iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustments would be:
- `i` should be set to 1 for the next iteration.
- `k` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 90`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
