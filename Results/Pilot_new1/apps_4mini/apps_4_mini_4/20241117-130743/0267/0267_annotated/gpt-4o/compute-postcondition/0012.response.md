Output State: **If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop will execute for each integer `num` in the range from `l` to `r`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true for any `num`, `total_sum` will be updated to the sum of those `num` values modulo `MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false for all `num`, `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. Additionally, if `l` equals `r`, the loop executes only once for that single value.**
