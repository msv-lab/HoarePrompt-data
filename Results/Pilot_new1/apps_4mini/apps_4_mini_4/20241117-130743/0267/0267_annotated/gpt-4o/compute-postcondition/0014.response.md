The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10\). After executing the function, it returns the sum of integers in the range from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition defined by `func_1(num, k)` modulo a constant `MOD`. If no integers satisfy this condition or if `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers within that range that meet a specific condition, or 0 if no such integers exist or if the range is invalid.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l, r, and k, and returns the sum of integers in the range from l to r that satisfy func_1(num, k) modulo MOD, or 0 if none satisfy the condition or if l > r.**
