According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `num` ranging from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r`, since the loop iterates from `l` to `r + 1`, inclusive of `l` and `r`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented to `r + 1`, which is the next value in the range. Therefore, the state of `num` needs to be adjusted to `r + 1`. The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged, as they do not need to be modified for the loop to execute again.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `r + 1`**
