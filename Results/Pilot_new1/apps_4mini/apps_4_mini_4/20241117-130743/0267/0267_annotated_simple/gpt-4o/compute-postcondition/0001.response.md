According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`, which is guaranteed by the condition provided (1 <= l <= r < 10^18). 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take on values starting from `l` and will increment by 1 until it reaches `r`. Therefore, the initial value of `num` before the first iteration of the loop should be `l`. 

Given that `total_sum` is initialized to 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop but will be updated during the loop's iterations.

To summarize, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
- `num` should be initialized to `l`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
