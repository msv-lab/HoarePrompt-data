According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over `num` from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, and `r` is at least `l`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `num` must be incremented to the next value in the range. Since the loop starts at `l` and continues until `r`, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be `r + 1` (the next value after `r`). Therefore, we need to adjust the state so that `num` is set to `r + 1`.

However, since `num` is used in the loop condition and is determined by the `range(l, r + 1)`, it cannot exceed `r + 1`. Thus, we need to ensure that `l` remains the same, `r` is still at least `l`, and `num` needs to be adjusted to `r + 1`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `num` is `r + 1`.

The values of `k` and `total_sum` do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, as they are independent of the loop continuation condition.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `r + 1`**
