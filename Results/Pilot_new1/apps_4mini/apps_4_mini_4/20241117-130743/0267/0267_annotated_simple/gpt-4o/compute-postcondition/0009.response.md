To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the existing variables based on the initial state.

1. The initial values are:
   - `total_sum` is 0
   - `num` is `r + 1`
   - `MOD` is assumed to be a predefined constant (not specified in the initial state).

2. The code `total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD` will execute as follows:
   - `total_sum` starts at 0.
   - `num` is equal to `r + 1`, but since the exact value of `r` is not provided, we can only express `num` in terms of `r`.
   - The new value of `total_sum` will be calculated as `(0 + (r + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(r + 1) % MOD`.

3. The output state will reflect the new value of `total_sum` and the unchanged values of `l`, `r`, and `k`, along with the expression for `num`.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is (r + 1) % MOD, `num` is r + 1**
