Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + (r + 1)) % MOD`, where `num` is `r + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains unchanged at 0.***
