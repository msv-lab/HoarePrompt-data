The variable `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is `r + 1`, and `total_sum` starts at 0. Therefore, after the execution, `total_sum` will be `(0 + (r + 1)) % MOD`, which simplifies to `(r + 1) % MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is (r + 1) % MOD, `num` is `r + 1`**
