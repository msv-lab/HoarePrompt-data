According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop iterates for `i` in the range from 1 to `k - 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. However, since the loop only runs while `i` is less than `k`, `i` must be adjusted to be equal to 3, and `k` must remain 3 for the loop to terminate correctly.

Therefore, to allow for one more execution, the state needs to reflect that `i` is now 3, which is not less than `k`. Hence, we need to adjust `i` to be 3, while keeping `k` as 3.

State: **`dp[n, k]` is -720, `k` is 3, `i` is 3**
