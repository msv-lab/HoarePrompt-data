According to the code, the loop iterates over a range defined by `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `k` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, which is still less than `k`. 

No other state needs to be adjusted since `l`, `r`, `n`, and `dp[n, k]` do not impact the loop's execution condition here.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 90, `i` is 2**
