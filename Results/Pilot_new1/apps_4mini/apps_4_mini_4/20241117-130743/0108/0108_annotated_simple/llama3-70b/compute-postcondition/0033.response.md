The code snippet replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that is one position after `char` in the Unicode table. Since `s` is updated to include `char`, it means `char` is present in `s`. The variable `res` is also updated to include `char`, but it is not affected by this replacement operation.

The impact of the code is that the first occurrence of `char` in `s` will be replaced with the next character in the Unicode sequence. The new state of `s` will reflect this change, while `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated to reflect the replacement of `char` with the next character, and `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is updated to reflect the replacement of `char` with the next character, and `res` remains unchanged.**
