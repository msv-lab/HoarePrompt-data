Postcondition: ***If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z' and `res` is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in the order of the alphabet, covering all letters from 'a' to 'z', with `s` modified to remove those characters, then the function prints `res`. If `s` contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z' but does not include all letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` will not be equal to the concatenation of all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the function prints -1. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` remains empty, and `s` is unchanged, resulting in the function printing -1.***
