The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. This action does not modify the values of the variables `s` and `res`, which retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state is that `s` still contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z', `res` is not equal to the concatenation of all characters from 'a' to 'z', and the function prints `-1`.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one character from 'a' to 'z', `res` is not equal to the concatenation of all characters from 'a' to 'z', and the function prints -1**
