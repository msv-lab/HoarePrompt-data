The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `char`, which means `char` is appended to `res`. The previous value of `s` is not directly affected, but `res` is updated to include `char`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `res`.

Output State: **`s` is updated to include `char`, and `res` is updated to include `char`**
