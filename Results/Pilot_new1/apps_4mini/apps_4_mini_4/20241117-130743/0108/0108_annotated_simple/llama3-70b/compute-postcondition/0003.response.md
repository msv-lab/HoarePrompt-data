According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `alphabet` string, which consists of the lowercase English letters. The loop will execute regardless of the contents of `s`, as it is not dependent on `s` for the loop to run. 

However, we need to consider the state of the variables at the start of the loop. Since `char` will take on each character from `alphabet` starting from 'a', we can initialize `char` to the first character in `alphabet`, which is 'a'. 

The variable `res` is an empty string before the loop starts, and it will be used within the loop body, but its initial state does not affect the execution of the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `char` should be initialized to 'a' (the first character in `alphabet`).

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
