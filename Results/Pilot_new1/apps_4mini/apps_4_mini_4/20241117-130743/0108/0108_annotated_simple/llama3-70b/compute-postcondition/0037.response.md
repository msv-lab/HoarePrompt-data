Output State: **If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z', then `res` is the concatenation of all characters found in `s` in the order of the alphabet until the first character not found in `s`, and `s` will be modified accordingly by replacing those characters. If `s` does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop doesn't execute and `res` remains empty. If `s` contains characters beyond 'z', those will not affect the loop since it only checks for characters from 'a' to 'z'. If `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z' but does not contain the current `char`, the loop will terminate early for that character, and `res` will remain unchanged for that iteration. In cases where `s` consists solely of characters that are not in the range 'a' to 'z', `res` will be empty and `s` will remain unchanged.**
