Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If it does, the function prints the entire alphabet; if it does not, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, and it is designed to handle input strings of lengths from 1 to 100,000. If the input string is empty, the function will print -1 since it cannot contain the alphabet. **
