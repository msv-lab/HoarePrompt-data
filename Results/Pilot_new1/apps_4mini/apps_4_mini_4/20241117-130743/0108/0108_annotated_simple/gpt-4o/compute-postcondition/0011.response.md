The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is either 0 or 1.
