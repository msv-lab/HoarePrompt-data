According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `alphabet`, which consists of the lowercase English letters. The loop will execute regardless of the contents of the string `s`, since it is not directly affecting the execution of the loop. 

However, the loop will iterate over all 26 characters in `alphabet`, starting with `char` being the first character 'a'. Since `res` is an empty string at the start, it will remain empty until modified within the loop body.

To summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

- The loop will execute as long as `alphabet` is defined, which it is.
- `char` will start at 'a' in the first iteration.
- `s` does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but it is present in the state.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
