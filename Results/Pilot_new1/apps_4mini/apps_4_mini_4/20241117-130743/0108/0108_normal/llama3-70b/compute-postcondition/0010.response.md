The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'ab', and `char` is 'b', so after execution, `res` becomes 'abb'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` contains at least one 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
