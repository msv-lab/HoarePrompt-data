The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1` to the console. The values of `s` and `res` remain unchanged, and since `res` does not contain all 26 letters of the alphabet, that condition still holds. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `s` and `res`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `res` is an empty string, `res` does not contain all 26 letters of the alphabet, and the function prints -1**
