The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that is one position after `char` in the ASCII table. The variable `s` remains unchanged except for this replacement. The initial state indicates that `char` is present in `s`, so the replacement will be successful. 

Assuming `char` is a valid character in `s`, let's denote the new character as `new_char`, which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The updated string `s` will have `new_char` in place of the first occurrence of `char`.

The output state reflects the updated string `s` and remains unchanged for `res`, which still includes `char`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with `new_char`, and `char` is in `s`**
