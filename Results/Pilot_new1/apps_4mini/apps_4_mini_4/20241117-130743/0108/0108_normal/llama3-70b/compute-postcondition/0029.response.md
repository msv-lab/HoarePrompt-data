The value of `res` is incremented by the value of `char`, which is in `s`. The exact values of `res` and `char` are not provided, but since `char` is in `s`, it can be assumed that `char` is a valid character from the string `s`. The state of `s` and `res` is affected as `res` is updated to include `char`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated to include `char`, `s` remains the same, and `char` is in `s`.

Output State: **`res` is updated to include `char`, `s` remains the same, and `char` is in `s**
