The value of `res` is updated by appending `char`, which is 'b'. Since `res` was previously updated to include 'b', it will now have an additional 'b' appended to it. The state of `s` and `char` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`s` is 'abc', `char` is 'b', `res` is updated by appending 'b'**
