The statement `res += char` appends the value of `char` to `res`. The initial state mentions that `s` contains 'a', and `char` is defined as the next character in the alphabet after the last character found in `s`. Since the last character in `s` is 'a', the next character in the alphabet is 'b'. Therefore, `char` is 'b'. 

After executing the code, `res` will have 'b' added to it. The previous state of `res` is not provided, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that 'b' will be appended to whatever `res` was before.

Output State: **`s` contains 'a'; `char` is 'b'; `res` is updated by appending 'b'**
