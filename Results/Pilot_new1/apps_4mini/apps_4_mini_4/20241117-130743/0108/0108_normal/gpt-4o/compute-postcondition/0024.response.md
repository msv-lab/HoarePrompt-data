Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and checks if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z') in order. If `s` contains all letters in the correct sequence, it prints the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, and it handles cases where `s` is empty or does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z' by printing -1. **
