The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. This does not change the values of any variables, as it simply displays the number. The values of `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `j` is less than 26, and `i` is the length of `s`, and the function prints -1.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is less than 26, `i` is the length of `s`, and the function prints -1**
