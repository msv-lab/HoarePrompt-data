The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 1, so after execution, `i` becomes 2. The states of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the match condition.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is either 0, 1, or 2**
