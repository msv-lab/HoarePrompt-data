Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters of length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; if `s[1]` matches `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `j` being either 1 or 2); otherwise, `j` remains unchanged at its initial value of 0 or 1.***
