Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the requirement of transforming the input string into a version that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. Specifically, it only checks if the characters of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' appear in the input string in order but does not account for the ability to replace characters to achieve this.

For example, consider the input string "abcxyz". The program would find that 'a', 'b', and 'c' are present in the correct order but would fail to replace 'x', 'y', and 'z' to achieve the necessary characters 'd', 'e', 'f', etc. to complete the sequence. The expected output should be "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", but the program would output "-1", which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements in all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
