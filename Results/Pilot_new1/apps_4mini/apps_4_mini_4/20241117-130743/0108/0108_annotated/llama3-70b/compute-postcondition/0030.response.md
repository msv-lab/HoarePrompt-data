The code snippet updates the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of the character `char` with the next character in the ASCII sequence (which is obtained by adding 1 to the ASCII value of `char`). The variable `res` remains unchanged in this operation. 

The previous values of the affected variables are:
- `s` contains the new `char`
- `char` is a specific character that is being replaced in `s`

After executing the line of code, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. 

Therefore, the output state is: `res` is updated by appending the new `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`.

Output State: **`res` is updated by appending the new `char`, `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by `chr(ord(char) + 1)`**
