Postcondition: ***`res` contains the occurrences of each character from 'a' to the last character found in `s`, in the order they appear in `s`, but the length of `res` is less than 26. `s` contains only characters greater than the last character found in `s`, or `s` is unchanged if it contains no lowercase letters. If `s` is empty or contains no lowercase letters, `res` remains an empty string and `s` remains unchanged.***
