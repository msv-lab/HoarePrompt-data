The value of `s` is updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The previous state indicates that `s` contains the character that is the next one in the ASCII sequence after `char`. The variable `res` is not directly affected by this operation, so we only need to reflect the change in `s`.

Output State: **`res` is updated by appending `char`; `s` is updated by replacing `char` with the next ASCII character**
