The value of `res` is updated by appending the value of `char` to it. The specific value of `char` is contained in `s`, which is a new character. Therefore, the output state reflects that `res` has been updated with the new character from `s`. The exact values of `res` and `s` are not specified, so we note that `res` is updated to include `char`. 

Output State: **`res` is updated by appending the new `char`, `s` contains the new `char`**
