The variable `res` is initialized as an empty string. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, as `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase English letters and `alphabet` remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `res`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `res` is an empty string**
