The value of `res` is incremented by `char`, which is the next character in `alphabet`. The previous values of `s` and `res` remain unchanged, while `char` contributes to the new value of `res`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` remains unchanged, `res` is updated to include `char`, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet`.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `res` is updated to include `char`, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet**.
