Output State: **`if char is 'a' and 'a' is in s then res contains all occurrences of 'a' followed by occurrences of 'b', 'c', ..., up to the last character found in s before it is no longer in the string. At the end of the loop, s will contain only characters that are greater than the last character found, and char will be the first character that is not in the modified s. If 'a' is not in s initially, the loop does not execute, and res remains an empty string while s remains unchanged.`**
