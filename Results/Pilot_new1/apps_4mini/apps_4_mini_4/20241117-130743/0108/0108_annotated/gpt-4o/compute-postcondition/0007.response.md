The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide the previous value of `i`, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `i`. The variable `j` remains unchanged since the code only affects `i`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`; `i` is increased by 1.
