Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. If the first character of `s` is equal to the first character of `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, resulting in `j` being 1. If the first character of `s` does not match the first character of `target`, `j` remains 0. Thus, after execution, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`.***
