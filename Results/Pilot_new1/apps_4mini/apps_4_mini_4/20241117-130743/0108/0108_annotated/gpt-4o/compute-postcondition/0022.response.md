Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order, then `j` is 26 and `i` equals the length of `s`, but a NameError occurs due to the undefined variable `target`. If `s` is shorter than 26 characters or does not contain all letters in order, then `j` is less than 26, `i` equals len(s), and the function prints -1. If `s` is empty, the loop doesn't execute, and both `j` and `i` remain 0, leading to the printing of -1.***
