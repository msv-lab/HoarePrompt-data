To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop. The loop will continue as long as both `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len` are true.

1. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`. After the increment, `i` now becomes `i + 1`, which means `i` is currently less than `len(s)`. This condition for `i` is satisfied for the next iteration.

2. The second condition is `j < target_len`. Since `j` is less than `target_len` and remains unchanged, this condition is also satisfied for the next iteration.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the loop can execute one more time without needing to adjust any states.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is less than `len(s)`, `j` is less than `target_len`**
