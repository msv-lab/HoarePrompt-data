According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `len(s)`, `j`, and `target_len`. The loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `len(s)`, and since `i` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that it remains less than `len(s)`. Therefore, `len(s)` must be greater than the current value of `i`.

Additionally, since `j` can be either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the comparison outcome, we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `target_len` for the loop to execute again. This means that `target_len` must be greater than the current value of `j`.

To summarize, we need to adjust the conditions for `len(s)` and `target_len` based on the current values of `i` and `j`. 

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters; `i` is less than `len(s) - 1`; `j` is less than `target_len`**
