The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified, and `j` remains unchanged. The states of `s` and `target` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is less than `len(s) - 1` and is now incremented by 1, `j` is less than `target_len` and remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is less than `len(s) - 1` and is now incremented by 1, `j` is less than `target_len` and remains unchanged**
