The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input and checks two conditions: If `c` is zero, it returns 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not zero, it returns 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. This includes edge cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` can take values from -10^9 to 10^9.
