The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change due to the print operation. Since `a` is equal to `b` and `c` is equal to 0, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `c` is 0, `a` is equal to `b`, and the output is 'YES'**
