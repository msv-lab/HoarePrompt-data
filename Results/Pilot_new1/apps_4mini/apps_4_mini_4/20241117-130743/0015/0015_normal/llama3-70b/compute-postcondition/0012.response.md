Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is zero (resulting in 'YES'), and also considers negative differences that are not divisible by `c` or positive differences that are not divisible by `c`, resulting in 'NO'.***
