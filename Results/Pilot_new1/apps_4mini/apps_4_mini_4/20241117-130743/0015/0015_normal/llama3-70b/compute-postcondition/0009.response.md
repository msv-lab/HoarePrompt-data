The code prints 'YES', and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that the program has successfully printed 'YES'. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` remain integers with their respective values, and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with their respective values, and the function prints 'YES'**
