To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the program and the problem requirements.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check if a favorite integer `b` appears in a sequence defined as:
- The first element is `a` (s_1 = a).
- The difference between any two neighboring elements is `c` (s_{i} - s_{i} - 1 = c).

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that s_{i} = b.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Check if b equals a:** If `b` is equal to `a`, it correctly prints 'YES'.
2. **Check if c is zero:** If `c` is zero and `b` is not equal to `a`, it correctly prints 'NO' because the sequence cannot change.
3. **Check divisibility and non-negativity:** For non-zero `c`, it checks if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Edge Cases:
- **When c = 0:** The program handles this correctly by returning 'NO' if `b` is not equal to `a`.
- **When a > b and c > 0:** The program should return 'NO' since the sequence will only increase.
- **When a < b and c < 0:** The program should return 'NO' since the sequence will only decrease.
- **When c < 0 and b = a:** The program should still return 'YES' since `b` is in the sequence.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the behavior of the program accurately:
- It correctly identifies when `b` is equal to `a`.
- It correctly identifies when `c` is zero.
- It checks the conditions for divisibility and non-negativity for the cases when `c` is non-zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic necessary to determine if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`. It handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly checks all cases as per the problem description and handles edge cases appropriately.
