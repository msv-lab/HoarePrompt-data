The code prints 'YES', which does not change the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still integers within the specified range, and since `b` is equal to `a`, this relationship remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and indicates that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned values from input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9; `b` is equal to `a`; 'YES' has been printed.**
