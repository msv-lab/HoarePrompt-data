Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative quotient, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed if either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative.***
