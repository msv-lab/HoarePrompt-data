The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a single line of input, splits it into separate values, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input values.**
