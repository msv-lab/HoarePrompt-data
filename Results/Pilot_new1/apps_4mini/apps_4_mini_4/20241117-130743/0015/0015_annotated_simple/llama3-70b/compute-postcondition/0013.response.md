Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed; if `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, 'YES' is printed if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This includes cases where `(b - a)` is zero (which is divisible by any non-zero `c`), as well as scenarios where `(b - a)` is negative or positive, affecting the output accordingly.***
