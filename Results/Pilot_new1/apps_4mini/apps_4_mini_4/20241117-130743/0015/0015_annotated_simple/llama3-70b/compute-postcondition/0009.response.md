The code prints 'YES', indicating a positive outcome based on the conditions provided in the initial state. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by the print statement, and their conditions confirm that `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and results in a non-negative integer. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the printed result.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, and 'YES' is printed.**
