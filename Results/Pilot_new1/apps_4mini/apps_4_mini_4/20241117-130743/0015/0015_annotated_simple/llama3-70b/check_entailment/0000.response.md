To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code step by step.

The problem requires checking if a number `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The common difference `c`

The sequence can be represented as:
- `s_1 = a`
- `s_2 = a + c`
- `s_3 = a + 2c`
- ...
- `s_i = a + (i-1)c`

The goal is to find if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. **Case when `c == 0`**:
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence does not change and remains constant at `a`. 
   - If `a == b`, it prints "YES" (since `b` is in the sequence). 
   - If `a != b`, it prints "NO" (since `b` cannot be in the sequence).
   
   This part is correct as it directly checks if `b` is equal to `a`.

3. **Case when `c != 0`**:
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to determine if `b` can be reached by some element in the sequence.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that `i` is a positive integer (since `b` must be greater than or equal to `a` when `c` is positive, or less than or equal to `a` when `c` is negative).
   
   This logic is also correct:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0`, it means `b` is reachable in the sequence.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that we are considering only valid terms in the sequence.

### Test Cases:
1. **Case 1**: `1 7 3` → "YES" (valid as `7` is part of the sequence)
2. **Case 2**: `10 10 0` → "YES" (valid as `10` is the constant value of the sequence)
3. **Case 3**: `1 -4 5` → "NO" (valid since all terms are greater than `-4`)
4. **Case 4**: `0 60 50` → "NO" (valid since all terms are multiples of `50` starting from `0`)

### Edge Cases:
- If `a = b` and `c = 0`, it returns "YES".
- If `a = b` and `c != 0`, it returns "YES".
- If `b < a` and `c > 0`, it returns "NO".
- If `b > a` and `c < 0`, it returns "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program successfully handles all edge cases and adheres to the problem requirements. There are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
