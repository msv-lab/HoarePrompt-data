The function accepts three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It prints 'YES' if `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`. If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.
