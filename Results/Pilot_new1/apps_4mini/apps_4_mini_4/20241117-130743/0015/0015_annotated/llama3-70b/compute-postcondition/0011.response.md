The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by this statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as they were assigned from input, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input; the printed output is 'NO'**
