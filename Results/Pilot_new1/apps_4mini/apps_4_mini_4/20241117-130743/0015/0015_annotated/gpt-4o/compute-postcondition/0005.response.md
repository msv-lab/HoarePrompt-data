The code outputs the string 'NO' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged in their values since the `print` statement does not modify them. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0**
