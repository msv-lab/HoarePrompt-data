The value of `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `b` is not specified, but it will now hold the new input integer. The values of `a` and `c` are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
