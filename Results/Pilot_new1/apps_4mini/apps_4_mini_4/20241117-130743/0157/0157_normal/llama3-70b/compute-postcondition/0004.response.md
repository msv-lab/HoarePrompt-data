To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided code snippet and initial state.

1. The initial state indicates that `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The code snippet performs the operation `print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)`.
3. This expression can be simplified as follows:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be factored out as `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.

Since the print statement outputs the calculated value, we will include that in the output state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4; the output is min_lemon * 7.**
