The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and the calculations for `b // 2` and `c // 4` will be based on their respective values. Therefore, the output state will reflect the minimum calculation based on the provided input values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
