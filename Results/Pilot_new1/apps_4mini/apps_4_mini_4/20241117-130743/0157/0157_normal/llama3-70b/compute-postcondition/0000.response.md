The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input value and convert it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` as an input integer, while `b` and `c` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
