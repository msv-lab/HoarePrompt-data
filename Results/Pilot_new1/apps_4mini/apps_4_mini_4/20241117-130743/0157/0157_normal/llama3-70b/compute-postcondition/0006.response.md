Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers from user input representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears. It calculates the minimum number of complete sets of items that can be created using the available fruits, where each set requires 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. It then prints the total value of the sets created, calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`. The function does not return a value but directly prints the result. **
