To determine the output state after running the provided code snippet, we first analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

1. `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This means it will take the smallest value among these three calculations.
2. The code snippet calculates `total_fruits` as follows:
   - `max_lemons * 1`: This gives the number of fruits from lemons.
   - `max_lemons * 2`: This gives the number of fruits from another source (e.g., oranges).
   - `max_lemons * 4`: This gives the number of fruits from yet another source (e.g., bananas).
3. Therefore, `total_fruits` is computed as:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`
   - This simplifies to `total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7`.

Given that `max_lemons` is determined based on the inputs, the final output state will include the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7**
