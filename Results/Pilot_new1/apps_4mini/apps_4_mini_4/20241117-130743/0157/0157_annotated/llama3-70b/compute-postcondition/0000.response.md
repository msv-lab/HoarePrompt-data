The variable `a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged, and their previous values are still valid as positive integers within the specified range. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` based on the user input, while `b` and `c` remain as they were.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
