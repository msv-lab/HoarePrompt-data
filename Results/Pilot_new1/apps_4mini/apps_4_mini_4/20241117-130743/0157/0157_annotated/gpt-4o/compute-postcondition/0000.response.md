The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` are not affected, and since `a` is a positive integer, it will now hold the value of the input integer. Therefore, the output state is `a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, and `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
