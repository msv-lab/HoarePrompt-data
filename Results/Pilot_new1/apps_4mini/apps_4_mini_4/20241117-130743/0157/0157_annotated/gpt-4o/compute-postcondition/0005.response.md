To determine the output state, we first analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
- `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`

The code snippet provided is:
```
print(total_fruits)
```

Now, we will calculate the value of `total_fruits` based on the initial state.

1. `max_lemons` is computed using the minimum of three values: 
   - `a` (input integer)
   - `b // 2` (half of input integer `b`)
   - `c // 4` (a quarter of input integer `c`)

2. `total_fruits` is then calculated as `max_lemons * 7`.

The `print` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`, but does not change any variables.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `max_lemons`, and `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is max_lemons * 7**
