The function accepts no parameters and reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the constraints of available ingredients, where `a` is the number of whole lemons, `b` is the number of fruits that can be used in pairs (each pair uses 2 fruits), and `c` is the number of fruits that can be used in groups of four (each group uses 4 fruits). The function then calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons and prints this total. It does not return any value.
