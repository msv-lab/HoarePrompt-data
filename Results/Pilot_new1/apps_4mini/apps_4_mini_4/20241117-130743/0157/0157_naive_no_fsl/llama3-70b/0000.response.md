To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic against the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: The program takes three integers: `a` (lemons), `b` (apples), and `c` (pears).
2. **Output**: The program should calculate the maximum total number of fruits (lemons + apples + pears) that can be used in the compote, adhering to the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears.

### Calculation Logic:
- The number of complete sets of fruits that can be used is determined by:
  - `lemons` are limited by `a`.
  - `apples` are limited by `b // 2` (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
  - `pears` are limited by `c // 4` (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).
  
Thus, the maximum number of complete sets of the fruits that can be used is:
```python
min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
```

The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as:
```python
min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
```
This simplifies to:
```python
min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7
```

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case with insufficient fruits**:
   - Input: `1`, `1`, `1` (1 lemon, 1 apple, 1 pear)
   - Expected Output: `0` (not enough of any fruit to make a complete set).
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4)` which results in `0`. The output is `0`, which is correct.

2. **Case with exact match**:
   - Input: `2`, `4`, `8` (2 lemons, 4 apples, 8 pears)
   - Expected Output: `14` (2 lemons, 4 apples, 8 pears).
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(2, 4 // 2, 8 // 4)` which results in `2`. The output is `14`, which is correct.

3. **Case with excess fruits**:
   - Input: `5`, `10`, `20` (5 lemons, 10 apples, 20 pears)
   - Expected Output: `70` (5 lemons, 10 apples, 20 pears).
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as `min(5, 10 // 2, 20 // 4)` which results in `5`. The output is `70`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used in the compote according to the problem description for all tested cases, including edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
