The variable `a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an input and convert it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is now an input integer, while `b` and `c` are still positive integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**
