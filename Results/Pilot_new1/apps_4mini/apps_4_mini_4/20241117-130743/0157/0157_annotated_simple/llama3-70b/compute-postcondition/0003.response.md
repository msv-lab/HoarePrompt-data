The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, so `b // 2` is the integer division of `b` by 2, and `c // 4` is the integer division of `c` by 4. The output state reflects the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, as well as the calculated value of `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
