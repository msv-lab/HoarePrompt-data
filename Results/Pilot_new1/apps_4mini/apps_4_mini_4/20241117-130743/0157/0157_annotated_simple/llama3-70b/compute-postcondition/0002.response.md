The value of `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
