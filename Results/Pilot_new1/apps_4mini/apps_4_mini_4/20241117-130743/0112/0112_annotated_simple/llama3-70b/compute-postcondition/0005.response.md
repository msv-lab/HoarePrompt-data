According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` contains more than 1 list, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 1 list, and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 2 lists, and `cube` should represent the second list in the `cubes` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of elements in `cube`.**
