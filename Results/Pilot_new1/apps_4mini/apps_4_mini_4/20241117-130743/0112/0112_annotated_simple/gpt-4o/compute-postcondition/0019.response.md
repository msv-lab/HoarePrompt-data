Postcondition: ***`n` is 3, `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If either `used_cubes[2]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` remains unchanged and `found` may or may not be set to True depending on prior conditions.***
