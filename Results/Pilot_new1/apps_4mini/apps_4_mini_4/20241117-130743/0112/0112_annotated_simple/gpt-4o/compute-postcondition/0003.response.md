The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `used_cubes`, or `digits`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, and `found` is False.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, and `found` is False**
