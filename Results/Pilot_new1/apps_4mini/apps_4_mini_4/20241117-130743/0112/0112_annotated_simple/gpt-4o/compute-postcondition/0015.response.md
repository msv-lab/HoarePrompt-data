According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. 

Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. If `n` is at its maximum of 3, the current value of `i` would be 2 at the end of the last iteration, which means the loop can execute again if `n` is at least 3. 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `n` must be 3 to allow the loop to execute one more time.
- `i` should be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
  
State: **`n` is 3, `i` is 2**
