The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`, but it already has that value in the initial state. Therefore, the state of the other variables remains unchanged. The output state reflects that `found` remains `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean elements indicating whether each cube has been used, `found` is False, and there is at least one more digit in `digits`**
