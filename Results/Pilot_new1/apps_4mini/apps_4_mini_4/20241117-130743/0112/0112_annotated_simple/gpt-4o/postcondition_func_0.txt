The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists (each containing 6 integers between 0 and 9). It checks sequentially if the `can_form_number` function returns true for the integers starting from 1. The function returns the first integer `x` for which `can_form_number(x)` is true, or 0 if none of the integers from 1 onward satisfy this condition. The actual upper limit of `x` is not defined in the code, meaning it could theoretically continue indefinitely if `can_form_number` never returns true for any positive integer.
