Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean elements indicating whether each cube has been used, `found` is False, and at least one of the cubes has not matched the `digit` or all cubes have been checked without finding a match. The state of `used_cubes` remains unchanged for the cubes that were not found to match the `digit`.***
