The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`. The other variables (`n`, `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `found` while keeping the other variables as they were.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` has the second element set to True, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
