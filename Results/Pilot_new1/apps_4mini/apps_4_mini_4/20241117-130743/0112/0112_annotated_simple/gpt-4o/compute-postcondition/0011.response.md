The code assigns the value `True` to the `i`-th index of the list `used_cubes`. Given that `i` is 1, the second element of `used_cubes` (index 1) is set to `True`. The values of `n`, `digits`, `found`, and the other elements of `used_cubes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `used_cubes`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` has the second element set to True, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is False, `i` is 1**
