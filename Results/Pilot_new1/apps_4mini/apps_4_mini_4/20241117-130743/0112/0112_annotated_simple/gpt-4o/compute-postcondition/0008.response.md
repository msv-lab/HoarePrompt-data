The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list where the first element is True and the rest are False, `digits` is a list with at least 1 element, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
