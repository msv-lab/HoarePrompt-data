According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one character. Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is between 1 and 3, which indicates that `cube_faces` is likely populated with corresponding lists, but this does not directly affect the execution of the loop. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to establish that `digits` is not empty. Additionally, since we are iterating over `digits`, we should also initialize `digit` to the first character in the `digits` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`**
