Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, and `digit` is the second character in `digits`. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[2]` is True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[2]`, then no changes occur to `used_cubes[2]` or `found`.***
