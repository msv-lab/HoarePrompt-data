The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is now True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
