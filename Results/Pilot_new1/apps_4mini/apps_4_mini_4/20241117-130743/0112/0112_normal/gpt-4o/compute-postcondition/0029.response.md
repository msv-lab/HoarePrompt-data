According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. The loop will iterate over each digit in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` has at least 2 digits, and `digit` is the second digit in the list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `digit` must be updated to the next digit in the list, which would be the third digit. The `digits` list must still contain at least 3 digits for the loop to continue executing. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `digit` is now the third digit in the list, and `digits` must have at least 3 digits.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a list with at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list**
