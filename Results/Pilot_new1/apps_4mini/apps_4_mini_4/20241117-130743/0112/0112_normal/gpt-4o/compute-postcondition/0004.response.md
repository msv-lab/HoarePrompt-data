According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined to be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. The other variables (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `digit`, and `found`) do not affect the execution of the loop itself, but they are relevant to the state of the program.

Thus, for the loop to execute, the values of `n`, `i`, and `found` should be noted. Since `i` starts from 0, we can state that `i` is 0 at the beginning of the loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
