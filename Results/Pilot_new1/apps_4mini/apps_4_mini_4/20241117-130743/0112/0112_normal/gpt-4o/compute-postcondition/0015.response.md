According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2. This means the loop can execute again.

For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. Since `n` is at least 2, `i` (which will be 2) will still be less than `n`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `digit`. 

The variable `digit` should be updated to reflect the character that corresponds to `i` in the `digits` list. Since `i` will be 2, `digit` should be the second character in `digits`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` is now 2.
- `digit` is the second character in `digits`.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, and `i` is 2.**
