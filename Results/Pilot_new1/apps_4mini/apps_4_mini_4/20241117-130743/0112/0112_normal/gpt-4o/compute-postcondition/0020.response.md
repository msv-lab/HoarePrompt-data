According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, but we do not know the exact value of `i`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. If `i` was at its maximum value (which is `n-1`), then it would need to be adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to run again.

Thus, we can conclude that if `i` is currently `n-1`, we must adjust it to `n`, which would mean the loop cannot execute again. Therefore, we need to assume `i` must be at least 1 (which is a valid assumption given `n` is at least 2) to allow for another iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `i` is less than `n`**
