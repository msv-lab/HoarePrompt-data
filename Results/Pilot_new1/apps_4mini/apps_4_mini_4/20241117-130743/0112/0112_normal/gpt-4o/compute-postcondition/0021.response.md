Output State: **`found` is True if `digit` is found in any of the `cube_faces` lists corresponding to unused cubes, and the respective `used_cubes` entry is set to True. If `digit` is not found in any of the `cube_faces` lists or all cubes are already used, then `found` remains False and `used_cubes` remains unchanged. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `found` is False.**
