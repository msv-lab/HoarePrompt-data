The value of `found` is assigned as `False`, which is the same as its previous value; therefore, there is no change in the state of the variable. The other variables are not affected. The output state reflects that `found` remains `False`, and the status of `digits` and `digit` is unchanged.

Output State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a list with at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second digit in the list**
