The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `num` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `num` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `num` ≤ 3, and `cube_faces` is a list containing `num` lists. Each inner list consists of 6 integers, where each integer is in the range 0 to 9, representing the digits on the faces of the cubes.

After executing the function body, the function has two cases for returning values:
- Case 1: If all digits in `digits` are found in `cube_faces`, the function will return `True`. If any digit cannot be matched with an unused cube, the function will return `False`. If `num` is less than 1 or if `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains unchanged (all False).
  
- Case 2: The program returns `True` if the required conditions are met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, and return `True` if the digits can be formed using the cubes represented in `cube_faces`, or `False` if they cannot be formed or if no digits are provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces`, returning `True` if the digits can be formed using the cubes, or `False` if they cannot be formed or if no digits are provided.**
