The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the `i`-th cube face has now been used. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists of integers, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in `digits`, `found` is False, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[i]` is now True.
