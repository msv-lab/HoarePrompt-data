According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 3 lists, and since `cube` is the second list currently, it will need to be updated to the third list in the next iteration. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists; `cube` is the third list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
