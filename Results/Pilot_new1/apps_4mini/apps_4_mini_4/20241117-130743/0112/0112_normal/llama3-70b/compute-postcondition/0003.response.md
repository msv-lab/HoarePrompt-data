According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, the `cubes` list must contain at least one list (i.e., `cubes` must not be empty). The variable `cube` will represent the current list in the `cubes` during each iteration of the loop.

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it is likely that `cubes` could be populated based on `n`. However, since we are not given the specific contents of `cubes`, we must state that `cubes` should contain at least 1 list for the loop to execute.

Therefore, before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `cubes` is not empty. The variable `cube` should be initialized to the first element of `cubes` during the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
