Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from all lists in `cubes`. If '0' was in `digits`, it has been removed; otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` is an empty set. If `n` is 1, `cubes` contains at least 1 list; if `n` is 2, `cubes` contains at least 2 lists; and if `n` is 3, `cubes` contains at least 3 lists.***
