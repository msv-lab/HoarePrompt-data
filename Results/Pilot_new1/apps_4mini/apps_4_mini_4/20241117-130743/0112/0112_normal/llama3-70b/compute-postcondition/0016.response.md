The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer constrained to the values 1, 2, or 3. Additionally, the function processes cubes represented as lists of 6 integers, where each integer `a_{i}_{j}` satisfies the constraint 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information, but it implies that it operates on the cubes based on the value of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of 6 integers representing a cube, with each integer in the range of 0 to 9. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and processes cubes represented as lists of 6 integers (each between 0 and 9).**
