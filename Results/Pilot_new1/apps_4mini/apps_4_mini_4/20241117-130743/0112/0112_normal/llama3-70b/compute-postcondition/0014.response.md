Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from all lists in `cubes`, and `max_num` is assigned the maximum integer formed by sorting `digits` in descending order and joining them as a string. If `digits` is empty, `max_num` would be 0; otherwise, `max_num` is the largest integer that can be formed from `digits`.**
