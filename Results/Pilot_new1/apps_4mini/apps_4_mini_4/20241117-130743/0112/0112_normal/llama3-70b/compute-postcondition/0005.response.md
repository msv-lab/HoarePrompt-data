According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each `cube` in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 list, so in order for the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least 2 lists in `cubes`. Since `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, after the last iteration, `cube` must be updated to the second list in `cubes` for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are: 
- `n` should be updated to reflect that there are at least 2 lists in `cubes`.
- `cube` should be updated to the second list in `cubes`.
- `digits` should be updated to reflect the string representations of the integers in the new `cube`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
