The code `digits.remove('0')` attempts to remove the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since the initial state specifies that the set `digits` includes the string '0', this operation will successfully remove '0' from the set. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` would be an empty set, but since it contains '0', we can conclude that `cubes` is not empty and `digits` had at least one element before the removal. 

After executing the code, `digits` will no longer contain '0'. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0'**
