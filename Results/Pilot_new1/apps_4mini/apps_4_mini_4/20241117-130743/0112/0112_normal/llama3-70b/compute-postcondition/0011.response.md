Postcondition: ***`digits` is a set containing the string representations of all integers from all lists in `cubes`, and the set `digits` includes the string '0'. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. If `n` is 1, then `cubes` contains at least 1 list; if `n` is 2, then `cubes` contains at least 2 lists; if `n` is 3, then `cubes` contains at least 3 lists.***
