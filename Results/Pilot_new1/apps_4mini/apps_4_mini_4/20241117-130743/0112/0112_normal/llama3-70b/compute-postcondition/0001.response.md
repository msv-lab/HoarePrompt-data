The variable `cubes` is assigned a list of lists, where each inner list is created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The number of inner lists created is determined by the value of `n`, which can be 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, `cubes` will hold either 1, 2, or 3 lists based on the input provided. The values of `n` remain unchanged, and other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists based on input**
