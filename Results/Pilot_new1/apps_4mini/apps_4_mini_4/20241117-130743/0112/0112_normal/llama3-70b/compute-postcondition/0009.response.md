According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute once for each list in `cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 4 lists; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated with string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
