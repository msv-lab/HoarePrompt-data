To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state.

1. The variable `digits` is a set containing string representations of integers. If '0' was present, it has been removed, and if `cubes` is empty, `digits` is also empty.
2. The code `max_num = int(''.join(sorted(digits, reverse=True)))` intends to create the largest integer possible by sorting the string representations of the numbers in `digits` in descending order and then joining them together.
3. The `sorted` function will sort the elements of `digits` in reverse order, and `join` will concatenate them into a single string.
4. Finally, `int` converts this string back into an integer to assign it to `max_num`.

The output state will depend on the contents of `digits`. If `digits` is empty, then `max_num` will not be assigned a valid integer. If `digits` contains values, we will have a valid integer derived from the sorted values.

Since we don't have specific values for `digits`, we can conclude the output state based on the possible scenarios:

- If `digits` is empty, `max_num` cannot be computed, and we note that it remains undefined.
- If `digits` contains values, `max_num` will be the largest integer formed by those string representations.

However, without specific values for `digits`, we will assume the general case where `max_num` is defined based on the contents of `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers; `max_num` is the largest integer formed from `digits` or remains undefined if `digits` is empty.**
