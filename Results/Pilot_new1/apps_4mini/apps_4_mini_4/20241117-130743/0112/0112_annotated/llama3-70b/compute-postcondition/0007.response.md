According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 lists, and `cube` should be the third list in `cubes`. 

Therefore, the adjusted states will be:
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 3 (since it can be either 3 in this case).
- `cube` should be updated to be the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to contain string representations of integers in `cube`.**
