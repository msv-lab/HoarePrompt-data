The statement `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' is an element of `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The other variables, `n` and `cubes`, remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that '0' has been removed from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` does not contain '0' anymore, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with a length between 0 and 3.**
