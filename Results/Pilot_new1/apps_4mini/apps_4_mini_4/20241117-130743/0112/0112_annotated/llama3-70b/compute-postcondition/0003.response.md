According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute, `cubes` must contain at least one list of integers. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it suggests that `cubes` could potentially have 1 to 3 lists based on user input. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` remains an empty set. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `cubes` has at least one list. Therefore, the state should reflect that `cubes` contains at least one list and `cube` is the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, `digits` is an empty set**
