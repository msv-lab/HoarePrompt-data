The code initializes a list `cubes` by taking `n` inputs, where each input consists of space-separated integers that are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `n` can be either 1, 2, or 3, which determines how many times the input will be taken. The previous state of `n` is not affected, but the new variable `cubes` will hold a list of lists based on the input provided.

Since the input is dynamic and depends on user input, we cannot specify the exact contents of `cubes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the possible values of `n` and the fact that `cubes` will be a list of lists of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on user input**
