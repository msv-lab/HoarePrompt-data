The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched with the faces of a given number of cubes (`cube_faces`). If all digits can be matched with the available cube faces, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, which could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, if `num` contains no digits (e.g., if it is 0), the function will return True since the loop will not execute.
