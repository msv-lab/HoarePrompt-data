You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Absent-minded Masha got set of n cubes for her birthday.

At each of 6 faces of each cube, there is exactly one digit from 0 to 9. Masha became interested what is the largest natural x such she can make using her new cubes all integers from 1 to x.

To make a number Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row. After that, she looks at upper faces of cubes from left to right and reads the number.

The number can't contain leading zeros. It's not required to use all cubes to build a number.

Pay attention: Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations.


-----Input-----

In first line integer n is given (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) — the number of cubes, Masha got for her birthday.

Each of next n lines contains 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) — number on j-th face of i-th cube.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — maximum number x such Masha can make any integers from 1 to x using her cubes or 0 if Masha can't make even 1.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

Output
87
Input
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

Output
98


-----Note-----

In the first test case, Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87, but she can't make 88 because there are no two cubes with digit 8.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, cubes):
    cube_faces = [set(cube) for cube in cubes]
    x = 0
    while can_form_number(x + 1):
        x += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `if can_form_number(1) is true then x` is 1, `if can_form_number(2) is true then x` is 2, `if can_form_number(3) is true then x` is 3, `if can_form_number(4) is false then x` is 4. If can_form_number(1) is false initially, the loop does not execute and x remains 0. If can_form_number(2) is false after the first iteration, x is 1 and the loop does not execute again. If can_form_number(3) is false after the second iteration, x is 2 and the loop does not execute again.
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which depends on the results of can_form_number(1), can_form_number(2), and can_form_number(3). If all are false, it returns 0; if can_form_number(1) is true, it returns 1; if can_form_number(1) is true and can_form_number(2) is false, it returns 1; if can_form_number(1) and can_form_number(2) are true but can_form_number(3) is false, it returns 2; if all are true, it returns 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists (cubes), each containing 6 integers (0 to 9). It returns an integer `x` which represents the maximum number of consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the cubes. If none of the numbers can be formed, it returns 0; if only 1 can be formed, it returns 1; if 1 and 2 can be formed but not 3, it returns 2; and if 1, 2, and 3 can all be formed, it returns 3. The function does not explicitly check for cases where `n` is outside the range of 1 to 3 or where the cubes do not contain valid integers between 0 and 9.

#Function 2:
def can_form_number(num):
    digits = list(str(num))
    used_cubes = [False] * n
    for digit in digits:
        found = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]:
                used_cubes[i] = True
                found = True
                break
        
        if not found:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `digits` contains all digits that can be found in `cube_faces`, then `used_cubes` will have at least one True value for each digit found, corresponding to the `cube_faces` list that contains it. If any digit in `digits` cannot be matched with any available cube face, the function returns False immediately. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False. If `n` is greater than 3, this is an invalid state, and should be handled accordingly, but it does not affect the execution of the loop in this fragment. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `used_cubes` remains all False.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched with the faces of a given number of cubes (`cube_faces`). If all digits can be matched with the available cube faces, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, which could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, if `num` contains no digits (e.g., if it is 0), the function will return True since the loop will not execute.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
