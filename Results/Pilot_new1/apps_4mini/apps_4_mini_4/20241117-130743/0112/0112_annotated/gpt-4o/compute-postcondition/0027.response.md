According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` variable. If `digits` has at least one more digit, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `digits` has at least one more digit. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `digits` must have at least one more digit than it did at the end of the last iteration.

Since the loop iterates over each `digit` in `digits`, we need to ensure that the next state reflects that there is one additional digit available for the loop to process. 

State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and `digits` has at least two more digits**
