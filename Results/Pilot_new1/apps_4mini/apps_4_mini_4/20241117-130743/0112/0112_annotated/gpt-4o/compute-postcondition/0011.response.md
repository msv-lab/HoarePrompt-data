The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, changing the boolean value at index `i` in the list `used_cubes` from `False` to `True`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with `used_cubes[i]` set to True, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, `found` is a boolean variable, and `i` is 1**
