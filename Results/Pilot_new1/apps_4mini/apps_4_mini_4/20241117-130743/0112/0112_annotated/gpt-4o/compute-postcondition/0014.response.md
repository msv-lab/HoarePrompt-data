Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, initially all set to False. If `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` (the first element of `digits`) is found in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `digit` is not in `cube_faces[1]` or `used_cubes[1]` is already True, then `used_cubes[1]` remains False, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues without any modifications to these variables.***
