According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, this means that the loop will execute at least once because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will be initialized to 0 for the first iteration. The current state of `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, and `found` is set to False, which does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range, and we need to indicate the initial value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to False, `digit` is the first element in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
