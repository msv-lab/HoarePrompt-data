The code converts the integer `num` into a string and then creates a list of its characters (digits). However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `num`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `num` can be any integer value, and `digits` will be a list of string representations of those digits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, each containing exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9); `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits of `num`.**
