Postcondition: ***If `found` is False, the function returns False. If `found` is True, the state of `used_cubes` remains unchanged, and it will have at least one True value corresponding to the presence of `digit` in the `cube_faces` lists checked. If `n` is less than 1, `used_cubes` remains all False and `found` remains False. If `n` is greater than 3, it is an invalid state and should be handled accordingly, but this state does not affect the execution of the return statement in this fragment.***
