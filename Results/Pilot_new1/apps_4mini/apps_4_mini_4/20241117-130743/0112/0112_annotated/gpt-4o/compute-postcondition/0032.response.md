The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cube_faces`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains exactly 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes. 

The functionality of the function is as follows: 
- If `digits` contains all digits that can be found in `cube_faces`, then the function checks if each digit can be matched with an available cube face. If any digit in `digits` cannot be matched, the function returns False immediately. 
- If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, or if `digits` is empty, the function will not execute the main logic and will return False as `used_cubes` remains all False.
- If all digits can be matched with the cube faces, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `n` and a list of lists `cube_faces`, and to determine if the digits can be formed using the faces of the cubes, returning True if possible and False otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `n` lists `cube_faces`, each containing 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It returns True if all digits can be matched with the cube faces; otherwise, it returns False.**
