Output State: **If `current_counts` meets the minimum requirements defined by `desired_counts` at any point during the loop execution, the loop will continue to adjust `left` and `current_counts` until either the counts match exactly (returning 'YES') or the loop completes without an exact match. If `current_counts` does not meet the requirements initially, the loop does not execute, and `current_counts` remains unchanged with its initial values. After executing the loop, `right` will be equal to the number of iterations completed (from 0 to n-1), and `left` will reflect how many colors have been processed. If the loop completes without returning 'YES', it indicates that while `current_counts` met the minimum requirements, it did not match the desired counts exactly. Additionally, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100, or if `m` is less than 1 or greater than `n`, these cases would lead to an invalid state where the loop would not execute.**
