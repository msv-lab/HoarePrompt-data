Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where the sum of the elements in `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict of int initialized to 0 for any missing keys, `left` is 0, `right` is `right` value, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1.**
