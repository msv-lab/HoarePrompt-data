Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged. If `found` is True, the loop breaks, indicating that `window_counts` contains the processed counts of colors from the specified range, and `i` is the starting index of that range. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute, meaning `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, and the state of `found` is unchanged.***
