Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the `colors` list and values are the counts of occurrences of those integers. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If `colors` contains at least one element, the loop executes for each element in `colors` and counts how many times each color appears.**
