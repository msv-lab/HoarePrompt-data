Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
