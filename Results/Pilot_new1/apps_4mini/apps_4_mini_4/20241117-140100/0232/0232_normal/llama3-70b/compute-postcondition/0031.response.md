Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if the counts of the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values after `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts do not match, `found` remains False, and the loop continues without breaking. Additionally, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `j` is 0, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[0]`.***
