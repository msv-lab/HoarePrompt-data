The code assigns a new value to `counts`, which is created by mapping the `input` string (a space-separated list of integers) to integers. The previous state of `counts` is unknown, but it will now hold a new list of integers based on the user input. The previous values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. Since `counts` is being redefined, the output state reflects the new value of `counts` based on the input provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input, `counts` is a list of integers from input**
