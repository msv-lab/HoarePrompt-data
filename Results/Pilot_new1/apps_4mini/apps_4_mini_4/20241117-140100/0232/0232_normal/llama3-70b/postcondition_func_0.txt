The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lists: `colors` and `counts`. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray within `colors` that contains the exact counts of each unique color as specified in `counts`. If such a subarray is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0, as it would lead to no checks being performed, and it does not validate the inputs for correctness.
