Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. If the conditions are not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues execution. The variable `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `j` is 2, with `window_counts[color]` having been incremented by 1 prior to the evaluation.***
