The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is at least 1 and less than `n`, and `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]`.
