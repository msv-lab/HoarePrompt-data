Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` after incrementing `window_counts[color]` by 1. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the program continues without breaking out of the loop. Additionally, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]`.***
