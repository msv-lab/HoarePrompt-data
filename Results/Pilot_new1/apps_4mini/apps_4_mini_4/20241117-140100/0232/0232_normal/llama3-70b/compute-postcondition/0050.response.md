Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, indicating that the counts of the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values after incrementing `window_counts[color]`. Additionally, `i` and `j` may have any values depending on the loop execution, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` contains the updated count for `color`.***
