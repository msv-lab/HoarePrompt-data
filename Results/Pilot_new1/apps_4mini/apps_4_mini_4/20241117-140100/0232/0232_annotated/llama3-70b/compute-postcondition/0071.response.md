The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts[color]` is updated by incrementing its value by 1, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
