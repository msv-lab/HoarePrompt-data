Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts reflecting the counts of each color encountered in `colors` from index `i` to `n-1`. If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `i` unchanged. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` remaining empty, `found` being False, and `i` unchanged.***
