Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `color`, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` remains greater than `i + 1`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, the program continues without changing the value of `found`.***
