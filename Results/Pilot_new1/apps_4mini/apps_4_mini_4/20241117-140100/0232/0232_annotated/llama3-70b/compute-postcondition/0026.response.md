Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `window_counts` will contain the key `color` with a value of 0 if it was not already present; if `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged. The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
