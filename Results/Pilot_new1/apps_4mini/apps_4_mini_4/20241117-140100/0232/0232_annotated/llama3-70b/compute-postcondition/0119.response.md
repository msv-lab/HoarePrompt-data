According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to run one more time. 

Since the loop executes at least once if `n` is greater than `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed greater than the next value of `i`, which would be `i + 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than `i + 1`.

If we denote the current value of `i` as `i` (which is the value before the next iteration), we need to set `n` to be greater than `i + 1`. 

No other states need to be adjusted since `window_counts` and `found` are not dependent on the loop's ability to execute again; they are only relevant during the loop execution.

State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary containing counts of colors from `colors`, `found` is True, `n` is greater than `i + 1`**
