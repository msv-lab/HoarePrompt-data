Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is updated with `color` as a key, incrementing its value by 1; `found` remains False, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted.***
