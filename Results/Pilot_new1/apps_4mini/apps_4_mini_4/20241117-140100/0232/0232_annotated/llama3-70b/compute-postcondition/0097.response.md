Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not contain the key `color`. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating that all counts equal their respective targets, then `found` is set to True, and we break out of the loop. In this case, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains greater than `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, it has been added with a value of `1`, otherwise, its value has been incremented by `1`. If the condition is not met, no changes occur to `found`, and the execution continues without breaking the loop.***
