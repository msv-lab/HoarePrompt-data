Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the counts of colors from `colors` starting from index `i` to `n - 1`. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the loop executes 0 times (when `n` is not greater than `i + 1`), `window_counts` remains empty, and `found` remains True. If `n` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop will execute at least once, updating `window_counts` with at least one color from `colors`, and the value of `found` will depend on whether the counts match the targets in `counts`.**
