Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is updated such that if `color` is not already a key, it is added with a value of 0. The variable `found` remains True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
