The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[j-1]`, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` ranges from `i` to `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop.
