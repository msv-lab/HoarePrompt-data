The `counts` variable is assigned a new list created by mapping the input values (which are split into separate strings) to integers. The previous state of `counts` is not known, but it will be replaced by this new list. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `colors` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `counts` now holds a list of integers based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive, `colors` is a list of new integers based on input, and `counts` is now a list of integers based on input.**
