Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing counts of colors from `colors`. The variable `found` is True, indicating that either the loop executed and the sorted values of `window_counts` matched the corresponding values in `counts`, or the loop did not execute (when `n` is not greater than `i + 1`), resulting in `window_counts` being empty.***
