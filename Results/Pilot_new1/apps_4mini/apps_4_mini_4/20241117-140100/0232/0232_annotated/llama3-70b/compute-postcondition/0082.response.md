Output State: **`window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[j-1]`, `found` is True if the counts match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted; otherwise, it remains False. `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`, and `j` ranges from `i` to `n-1`. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` empty and `found` as False.**
