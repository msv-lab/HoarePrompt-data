Postcondition: ***`window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `found` is True, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it is now initialized to 0. If the counts in `window_counts` match the target counts (as determined by the condition in the if statement), then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited.***
