The line of code `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts` by 1. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it will be added with a value of 1. If it is already a key, its value will be increased by 1. The variables `j` and `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of `window_counts` based on whether `color` was already a key or not.

Output State: **`window_counts` is updated with `color` incremented by 1; `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `i + 1**.
