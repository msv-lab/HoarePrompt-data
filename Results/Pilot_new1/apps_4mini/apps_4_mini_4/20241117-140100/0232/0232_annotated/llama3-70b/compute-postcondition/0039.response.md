Postcondition: ***`color` is the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `found` is set to True if the counts of colors in `window_counts` match the target counts specified in `counts`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the loop continues. The values of `window_counts[color]` have been incremented by 1, and `i` is still 1, with `n` greater than 0.***
