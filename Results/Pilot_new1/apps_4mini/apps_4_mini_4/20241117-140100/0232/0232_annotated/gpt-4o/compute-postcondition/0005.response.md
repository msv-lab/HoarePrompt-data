Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers where the sum of the elements in k is less than or equal to n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to the corresponding elements in k, `current_counts` is updated for `colors[right]`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and for every color in `desired_counts`, the count in `current_counts` matches the count in `desired_counts`.***
