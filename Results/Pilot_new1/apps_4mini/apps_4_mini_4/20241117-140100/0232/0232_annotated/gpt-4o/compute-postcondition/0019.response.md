The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The variable `right` is equal to `n`, and `current_counts` is adjusted to reflect the count of `colors[n]`. Therefore, the value at the index `colors[n]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`current_counts` is adjusted to reflect the count of `colors[n]` incremented by 1; `right` is equal to n**
