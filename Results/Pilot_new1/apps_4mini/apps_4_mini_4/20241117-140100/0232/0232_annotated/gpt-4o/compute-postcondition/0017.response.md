The variable `current_counts` is updated to reflect the new count of the color associated with the index `right`. The color at `right` is accessed using `colors[right]`, and its count in `current_counts` is incremented by 1. The previous state of `current_counts` is adjusted to reflect the decremented counts of other colors processed, and `right` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated count for the specific color and the incremented value of `right`.

Output State: **`current_counts` is adjusted to reflect the incremented count of `colors[right]`, `right` is incremented by 1**
