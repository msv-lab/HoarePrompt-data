According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `right` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `right` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1`. Since `current_counts` is updated at the index `colors[right]`, it is also necessary to ensure that `colors` has an appropriate length to accommodate `right + 1`. 

State: **`current_counts` is updated at the index `colors[n]`, left remains equal to its initial value, right is equal to n + 1**
