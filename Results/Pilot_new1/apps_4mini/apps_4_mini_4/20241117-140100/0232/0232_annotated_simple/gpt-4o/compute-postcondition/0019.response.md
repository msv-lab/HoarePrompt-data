The value at `current_counts` at the index corresponding to `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. The variable `left` remains unchanged from its initial value, and `right` is now equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `current_counts` is updated at the index `colors[right]`, `left` remains equal to its initial value, and `right` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated at the index `colors[right]`, `left` remains equal to its initial value, and `right` is equal to `n**
