Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` sorted are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is met, the loop is exited, and `i` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, where `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the state of `window_counts` and other variables is unaffected by this block.***
