Postcondition: ***`window_counts` includes the key `color`, which is set to 0 if it was not previously present. The values of `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, while `j` is `i + 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
