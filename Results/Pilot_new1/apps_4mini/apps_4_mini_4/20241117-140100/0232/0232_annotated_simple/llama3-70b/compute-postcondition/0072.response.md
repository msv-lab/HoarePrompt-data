Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the key `color` with its value updated based on its previous state, and `color_counts` remains unchanged. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged.***
