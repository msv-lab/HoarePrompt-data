Output State: **`found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` (sorted) are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, indicating a successful match. If the loop does not execute (when `n` is less than or equal to `i`), `found` remains False, `window_counts` remains empty, `color_counts` remains unchanged, and `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is equal to 0 or less, the loop does not execute, `found` remains False, `window_counts` remains empty, and `color_counts` remains unchanged.**
