The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary. The initial state indicates that `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. Since `window_counts` is being initialized to an empty dictionary, the other variables are unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
