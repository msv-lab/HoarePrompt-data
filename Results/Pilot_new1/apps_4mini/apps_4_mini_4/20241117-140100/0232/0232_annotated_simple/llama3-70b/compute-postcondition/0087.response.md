The code initializes `window_counts` as an empty dictionary. The previous values of `window_counts` are ignored since it is being completely reassigned. The variables `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `window_counts` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`**
