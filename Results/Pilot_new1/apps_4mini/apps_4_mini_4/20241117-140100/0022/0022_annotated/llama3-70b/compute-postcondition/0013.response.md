The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the initial values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain the same. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `is_spalindrome` is set to False**
