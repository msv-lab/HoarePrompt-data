The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string of English letters with a length of at least 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is 2; `is_spalindrome` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
