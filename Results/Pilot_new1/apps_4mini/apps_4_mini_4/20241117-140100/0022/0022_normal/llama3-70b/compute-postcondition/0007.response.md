Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string of English letters with a length of at least 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; if the character at index `i` (which is 0) does not equal the character at index `n - i - 1` (the last character of `s`), then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome, and we break out of the loop. If the characters are equal, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating the string may still be a palindrome, pending further checks.***
