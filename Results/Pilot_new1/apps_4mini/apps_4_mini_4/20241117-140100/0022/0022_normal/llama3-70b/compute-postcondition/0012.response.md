According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` would be at least 1, which means the loop can still run. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted to 2 for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is an input string of English letters with a length of at least 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is 2; `is_spalindrome` remains True**
