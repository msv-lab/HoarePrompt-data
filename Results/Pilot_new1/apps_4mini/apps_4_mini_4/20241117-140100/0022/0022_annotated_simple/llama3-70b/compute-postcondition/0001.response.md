The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function, which counts the number of characters in `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of only English letters and has a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` will be assigned the value of the length of `s`. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, and `n` is the length of that string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of that string**
