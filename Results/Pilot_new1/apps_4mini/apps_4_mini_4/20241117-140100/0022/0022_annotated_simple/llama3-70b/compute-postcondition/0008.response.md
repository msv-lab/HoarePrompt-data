According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, so it will become 1. Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, the loop can execute again with `i` being 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `s` remains a string of at least 2 characters, and `is_spalindrome` is still True as the characters at the specified indices have not been checked yet.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1**
