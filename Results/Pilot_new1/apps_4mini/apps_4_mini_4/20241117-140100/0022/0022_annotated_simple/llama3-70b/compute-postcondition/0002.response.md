The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the state of `s` and `n` remains the same. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of that string, and `is_spalindrome` is True.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of that string, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
