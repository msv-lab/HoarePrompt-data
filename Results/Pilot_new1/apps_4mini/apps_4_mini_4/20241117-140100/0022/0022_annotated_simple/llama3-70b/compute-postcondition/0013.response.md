The variable `is_palindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not change the values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the new assignment.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of at least 2 English letters, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `is_palindrome` is False**
