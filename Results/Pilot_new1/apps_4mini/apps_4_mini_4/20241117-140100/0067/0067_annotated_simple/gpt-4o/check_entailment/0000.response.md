To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic and the output based on different inputs.

The program reads three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes as follows:
- `min_upvotes = x`
- `max_upvotes = x + z`
- `min_downvotes = y`
- `max_downvotes = y + z`

The program then checks:
1. If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it prints `'-'`.
2. If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) is less than the minimum possible upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it prints `'+'`.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

Let's evaluate the provided examples:

1. **Input:** `3 7 0`  
   - `min_upvotes = 3`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7`, `max_downvotes = 7`  
   - `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` (3 < 7) → Output: `'-'` (Correct)

2. **Input:** `2 0 1`  
   - `min_upvotes = 2`, `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`  
   - `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` (1 < 2) → Output: `'+'` (Correct)

3. **Input:** `1 1 0`  
   - `min_upvotes = 1`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1`, `max_downvotes = 1`  
   - Neither condition is satisfied → Output: `'0'` (Incorrect, should be `'0'` but the program prints `'?'`)

4. **Input:** `0 0 1`  
   - `min_upvotes = 0`, `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0`, `max_downvotes = 1`  
   - Neither condition is satisfied → Output: `'?'` (Correct, since there are two possible outcomes: either 0 upvotes or 1 upvote)

Now, let's analyze a specific case that the program does not handle correctly:

**Case:** `1 1 0`  
- The expected output should be `'0'` since there are equal upvotes and downvotes. However, the program would print `'?'`, leading to an incorrect result.

Given this analysis, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
