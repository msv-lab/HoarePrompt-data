Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, a hyphen '-' is printed. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, a plus '+' is printed. Otherwise, a question mark '?' is printed, indicating uncertainty about the outcome. This captures all cases, including when the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, when maximum downvotes are less than minimum upvotes, and when neither condition is met.***
