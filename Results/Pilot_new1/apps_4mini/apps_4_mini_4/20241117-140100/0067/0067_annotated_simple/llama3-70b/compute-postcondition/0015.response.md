Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, '0' is printed; otherwise, '?' is printed. If `x` is greater than `y`, '?' is printed. In all cases, it holds that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.***
