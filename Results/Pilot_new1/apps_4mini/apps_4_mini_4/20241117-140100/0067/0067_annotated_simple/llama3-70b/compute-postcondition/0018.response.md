The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three internal integer variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained to be between 0 and 100 inclusive. However, since no specific output or behavior has been provided in the output section, we cannot determine what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined based on the provided information.
