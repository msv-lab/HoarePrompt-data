The code executes a print statement which outputs the string `?`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. The string `?` is printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, `x` is greater than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`; the string `?` is printed.**
