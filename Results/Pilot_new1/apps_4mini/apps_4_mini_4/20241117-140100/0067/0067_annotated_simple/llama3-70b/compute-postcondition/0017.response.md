Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, the output is '-'; if `x` is equal to `y`, '0' is printed when `z` is 0, otherwise '?' is printed; if `x` is greater than `y`, '?' is printed. In all cases, it holds that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.***
