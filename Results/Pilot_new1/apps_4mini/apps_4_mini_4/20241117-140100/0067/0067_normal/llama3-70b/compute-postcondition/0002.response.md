The code executes a `print` statement, which outputs the string `'+'`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print statement has been executed, and the variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, and the output is '+'**
