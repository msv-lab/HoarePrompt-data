The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. The value of `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, and both `x` and `z` are integers based on the input values. Therefore, after execution, `max_upvotes` will be the sum of `x` and `z`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input values; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`**
