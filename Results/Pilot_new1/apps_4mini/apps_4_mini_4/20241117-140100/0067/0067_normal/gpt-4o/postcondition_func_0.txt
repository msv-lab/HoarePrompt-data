The function does not accept any parameters and reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. It prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' if neither condition is met, indicating that the upvotes and downvotes overlap or are equal. The function does not return any value.
