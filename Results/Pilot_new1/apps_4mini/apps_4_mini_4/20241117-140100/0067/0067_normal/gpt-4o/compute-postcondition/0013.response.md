Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (`y`), the output is '-'. If `max_downvotes` (`y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (`x`), the output is '+'. Otherwise, the output is '?', covering all cases where `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` interact, including situations where they are equal.***
