Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. If the maximum downvotes `y + z` is less than the minimum upvotes `x`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. This ensures that the condition `x + z >= y` is maintained, covering cases where `max_downvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes`, and all possible relationships between them.***
