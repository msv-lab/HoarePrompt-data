The code prints a hyphen ('-'), but it does not change the values of any variables. The conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is less than `y`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is less than `y`**
