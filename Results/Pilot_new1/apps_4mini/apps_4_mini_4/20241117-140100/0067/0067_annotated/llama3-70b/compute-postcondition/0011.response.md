The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `'?'` to the console. It does not change the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state remains the same regarding the values of these variables, and we note that the string `'?'` has been printed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. The value of `z` is greater than 0, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`), and the string '?' has been printed.**
