The code assigns the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the input provided by the user, converting them to integers. The initial values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, but they are integers within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, after execution, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated to the integers provided as input. The output state will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` now hold the values from the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the input integers within the range of 0 to 100**.
