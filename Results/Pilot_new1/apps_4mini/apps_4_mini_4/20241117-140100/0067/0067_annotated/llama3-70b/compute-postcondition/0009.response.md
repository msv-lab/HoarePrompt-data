The code snippet prints the string '0' to the output. It does not modify the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state is based on the initial conditions of the variables, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. The value of `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `z` is equal to 0. The function prints '0'.**
