Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the function prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, it prints '0'; otherwise, it prints '?'. If `x` is greater than `y`, the function prints '?'. In all cases, the conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are maintained.***
