Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range of 0 to 100. If `z` is equal to 0, the function prints '0'. If `z` is greater than 0, the function prints '?'. In both cases, `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x <= y + z`).***
