The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output conditions provided, we can infer that the function is expected to handle the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` which are integers constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since no specific output conditions or return values have been provided in the output, we cannot determine the exact functionality. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined based on the provided information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is currently undefined based on the provided output conditions.**
