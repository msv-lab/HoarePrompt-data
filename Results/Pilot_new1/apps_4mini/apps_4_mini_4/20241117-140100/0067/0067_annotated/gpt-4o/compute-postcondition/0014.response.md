The function `func` accepts three parameters: `x`, `y`, and `z`. Each of these parameters is an integer constrained to the range 0 to 100 inclusive. The function does not return any output or has no specified return value based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` within the range of 0 to 100, but it does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters x, y, and z, which are integers in the range 0 to 100, and does not return any value.**
