Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integer values. If `max_upvotes` (which is `x + z`) is less than `min_downvotes` (which is `y`), the output is '-'. If `max_downvotes` (which is `y + z`) is less than `min_upvotes` (which is `x`), the output is '+'. In all other cases, including when `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, the output is '?'.***
