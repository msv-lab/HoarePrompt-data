Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the output is '+'. Otherwise, the output is '?' under the conditions that `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`, `max_downvotes` is less than or equal to `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`, with `max_upvotes` defined as `x + z` and `min_downvotes` defined as `y`.***
