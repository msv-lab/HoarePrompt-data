The value of `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The previous values of the affected variables are `y` (an integer value from input) and `z` (an integer value from input). Therefore, `max_downvotes` will be calculated as the sum of `y` and `z`. The values of `x`, `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer value from input, `y` is an integer value from input, `z` is an integer value from input, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
