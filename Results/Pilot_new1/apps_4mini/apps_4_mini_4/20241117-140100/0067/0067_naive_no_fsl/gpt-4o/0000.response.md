To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and consider all possible cases.

The problem states that we have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes). The program should determine the result based on the following conditions:

1. If there are more upvotes than downvotes, the result should be "+".
2. If there are more downvotes than upvotes, the result should be "-".
3. If the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes, the result should be "0".
4. If the presence of unknown votes (`z`) creates ambiguity in the result, the program should return "?" to indicate uncertainty.

Now, let's break down the logic implemented in the program:

```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
min_upvotes = x
max_upvotes = x + z
min_downvotes = y
max_downvotes = y + z
if max_upvotes < min_downvotes:
    print('-')
elif max_downvotes < min_upvotes:
    print('+')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Logic Breakdown:
- `min_upvotes` is simply `x`, the known upvotes.
- `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, which accounts for the maximum possible upvotes if all unknown votes are upvotes.
- `min_downvotes` is `y`, the known downvotes.
- `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, which accounts for the maximum possible downvotes if all unknown votes are downvotes.

The program checks:
1. If the maximum possible upvotes (`max_upvotes`) are less than the minimum downvotes (`min_downvotes`), it prints `'-'`.
2. If the maximum possible downvotes (`max_downvotes`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`min_upvotes`), it prints `'+'`.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Potential Cases:
Now, let's analyze potential cases based on the logic:

1. **Case (3, 7, 0)**: 
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7` → Output: `-` (Correct)
   
2. **Case (2, 0, 1)**:
   - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Output: `+` (Correct)

3. **Case (1, 1, 0)**:
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1` → Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Case (0, 0, 1)**:
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Output: `?` (Correct)

5. **Case (0, 1, 1)**:
   - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1` → Output: `?` (This should be `?` because the possible outcomes are `+` or `-` depending on the unknown vote)

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where both `min_upvotes` and `min_downvotes` could be equal with one unknown vote, leading to ambiguity. Thus, it incorrectly outputs `?` instead of considering the possibility of different outcomes.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
