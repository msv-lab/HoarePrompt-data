The value of `n` is incremented by `c`, but the value of `c` is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact new value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least one character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` remains unchanged, and `n` is increased by `c`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least one character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` remains unchanged, and `n` is increased by `c**
