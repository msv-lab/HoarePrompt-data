According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string of digits, the loop will continue to iterate over its characters. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is still a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits derived from `t`, and `n` remains unchanged unless `c` is in `t_set`.

Since `s` is a non-empty string of digits, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next character `c` in the string `s`. Specifically, we should set `s` to be the string minus its first character, and the next `c` will be this new first character. The variable `n` will also change depending on whether this new `c` is in `t_set`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `s` has one less character, and we will denote the new first character of `s` as `c`. The state of `n` will also depend on whether `c` is in `t_set`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with one less character, `t_set` is a set of unique digits derived from `t`, `n` is unchanged or increased by `c` if `c` is in `t_set`**
