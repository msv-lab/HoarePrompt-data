Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty string `t` of digits. It constructs a new string `n` that consists of the digits from `s` that are also present in `t`, and then appends the entire string `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of this concatenated string `n`. If `s` is empty, `n` will only consist of the digits from `t`, and the function will return the integer value of `t`. **
