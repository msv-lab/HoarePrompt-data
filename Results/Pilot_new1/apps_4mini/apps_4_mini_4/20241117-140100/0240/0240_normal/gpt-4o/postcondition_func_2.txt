The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts a string `chars` representing shuffled digits of an integer and a non-empty string `sub` representing a substring. It generates all permutations of `chars`, checks each permutation to see if it forms a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function, and yields those that include `sub` as a substring. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded. If there are no valid permutations that yield a valid candidate, nothing is yielded. The function does not return anything; it is a generator.
