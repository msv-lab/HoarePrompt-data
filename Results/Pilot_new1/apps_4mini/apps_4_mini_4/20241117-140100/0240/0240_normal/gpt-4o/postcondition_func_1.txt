The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring of digits `sub`. It returns `True` if `sub` is found within `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to that of `sub`. If `num_str` is longer than `sub`, it will return `False`, as the lengths must match for a `True` return. If `sub` is not found in `num_str`, it also returns `False`. There is a potential issue in the code as it references `n_len`, which is not defined within the function; this could lead to a NameError. The function's intended behavior may not be fully realized due to this undefined variable.
