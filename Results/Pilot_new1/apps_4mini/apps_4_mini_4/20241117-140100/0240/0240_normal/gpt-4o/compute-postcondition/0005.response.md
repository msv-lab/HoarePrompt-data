According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. Since `perm` is currently the first permutation of `chars`, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation of `chars`. 

Given that `perm` is currently the first permutation, it will be followed by the second permutation, and so on, until all permutations have been exhausted. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the elements in `chars`, so we can infer that `perm` will change to the next permutation in the sequence.

Since no other states are specified that would need to change, we only need to adjust `perm` to reflect the next permutation in the sequence.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
