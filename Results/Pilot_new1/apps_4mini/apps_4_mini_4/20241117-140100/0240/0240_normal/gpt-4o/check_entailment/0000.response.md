To assess the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, we need to analyze each function and the overall logic.

### Problem Description
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` and a substring `sub` that contains digits from `n`.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(s, sub)`**:
   - It calculates the length of the original integer `n` by subtracting the length of `sub` from `s`.
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of characters in both `s` and `sub`.
   - It removes the characters in `sub` from `s` to get the remaining characters.
   - It generates possible numbers from the remaining characters and finds the smallest number.

2. **Function `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**:
   - It checks if `sub` is in `num_str` and verifies if the length of `num_str` matches `n_len`.
   - However, `n_len` is not defined within this function, which could lead to a `NameError`.

3. **Function `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**:
   - It generates all permutations of `chars` and checks if each permutation is a valid number using `is_valid_number`.
   - If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded.

### Output Hints
- The output hints indicate that if `sub` contains digits not present in `s`, those digits are ignored, which may lead to cases where no valid number can be generated if all characters in `s` are removed by `sub`. This is a critical point of concern.
- The second output hint points out that `is_valid_number` references `n_len`, which is not defined, leading to potential errors.

### Edge Cases
1. If `sub` contains digits that are not in `s`, the function may not handle this correctly, leading to an empty `possible_numbers` list, and hence an error when calling `min()`.
2. The `is_valid_number` function will fail due to the undefined `n_len`, causing the program to crash.

### Conclusion
Given the potential for a `NameError` in the `is_valid_number` function and the issues surrounding the handling of characters in `sub` that are not present in `s`, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program may fail when `sub` contains digits not present in `s` or when it attempts to check validity without a defined `n_len`.
