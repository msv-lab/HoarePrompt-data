The code creates a set `t_set` from the string `t`. This means that `t_set` will contain all unique characters (digits) found in `t`. The string `s` remains unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged state of `s` and the new set created from `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`**
