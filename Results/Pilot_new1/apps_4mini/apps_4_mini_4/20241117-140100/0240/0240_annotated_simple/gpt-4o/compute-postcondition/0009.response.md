According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The `permutations` function will generate each permutation one by one. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is currently the second permutation of `chars`. 

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. Since `perm` is the second permutation, the next permutation will be the third permutation of `chars`.
2. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to iterate through.

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state so that `perm` reflects the next permutation in the sequence. Specifically, we need to set `perm` to the third permutation of `chars`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as `chars` remains the same and the validity of `candidate` is not a factor for the loop's execution in this context.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`**
