The value of `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold that string representation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
