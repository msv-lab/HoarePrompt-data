The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string of digits with a maximum length of 1,000,000, while `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that may contain leading zeroes. The function generates and returns a list of possible numbers formed by inserting the string `sub` into the string `chars` at various positions.
