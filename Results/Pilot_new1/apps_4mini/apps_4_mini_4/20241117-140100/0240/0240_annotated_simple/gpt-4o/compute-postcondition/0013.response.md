According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `permutations(chars)`. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the elements in `chars`. Since `perm` is currently the third permutation of `chars`, the next permutation would be the fourth one, and the loop will continue until all permutations have been exhausted.

Given that `perm` is the third permutation, we need to adjust the state to reflect the next permutation in the sequence. Therefore, we need to set `perm` to the fourth permutation of `chars` and ensure that `candidate` is updated accordingly based on this new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`.**
