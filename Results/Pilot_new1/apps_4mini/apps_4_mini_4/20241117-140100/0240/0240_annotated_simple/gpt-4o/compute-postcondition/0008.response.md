Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, no action is taken, and nothing is yielded.***
