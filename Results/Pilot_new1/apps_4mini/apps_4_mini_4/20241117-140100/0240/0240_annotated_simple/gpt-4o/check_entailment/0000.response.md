To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code and see if it meets all the requirements outlined.

### Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(s, sub)`**:
   - This function calculates the length of the original number `n` by subtracting the length of the substring `sub` from the length of the received string `s`.
   - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in `s` and `sub`, and then adjusts the counts in `s_counter` based on the characters found in `sub`.
   - It generates the remaining characters that can be used to form the number `n` and calls `generate_possible_numbers` to find all valid permutations.

2. **Function `is_valid_number(num_str, sub)`**:
   - This checks if the substring `sub` is present in the candidate number `num_str` and verifies that the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`.

3. **Function `generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub)`**:
   - This generates all permutations of the remaining characters and yields those that are valid numbers according to `is_valid_number`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Leading Zeros**: The problem states that the decimal representation of `n` must not have leading zeros, except for the case where `n` is zero itself. However, the code does not check for leading zeros when generating permutations. This could lead to invalid numbers being considered, particularly if the first character of a permutation is '0'.

2. **Performance**: The use of permutations can lead to a combinatorial explosion, especially with a large number of characters. The program may not terminate in a reasonable time for larger inputs due to the factorial growth of permutations.

3. **Correctness of `is_valid_number`**: The function checks if `num_str` contains `sub` and if its length matches `n_len`. However, it does not ensure that the leading digit of `num_str` is not '0' (unless `num_str` is '0'). This is crucial as it contradicts the problem's requirement.

### Example of Failure

Consider the input:
```
00123
01
```
- The valid `n` should be `123` (with no leading zeros), but the program might yield permutations like `0123`, which are invalid.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, particularly regarding the handling of leading zeros, the program does not satisfy the problem's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
