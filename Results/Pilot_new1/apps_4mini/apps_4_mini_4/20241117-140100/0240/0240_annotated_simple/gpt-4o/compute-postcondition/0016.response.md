Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `chars` consisting of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It generates all permutations of `chars` and yields each permutation as a candidate if it is deemed a valid number according to the `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` function. If `chars` is empty, no candidates are yielded. The function does not return a list but instead yields valid candidates one by one, which can be iterated over. **
