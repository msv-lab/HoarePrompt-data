`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all characters in the permutation `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will have the same value as `perm`. The values of `chars` and `perm` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
