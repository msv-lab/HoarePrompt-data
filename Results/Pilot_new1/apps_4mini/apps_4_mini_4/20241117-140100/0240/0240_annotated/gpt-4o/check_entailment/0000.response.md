To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code and its annotations against the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` that contains the digits of `n` and an appended integer `k` (the number of digits in `n`). We also have a substring `sub` that is part of `n`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - It calculates the length of `n` as `n_len = len(s) - len(sub)`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to determine the characters remaining in `s` after accounting for `sub`.
   - It generates possible numbers using the remaining characters and finds the smallest one.
   - **Potential Issues**:
     - If `sub` contains more characters than `s`, it may lead to an error when trying to find the minimum value since `possible_numbers` could be empty.
     - If `s` does not contain the necessary characters to form `sub`, the same issue arises.

2. **Function 2 (`is_valid_number`)**:
   - It checks if `sub` is in `num_str` and if `num_str` is of length `n_len`.
   - However, `n_len` is not defined within this function, which means it cannot enforce the length constraint, leading to incorrect behavior.

3. **Function 3 (`generate_possible_numbers`)**:
   - It generates permutations of `chars` and checks if they are valid numbers according to `is_valid_number`.
   - If `chars` is empty or if `sub` is longer than `chars`, no candidates will be yielded, which is problematic since it would not generate potential valid numbers.

### Edge Cases
- The program does not handle cases where `sub` is longer than `s`, which violates the problem constraints.
- The lack of a proper length check in `is_valid_number` means it could return true for invalid numbers.
- The permutations might not yield valid configurations that respect the leading zero rule for the reconstructed number.

### Conclusion
Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the handling of `sub` and the generation of valid numbers does not guarantee that the smallest valid `n` is returned.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure
For instance, if `s = "003512"` and `sub = "021"`, the program may yield a result that doesn't respect the leading zero rule or may fail to account for all valid permutations of the characters. The absence of a proper length check and the potential for empty permutations means it can produce incorrect outputs.
