The `candidate` variable is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it will be a string formed by concatenating all elements of the iterable `perm`. Since `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will hold that permutation as a string. The initial state indicates that `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, and `perm` is derived from it, but the exact value of `perm` is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment without changing other variables.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**
