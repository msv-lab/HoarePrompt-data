The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It calculates the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters of `sub`. It then generates a list of possible numbers from the remaining characters and returns the minimum value from that list. If `sub` contains more characters than `s`, or if `s` does not contain the necessary characters to form `sub`, the function may not behave as expected, potentially leading to an error when trying to find the minimum value. Additionally, if `possible_numbers` is empty, calling `min()` will raise a `ValueError`.
