Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function, the function yields `candidate`. There are no other conditions or actions specified for the else part, meaning that if `candidate` is not valid, nothing occurs.***
