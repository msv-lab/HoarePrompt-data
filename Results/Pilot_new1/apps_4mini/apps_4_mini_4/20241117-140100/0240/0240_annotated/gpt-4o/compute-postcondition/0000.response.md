According to the code, the loop executes if there are permutations to generate from the `chars` string. The `permutations` function will produce results as long as `chars` is not empty. Given that `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it can be empty or contain digits. 

For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one digit (i.e., it cannot be an empty string). The variable `perm` will represent each permutation generated from the `chars` string. 

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `chars` is not empty and that `perm` can start with the first permutation of the characters in `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
