Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and `n` is either the first character of `s` or the first character of `s` concatenated with the next character in `s`. If `c`, the next character in `s`, is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated by concatenating `c` to its previous value. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains unchanged.***
