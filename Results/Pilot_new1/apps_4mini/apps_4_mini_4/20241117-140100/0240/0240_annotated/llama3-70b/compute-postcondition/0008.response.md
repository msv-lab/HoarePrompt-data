Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is either the first character of `s` or the first character of `s` concatenated with `c` if `c` (the second character of `s`) is in `t_set`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains as the first character of `s`.***
