According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. Given that `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, if `s` is empty, the loop will not execute. 

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `s` is not an empty string. Additionally, since `c` will take on the value of each character in `s`, we should specify that `c` will be the first character of `s` during the first iteration. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state as follows:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
