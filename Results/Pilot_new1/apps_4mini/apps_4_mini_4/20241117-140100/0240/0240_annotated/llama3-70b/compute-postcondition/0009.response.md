According to the code, the loop iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as there are more characters in `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, and `c` is the current character being processed. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variable `c` to the next character in the string `s`. If `c` is the last character of `s`, the loop will not execute again. However, since `s` is a non-empty string, it must contain at least one more character after the current one for the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to ensure that `c` is adjusted to the next character in `s`, and since `n` depends on whether `c` is in `t_set`, we also need to consider that `n` may need to be updated accordingly based on the next character.

Given that `s` is a non-empty string, we can conclude that after the current character `c`, there is at least one more character left in `s` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is either the first character of `s` or the first character of `s` concatenated with the next character in `s` if the next character is in `t_set`, `c` is the next character in `s`.**
