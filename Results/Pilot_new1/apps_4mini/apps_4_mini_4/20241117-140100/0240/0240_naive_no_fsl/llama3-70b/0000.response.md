To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its functionality against the problem description and potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
1. The input consists of two strings: 
   - `s`: a shuffled string containing the digits of `n` and the count of digits in `n` (denoted as `k`).
   - `t`: a non-empty substring of `n`.

2. The goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` that could produce the given input.

### Program Analysis
The program defines a function `func_1` that:
- Takes the input strings `s` and `t`.
- Creates a set of characters from `t` (i.e., `t_set`).
- Iterates through each character in `s`, and if the character is found in `t_set`, it adds it to the string `n`.
- Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and converts the resulting string to an integer.

### Issue Identification
The program does not consider the following important points:
1. **Leading Zeros**: The program constructs `n` by appending characters from `s` that are in `t`. If `n` starts with a '0' and is not the number zero itself, it would not be a valid representation of an integer.
2. **Smallest Possible Integer**: The program does not ensure that the resulting integer `n` is the smallest possible one. It simply collects digits from `s` and appends `t`, which may not yield the smallest `n`.

### Counterexample
Let's consider an input case that could demonstrate the failure of the program:

**Input:**
```
000123
01
```

**Expected Output:**
The smallest integer `n` that contains the substring `01` and can be formed from `000123` is `12301`.

**What the Program Does:**
- It would collect characters from `s` that are in `t`, resulting in `n` being `001`.
- It then appends `t` to `n`, resulting in `n = 00101`, which converts to `101`.

This output `101` is not the smallest integer that can be formed, as `12301` is smaller.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly handle the requirement to form the smallest integer `n` and can produce invalid outputs due to leading zeros, it fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
