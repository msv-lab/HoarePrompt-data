Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` (ranging from 0 to 10^9) and rounds it to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` (the remainder when divided by 10) is 5 or less, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10; if the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10. The result is printed but not returned. **
