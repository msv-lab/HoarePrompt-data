The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9, inclusive. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9**
