The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to operate with a non-negative integer `n` that falls within the range of 0 to 10^9. However, since no parameters are explicitly passed to the function, the specific behavior or return value based on `n` cannot be determined from the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is unclear without further details regarding how `n` is utilized or computed within the function.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is not specified based on the provided information.**
