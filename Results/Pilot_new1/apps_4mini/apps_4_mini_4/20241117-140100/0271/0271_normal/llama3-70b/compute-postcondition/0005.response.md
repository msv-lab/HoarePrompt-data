The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively removes the last digit of `n` by rounding it down to the nearest multiple of 10. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, not divisible by 10, and the last digit (remainder when divided by 10) is between 0 and 5, the result will be `n` rounded down to the nearest lower multiple of 10.

Since `n` is not divisible by 10, `n % 10` will yield a value between 1 and 5. Thus, `n - n % 10` will yield a value that is `n` minus an integer between 1 and 5, resulting in a value that is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the fact that `n` is unchanged and the computed value is also specified.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5; the result of `n - n % 10` is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`.**
