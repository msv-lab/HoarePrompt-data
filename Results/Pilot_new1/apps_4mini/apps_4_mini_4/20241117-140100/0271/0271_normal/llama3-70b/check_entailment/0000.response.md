To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the code.

### Problem Description:
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it should be considered rounded. The rounding rules are:
- If `n` ends with 0, return `n`.
- If `n` ends with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- If `n` ends with 6, 7, 8, or 9, round up to the nearest multiple of 10.

### Provided Program:
```python
n = int(input())
if n % 10 == 0:
    print(n)
elif n % 10 <= 5:
    print(n - n % 10)
else:
    print(n + (10 - n % 10))
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Case when `n % 10 == 0`**: The program correctly returns `n`, as it is already rounded.
2. **Case when `n % 10 <= 5`**: The program calculates `n - n % 10`, which correctly rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 for values 1 through 5.
3. **Case when `n % 10 > 5`**: The program calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which correctly rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 for values 6 through 9.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 0`: The program outputs `0`, which is correct.
- For `n = 5`: The program outputs `0`, which is one of the correct answers (the other being `10`).
- For `n = 10`: The program outputs `10`, which is correct.
- For `n = 11`: The program outputs `10`, which is correct.
- For `n = 15`: The program outputs `10`, which is correct.
- For `n = 16`: The program outputs `20`, which is correct.
- For `n = 19`: The program outputs `20`, which is correct.
- For `n = 20`: The program outputs `20`, which is correct.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe the program's behavior accurately. They confirm that the program handles rounding correctly based on the last digit of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all specified cases correctly and adheres to the problem description. There are no edge cases that the program fails to handle, and all examples provided in the problem description yield the correct results.

Correctness: **True**.
