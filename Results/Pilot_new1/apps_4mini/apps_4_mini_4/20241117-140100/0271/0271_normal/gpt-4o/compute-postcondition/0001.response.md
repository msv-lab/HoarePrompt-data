The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer in the range from 0 to 10^9, `remainder` will take a value from 0 to 9, depending on the specific value of `n`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9**
