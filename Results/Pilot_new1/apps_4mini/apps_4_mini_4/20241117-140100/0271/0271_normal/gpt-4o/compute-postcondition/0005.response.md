The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. The variable `n` is a non-negative integer within the range from 0 to 10^9, and `remainder` is an integer ranging from 6 to 9. Therefore, the expression `(10 - remainder)` will yield values from 1 to 4, depending on the value of `remainder`. 

- If `remainder` is 6, then `result = n + (10 - 6) = n + 4`.
- If `remainder` is 7, then `result = n + (10 - 7) = n + 3`.
- If `remainder` is 8, then `result = n + (10 - 8) = n + 2`.
- If `remainder` is 9, then `result = n + (10 - 9) = n + 1`.

Thus, the output state reflects the possible values of `result` based on the values of `n` and `remainder`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer from 6 to 9; `result` is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`**
