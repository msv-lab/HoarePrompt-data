Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the program arises in the handling of numbers that are exactly halfway between two multiples of ten. Specifically, when `n` is a number like 5, the program will round it to 10, but according to the problem description, it is stated that rounding to 0 is also a valid option. 

The program does not account for the fact that if `n` is exactly halfway (like 5), both rounding options (to 0 or to 10) are correct. The current implementation will always round to the higher multiple of ten when `n % 10` is greater than 5, which means it does not provide the option to round down to 0 when that is also a valid choice. 

For example:
- Input: `5` → Output: `10` (but `0` is also a valid output)
- Input: `15` → Output: `20` (but `10` is also a valid output)

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
