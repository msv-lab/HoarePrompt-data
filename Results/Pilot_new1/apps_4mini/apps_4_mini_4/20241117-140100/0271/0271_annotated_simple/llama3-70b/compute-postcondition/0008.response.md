Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is not a multiple of 10. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the output is `n - n % 10`, which rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the output is `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which rounds `n` up to the nearest multiple of 10. Thus, the output will be either a lower or upper multiple of 10 depending on the value of `n % 10`.***
