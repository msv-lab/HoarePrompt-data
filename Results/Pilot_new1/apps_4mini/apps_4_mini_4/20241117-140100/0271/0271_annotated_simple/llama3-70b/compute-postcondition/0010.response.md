The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The output behavior of the function is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, without additional details on the output, I cannot specify the return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the output behavior is not specified.**
