Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the function prints the smallest multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`. Thus, the output will be either `n`, the lower multiple of 10, or the upper multiple of 10, depending on the value of `n`.***
