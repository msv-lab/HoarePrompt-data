The code assigns the value of `n % 10` to the variable `remainder`. The value of `n` is an input integer that ranges from 0 to 10^9. The modulo operation will yield the last digit of `n`, which can be any integer from 0 to 9 depending on the specific value of `n`. The output state reflects that the variable `remainder` now holds the last digit of `n`, while `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n` (0 to 9)**
