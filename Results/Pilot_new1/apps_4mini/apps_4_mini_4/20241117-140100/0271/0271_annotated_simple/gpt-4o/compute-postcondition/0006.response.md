Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is the last digit of `n` (0 to 9). If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is set to `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is set to `n + (10 - remainder)`. This ensures that `result` is the nearest lower multiple of 10 when `remainder` is 5 or less, and the nearest higher multiple of 10 when `remainder` is greater than 5.***
