To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze its logic and see if it adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - \( n \) and \( k \) can be extremely large (up to \( 10^{18} \)).
   - The number of days is \( 2^n \), which can also be extremely large.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - The output must be an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) such that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.
   - The output values must be taken modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

3. **Logic of the Birthday Problem**:
   - The probability that at least two people share a birthday is \( 1 - P(\text{all different}) \).
   - The probability that all \( k \) people have different birthdays is given by:
     \[
     P(\text{all different}) = \frac{2^n \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times ... \times (2^n - k + 1)}{(2^n)^k}
     \]
   - This leads to the fraction \( \frac{(2^n)(2^n - 1)(2^n - 2)...(2^n - k + 1)}{(2^n)^k} \).

### Code Review:
1. The function `func_1` calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability of all different birthdays.
2. It uses a loop to compute the numerator by multiplying \( total\_days - i \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \).
3. The denominator is simply \( total\_days^k \).
4. The GCD is computed to reduce the fraction before taking modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Potential Issues:
1. **Overflow**: The values \( total_days \) and products in the numerator can become extremely large (beyond typical integer limits), especially since \( n \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \).
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( k > 2^n \), it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. The code does not handle this case explicitly.
   - The program should check for cases where \( k \) is greater than \( total_days \) and return \( 1, 1 \) directly, as the probability would be \( 1 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the case where \( k > 2^n \). For example, if \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 3 \), the output should be \( 1, 1 \) because it's impossible for three people to have different birthdays when there are only two days. However, the program will attempt to compute the probability leading to incorrect results or overflow.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
