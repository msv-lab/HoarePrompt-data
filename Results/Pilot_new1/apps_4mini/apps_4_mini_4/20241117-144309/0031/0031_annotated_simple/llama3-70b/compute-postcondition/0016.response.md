The value of `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` is not specified, but it is affected by this operation. The `numerator` is also mentioned, but it remains unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `denominator`.

Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; `numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`, and `denominator` is updated to `denominator // gcd`.**
