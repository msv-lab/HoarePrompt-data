The value of `numerator` is updated by performing integer division with `gcd`. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, `numerator //= gcd` effectively reduces `numerator` by dividing it by `gcd`. The new value of `numerator` will be `numerator` divided by `gcd`. The state of `denominator` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; `numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`.**
