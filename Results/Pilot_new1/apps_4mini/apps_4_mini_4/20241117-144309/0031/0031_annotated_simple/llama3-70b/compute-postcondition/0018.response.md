The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, with the constraints that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\) and \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). After executing the function body, it returns the values of `numerator` and `denominator` after applying the modulo operation with 10. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the results of the modulo operation of `numerator` and `denominator` with 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, both positive integers, and returns the values of `numerator` and `denominator` after applying the modulo operation with 10.**
