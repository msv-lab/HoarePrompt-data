Output State: **If k is greater than 0, then after the loop executes k times, `numerator` is the product of `total_days` decreasing by 1 for each iteration, and `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of (k times n). If k is 0, the loop does not execute, and `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 1.**
