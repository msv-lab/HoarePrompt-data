According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. The value of `k` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 2. The other variables do not need to be adjusted as they are not directly affected by the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 1, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 raised to the power of `n` times (2 raised to the power of `n` - 1), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of (2*n), `i` is 2**
