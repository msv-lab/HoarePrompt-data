According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2, and `i` should be updated to 3, as it will increment in the next iteration.

State: **`total_days` is 2^n, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD;`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 2**
