The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, and `k` must satisfy the condition 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If this condition is not met, there is no output or return statement executed. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, and print (1, 1) if `k` exceeds 2 raised to the power of `n`. If `k` does not exceed that value, the function does not produce any output or return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and prints (1, 1) if `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`. If `k` is not greater, there is no output or return.**
