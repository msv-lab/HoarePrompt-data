To provide the output state, we need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the provided code snippet step by step.

Given:
- `numerator` is equal to the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`, modulo `MOD`.
- `denominator` is equal to `(total_days^k) % MOD`.
- `total_days` is `2^n`.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `1` for the loop to execute; if `k` is `0`, `numerator` remains `1`, and `denominator` remains `1`.
- `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`.
- `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`.
- `p_shared` is assigned the value of `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
- `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
- `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
- `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`.
- `A` is divided by `g`.
- `B` is assigned the value of `B // g`.

The print statement outputs `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.

Now, we assume `func_1(A, B)` returns a value that allows us to compute the final values of `A` and `B`. However, without specific values for `n`, `k`, `MOD`, and the result of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact numeric output.

Thus, the output state will describe the values of `A` and `B` after the calculations, based on the transformations applied to them, but will remain abstract due to the lack of specific numeric values.

Output State: **`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and the final output is `A % MOD` and `B % MOD` after division and integer division by `g`.**
