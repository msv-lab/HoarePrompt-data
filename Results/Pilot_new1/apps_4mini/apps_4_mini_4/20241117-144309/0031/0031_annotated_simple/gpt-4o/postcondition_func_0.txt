The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is initially 0, it returns `a` directly. If `b` is non-zero, it iteratively applies the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns the GCD. The function does not handle negative values or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected results.
