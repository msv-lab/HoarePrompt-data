The variable `denominator` is assigned the value of 1. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` (which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18), `total_days` (which is 2 raised to the power of `n`), and `numerator` (which is 1). The assignment of `denominator` does not affect these variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`; `numerator` is 1; `denominator` is 1**
