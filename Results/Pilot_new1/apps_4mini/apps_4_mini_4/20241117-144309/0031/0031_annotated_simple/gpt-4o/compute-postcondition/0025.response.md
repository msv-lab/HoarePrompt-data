Output State: **`numerator` is equal to the product of (total_days - i) for i from 0 to k-1, modulo MOD; `denominator` is equal to (total_days^k) % MOD; `total_days` is 2^n; `k` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute; if `k` is 0, `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains 1; `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`; `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is assigned the value of (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`; `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`; `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B); A` is divided by `g`.**
