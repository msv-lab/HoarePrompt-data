According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\), it ensures that the loop will execute at least twice. At the end of the last iteration, the variable `i` will be equal to \(k-1\). 

Before the loop starts, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 1, and `denominator` is 1, which do not affect the execution of the loop itself. However, the state of `i` needs to be initialized for the loop execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be at least 2, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
