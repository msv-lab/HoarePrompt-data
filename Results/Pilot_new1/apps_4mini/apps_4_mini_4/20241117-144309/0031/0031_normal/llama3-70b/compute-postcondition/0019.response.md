Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the total number of days as \(2^n\), and then computes the numerator and denominator based on a loop that runs `k` times. After calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator, it reduces them and returns the results of `numerator % (10^6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10^6 + 3)`. The function does not handle cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `total_days`, which could lead to a numerator of 0 if `k` is sufficiently large.**
