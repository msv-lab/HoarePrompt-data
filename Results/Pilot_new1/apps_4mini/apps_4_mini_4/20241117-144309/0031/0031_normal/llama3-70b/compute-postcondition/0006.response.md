According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next state for `i` should be 1. The value of `k` does not need to be adjusted since it is still within the specified range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 1**
