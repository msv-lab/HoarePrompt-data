The statement `numerator //= gcd` modifies the value of `numerator` by performing integer division with `gcd`. However, since the initial state specifies that the `gcd` value does not affect the other variables, we cannot determine the exact new value of `numerator` without knowing its initial value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the operation without changing the overall state of the other variables.

Output State: **`numerator` is updated to `numerator // gcd`, and the `gcd` value does not affect the other variables.**
