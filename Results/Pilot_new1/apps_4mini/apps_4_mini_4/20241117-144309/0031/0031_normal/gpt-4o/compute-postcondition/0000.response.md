The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `MOD`, which is calculated as \(10^6 + 3\). This does not affect the values of `n` or `k`, which remain as positive integers within their specified ranges. The value of `MOD` is a constant and does not depend on `n` or `k`.

The output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the newly assigned value of `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**
