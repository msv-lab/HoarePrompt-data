To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`
   - `p_total` is the value of `denominator`
   - `p_shared` is calculated as `(denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD`
   - `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`
   - `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`
   - `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The statement `A //= g` performs an integer division of `A` by `g`, updating `A` with the result of this division.

3. **Variable Values**:
   - The values of `A`, `B`, and `g` are affected by the execution of the code. The exact values of `A` and `g` depend on the calculations and the function `func_1`, which is not provided. However, we can state that `A` will now hold the value of `p_shared // g`.

4. **Output State**:
   - The state of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, and `B` remains unchanged, while `A` is modified.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `A` while maintaining the other variables' values.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (denominator - numerator + MOD) % MOD, `A` is updated to p_shared // g, `B` is the value of `p_total`**.
