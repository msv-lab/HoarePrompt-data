The code prints the values `1` and `1`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` are not affected by this print operation. The output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables along with the printed output. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`; printed output is 1, 1**
