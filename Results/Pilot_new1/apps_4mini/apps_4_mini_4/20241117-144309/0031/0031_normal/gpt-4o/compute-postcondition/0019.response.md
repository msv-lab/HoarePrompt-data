Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, which depends on the value of `k`: if k is 0, `numerator` is 1; if k > 0 and k <= `total_days`, `numerator` is the product of `total_days`, `total_days - 1`, ..., `total_days - (k - 1)` modulo `MOD`; if k > `total_days`, `numerator` involves negative values which may not be handled properly.**
