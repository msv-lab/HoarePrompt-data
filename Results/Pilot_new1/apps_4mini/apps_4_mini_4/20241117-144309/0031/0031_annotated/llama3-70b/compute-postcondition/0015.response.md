The value of `numerator` is assigned the result of `numerator //= gcd`, which means `numerator` is divided by `gcd`. Given that `numerator` is 0 and `gcd` is 2^k, the result of the integer division will still be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 2^k, `gcd` is 2^k.

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 2^k, `gcd` is 2^k**
