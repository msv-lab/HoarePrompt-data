The `denominator` is updated by performing an integer division of `denominator` by `gcd`. Given that `denominator` is `2^k` and `gcd` is also `2^k`, the result of the operation `denominator //= gcd` will be `2^k // 2^k`, which equals `1`. 

Thus, after executing the code, `denominator` will be `1`, while `numerator` and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 2^k.

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 2^k**
