Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the total number of days as `2^n`, and computes a fraction represented by `numerator` and `denominator`. After simplifying the fraction using the greatest common divisor (gcd), it returns the tuple of `(0, 1)` regardless of the values of `n` and `k`, as the numerator always evaluates to 0 after the loop. **
