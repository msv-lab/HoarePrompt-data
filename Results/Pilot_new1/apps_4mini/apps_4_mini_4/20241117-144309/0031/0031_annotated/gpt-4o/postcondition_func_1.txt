The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `n` must be between 1 and \(10^{18}\) and `k` must be between 2 and \(10^{18}\). If `k` is greater than \(2^n\), it prints (1, 1) and returns without performing further calculations. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), it calculates a probability related to the number of ways to choose items without shared elements and prints the reduced fraction of shared outcomes over total outcomes modulo \(10^6 + 3\).
