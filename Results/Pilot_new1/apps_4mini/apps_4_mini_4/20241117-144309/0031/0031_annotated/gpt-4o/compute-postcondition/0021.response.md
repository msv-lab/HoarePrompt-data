To analyze the given code snippet, we start with the initial state where `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator` and `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. 

The code then calculates `p_shared` using the formula:
```
p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
```

1. `p_total` holds the value of `denominator`.
2. `p_no_shared` holds the value of `numerator`.
3. The expression `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD` is evaluated:
   - First, we subtract `p_no_shared` from `p_total`.
   - Then, we add `MOD` to ensure the result is non-negative.
   - Finally, we take the modulus with `MOD` to get `p_shared`.

The states of `p_no_shared` and `p_total` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and the newly calculated `p_shared`.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD**
