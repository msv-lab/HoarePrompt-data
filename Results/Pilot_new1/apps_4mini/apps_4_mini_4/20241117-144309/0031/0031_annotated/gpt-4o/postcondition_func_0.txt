The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers. If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns `a` (or `b`, since they are the same). If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `b`, and if `a` is greater than `b`, it computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. The function does not handle negative integers or zero as valid inputs.
