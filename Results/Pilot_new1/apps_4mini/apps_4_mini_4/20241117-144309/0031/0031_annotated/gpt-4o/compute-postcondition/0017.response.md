According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \), for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2, and `i` needs to be updated to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than 2; `total_days` is 2^n; `denominator` is updated to 2^(3n) % MOD; `i` is 3**
