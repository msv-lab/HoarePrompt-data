The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
