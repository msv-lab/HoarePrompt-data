To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description and annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of this sequence should be maximal.
3. If such a sequence is not possible, we must return -1.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program calculates the minimum sum required for `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the smallest possible sum for `k` distinct positive integers.
2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program correctly returns -1, indicating that it's impossible to form such a sequence.
3. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the program calculates a base sequence using `d = n // min_sum`, which scales the minimum sequence to fit within `n`.
4. The program then computes the remainder `remainder = n - d * min_sum` and distributes this remainder across the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Edge Cases:
The program handles the case where `k` is large enough that the minimum required sum exceeds `n`, returning -1 correctly. However, let's analyze cases where the GCD might not be maximal.

### Example Cases:
1. **Case where n = 6, k = 3:**
   - Minimum sum = `3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`. 
   - Sequence = `[1, 2, 3]` (GCD = 1). This is valid.
   
2. **Case where n = 8, k = 2:**
   - Minimum sum = `2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 3`.
   - Sequence can be `[2, 6]` (GCD = 2). This is valid.

3. **Case where n = 5, k = 3:**
   - Minimum sum = `3 * (3 + 1) // 2 = 6`. 
   - Returns -1, which is correct.

### Potential Issue:
The program does not guarantee that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximal. For example:
- If `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum is 6, and the program might return `[2, 4, 6]` (GCD = 2). However, a better sequence could be `[3, 4, 5]` (GCD = 1) or `[4, 4, 4]` (which is invalid due to strict increase).
- The program does not ensure that the GCD is maximized; it only ensures the sum is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximal, which is a requirement in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
