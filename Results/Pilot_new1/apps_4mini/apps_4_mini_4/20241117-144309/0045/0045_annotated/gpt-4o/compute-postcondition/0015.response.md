Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)]. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop or statement exits, indicating that the remaining value has been fully accounted for; otherwise, the execution continues beyond this point.***
