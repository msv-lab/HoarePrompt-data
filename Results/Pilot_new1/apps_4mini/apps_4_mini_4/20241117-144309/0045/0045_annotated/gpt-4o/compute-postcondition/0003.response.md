Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum cannot be achieved with the given `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, no action is taken, and the function does not return a value.***
