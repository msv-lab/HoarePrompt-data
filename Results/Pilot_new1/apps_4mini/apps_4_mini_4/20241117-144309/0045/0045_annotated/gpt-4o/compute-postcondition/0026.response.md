The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In the execution of the function, there are two cases to consider:

- **Case 1**: If the minimum required sum, calculated as `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum required sum cannot be achieved with the given `n`. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, no action is taken, and the function does not return a value.

- **Case 2**: If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function returns a sequence. This sequence is either `[(d * 1), (d * 2), ..., (d * k)]` if the remainder is 0, or the last `min(remainder, k)` elements of the sequence incremented by 1 if the remainder is greater than 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the minimum required sum can be achieved with `n`, and return either -1 or a specific sequence based on the calculations involving `n` and `k`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both positive integers. It returns -1 if the minimum required sum cannot be achieved; otherwise, it returns a sequence based on the values of n and k.**
