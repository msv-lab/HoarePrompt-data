According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0, as the range for `i` is from `k - 1` to `0`, inclusive. Given that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is also a positive integer, we know that `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the value of `i` will be initialized to `k - 1`, which means that `k` must be at least 1 for `i` to have a valid starting point. Additionally, we need to ensure that the list `sequence` has been properly initialized with `k` elements, which it is, since its length is `k`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the conditions are already satisfied with `k` being a positive integer. The initial values of `i` and the sequence are also valid.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * k)], `i` is `k - 1`**
