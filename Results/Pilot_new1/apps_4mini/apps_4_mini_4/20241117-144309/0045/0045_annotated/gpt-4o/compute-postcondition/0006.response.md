The code creates a list called `sequence`, which is generated using a list comprehension. The list comprehension iterates over a range object created from `k`, which means it will generate `k` elements. Each element of the sequence is calculated as `d * (i + 1)`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`. 

The value of `d` is previously calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `d` is determined by how many times `min_sum` fits into `n`.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and the generated `sequence` list. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * k)]**
