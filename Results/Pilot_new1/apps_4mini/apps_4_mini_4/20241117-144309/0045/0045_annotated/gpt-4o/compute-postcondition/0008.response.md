Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * k)], `i` is `k - 1`, and the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` is equal to 0.***
