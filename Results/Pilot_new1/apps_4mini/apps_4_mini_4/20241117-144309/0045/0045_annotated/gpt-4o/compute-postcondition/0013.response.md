To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop statement.

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it starts from `k - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1` (not inclusive). 
2. The current value of `i` is `k - 1`, which is the last valid index for the loop to execute.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 2` in the next iteration.

Now, let's summarize the necessary adjustments based on the current state:

- The current value of `i` is `k - 1`, so for the next iteration, it will be `k - 2`.
- Since `remainder` is decreased by 1, we need to ensure that the `remainder` is still valid for the next iteration.
- As `i` decrements to `k - 2`, it does not affect the other variables directly, but we must ensure that the loop can still execute based on the conditions of `k` and `i`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:

- `i` should be adjusted to `k - 2` for the next iteration.
- Since the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`, and `k` is a positive integer, we do not need to change `k` or `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `i` is `k - 2`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1.**
