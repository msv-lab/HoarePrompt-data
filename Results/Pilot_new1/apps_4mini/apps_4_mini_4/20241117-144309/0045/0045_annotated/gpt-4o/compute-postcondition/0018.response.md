According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `k - 1` and decrements `i` on each iteration until it reaches `-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be `0`, since the loop decrements `i` after each iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `-1`, which is the condition that will end the loop. 

Thus, we need to reflect that `i` is now `0` at the start of the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted, as `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `remainder` do not change due to the loop execution.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `remainder` is decremented by 1, `i` is 0**
