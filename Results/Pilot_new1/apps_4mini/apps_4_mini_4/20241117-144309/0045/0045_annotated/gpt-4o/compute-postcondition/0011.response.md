The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `sequence` contains values based on the calculation of `d` multiplied by integers from 1 to `k`. Since `i` is `k - 1`, we are specifically updating the last element of the list `sequence`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `i` is `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2, `d` is the result of `n // min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values [(d * (1)), (d * (2)), ..., (d * (k - 1)), (d * k + 1)], `i` is `k - 1**
