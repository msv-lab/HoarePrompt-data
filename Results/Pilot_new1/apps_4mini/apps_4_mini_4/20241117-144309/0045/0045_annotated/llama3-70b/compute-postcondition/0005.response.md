According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue executing as long as `b` is non-zero (i.e., `b` evaluates to true). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b`, and the previous value of `b` is greater than 0. This means that `b` could potentially be 0 if `a` is less than or equal to the previous value of `b`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states so that `b` is greater than 0 after the modulo operation. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` is greater than the previous value of `b` to guarantee that `b` will remain non-zero.

State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the result of the operation `a % b` and `a` is greater than the previous value of `b`**
