To calculate the value of `remainder`, we start with the initial values provided:

1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. `k` is a positive integer.
3. `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
4. `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`.

Now, the code executes the line:
```
remainder = n - d * min_sum
```

This line computes the value of `remainder` by subtracting the product of `d` and `min_sum` from `n`. 

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` after this calculation. Since `d` is derived from `n` and `min_sum`, we can express `remainder` as `n - (n // min_sum) * min_sum`.

Therefore, the output state will include the variables `n`, `min_sum`, `d`, and the newly calculated `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.**
