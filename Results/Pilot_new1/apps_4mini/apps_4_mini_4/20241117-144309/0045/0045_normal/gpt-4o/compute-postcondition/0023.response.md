According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 2`, which is one less than `k - 3`. Additionally, since the loop iterates in reverse, `i` will be decremented in the next iteration. 

No other states need to be adjusted, as the other variables (`n`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence[i]`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute again based on the provided information.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
