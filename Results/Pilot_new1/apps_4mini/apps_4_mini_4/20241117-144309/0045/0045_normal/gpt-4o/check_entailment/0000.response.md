To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break down the code and analyze it step by step.

### Problem Description:
We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n` and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximal. If it's impossible to create such a sequence, we should return -1.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The code calculates the minimum sum required to create a sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest `k` positive integers are `1, 2, ..., k`, which sum to this value.

2. **Feasibility Check**: It checks if `min_sum` exceeds `n`. If it does, it returns -1. This is also correct.

3. **GCD Calculation**: The code calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which determines how many times the minimum sum can fit into `n`. This is used to scale the sequence.

4. **Sequence Construction**: The sequence is constructed as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`, which generates the sequence `d, 2d, ..., kd`.

5. **Remainder Distribution**: The code then distributes any remaining value from `n` after subtracting `d * min_sum` across the last elements of the sequence. This is done in a way that maintains the strictly increasing property of the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
- If `k = 0`, the code does not handle this case since `k` is always assumed to be at least 1 according to the problem constraints.
- If `n` is less than the minimum sum, it correctly returns -1.
- If `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, it will return the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]` which is valid.
- The code does not explicitly check for the case where the sequence might exceed `n` after distributing the remainder, but this is mitigated by the way the remainder is distributed.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints provide a good summary of the function's behavior. They state that the function checks the minimum sum and returns -1 if it exceeds `n`, which is accurate. The hints also mention the distribution of the remainder, which aligns with the code's logic.

### Conclusion:
While the code seems to handle most cases correctly, it does not explicitly account for `k = 0`, which is not a valid input based on the problem constraints but is a potential edge case in general programming logic. However, since the problem constraints specify that `k` is at least 1, this is not a practical concern in this instance.

Therefore, after reviewing the code and the output hints, it appears that the code correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**.
