The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first checks if the minimum sum required to distribute `k` positive integers (which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`) exceeds `n`. If it does, the function returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n` and distributes the remainder across the first `k` integers, returning this modified sequence. If `k` is 0, the function will return an empty sequence since no distribution is possible.
