Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `remainder` is not equal to 0, the program continues executing without breaking.**
