The value of `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is a positive integer, this formula computes the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and since both are positive integers within the specified range, the output state reflects the computation of `min_sum`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2**
