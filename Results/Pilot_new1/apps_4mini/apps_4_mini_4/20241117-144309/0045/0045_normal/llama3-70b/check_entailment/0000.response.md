To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and see if it handles all edge cases correctly.

### Problem Description Recap:
The program is supposed to generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that their sum equals `n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximal. If such a sequence is not possible, it should output `-1`.

### Code Analysis:
1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If `n` is less than `k`, it outputs `-1`, which is correct because it is impossible to have `k` distinct positive integers that sum to `n`.
   
2. It initializes an empty list `seq` and enters a loop to add integers from `1` to `k`. For each integer `i`, it checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. If so, it appends `i` to `seq` and subtracts `i` from `n`. This continues until it either adds `k` elements or runs out of sufficient `n`.

3. After the loop, if the length of `seq` is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`, indicating that it could not find a valid sequence.

4. If it successfully constructs a list of length `k`, it prints the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n` is exactly equal to the sum of the first `k` positive integers (which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`). The program should return the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]`.
- When `n` is less than the sum of the first `k` integers, which is already handled by the check `if n < k`.
- When `n` is larger than `k`, but not enough to allow for a strictly increasing sequence. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]` sums to `10`, which is valid.
- However, if `n` is large but `k` is such that the only possible sequence would not be strictly increasing (e.g., if `n` is very large relative to `k`), the program does not account for maximizing the GCD.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints mention that the function calculates the GCD of two integers, but this is not directly relevant to the main task of generating the sequence. The hints do not provide any additional information that contradicts the logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program does not ensure that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximal. It only constructs a sequence of the first `k` integers, which may not yield the highest GCD possible. For example, if `n = 12` and `k = 3`, the program outputs `[1, 2, 3]` (GCD = 1), but a better sequence could be `[2, 4, 6]` (GCD = 2), which also sums to `12`. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement of maximizing the GCD in all cases.

Correctness: **False**.
