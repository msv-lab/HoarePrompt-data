According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero (i.e., truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the remainder of the initial value of `b` divided by the initial value of `a`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero. Since `b` is the remainder of the initial value of `b` divided by the initial value of `a`, it is possible for `b` to be zero if the initial value of `b` was a multiple of the initial value of `a`. Therefore, to ensure that `b` is non-zero, we need to adjust the initial value of `b` so that it is not a multiple of `a`.

State: **`a` is the initial value of `b`, `b` is not a multiple of the initial value of `a`**
