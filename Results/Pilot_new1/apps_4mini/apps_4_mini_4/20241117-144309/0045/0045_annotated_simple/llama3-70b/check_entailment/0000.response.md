To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We are given two positive integers \( n \) and \( k \).
2. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of \( k \) positive integers such that:
   - Their sum equals \( n \).
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized.
3. If no such sequence exists, the output should be -1.

### Provided Code Analysis:
The provided code snippet is:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    return a
```
This function computes the GCD of \( a \) and \( b \) using the Euclidean algorithm. The comments indicate that the final value of \( a \) is the GCD of \( n \) and \( k \).

### Missing Logic:
1. The code only calculates the GCD of \( n \) and \( k \) but does not construct the strictly increasing sequence or check if such a sequence can be formed.
2. The problem requires generating a sequence of \( k \) integers that sum to \( n \) and have a maximal GCD, which the provided code does not address.
3. The program does not handle cases where it is impossible to create such a sequence, such as when \( n < \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) (the minimum sum of the first \( k \) positive integers).

### Example Cases:
- For the input \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - The minimum sum for 3 positive integers (1, 2, 3) is \( 6 \). Since \( 5 < 6 \), the output should be -1. The provided code does not account for this, leading to incorrect behavior.
  
- For the input \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 3 \):
  - A valid sequence could be \( 1, 2, 3 \) which sums to 6 and has a GCD of 1. However, the code does not generate this sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as it does not generate the required sequence or handle cases where no sequence is possible.

Correctness: **False**
