According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (or truthy), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is determined by `k % (n % k)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be non-zero.

Currently, `a` is `n % k`, and `b` is `k % (n % k)`. For `b` to be non-zero, `k` must not be a multiple of `n % k`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `k` is not equal to `0` and that `n % k` is not equal to `0`. 

Since we do not have specific values for `n`, `k`, or `b`, we can state that `k` must be adjusted to ensure that `b` remains non-zero. 

State: **`a` is `n % k`, `b` is `k % (n % k) and k is not a multiple of n % k`**
