The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum required sum of the first `k` natural numbers. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, it computes a sequence of `k` integers that sum up to `n`, distributing any remaining amount (after accounting for the minimum sum) across the sequence. The function returns the modified sequence if there is a remainder greater than 0, otherwise it returns the unchanged sequence.
