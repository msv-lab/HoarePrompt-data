The code creates a list called `sequence` that contains `k` elements. Each element is calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. 

Given the previous calculations:
- `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, where `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- The value of `d` determines the multiples of `i + 1` that will be included in the `sequence`.

The resulting `sequence` will have values that are `d`, `2d`, `3d`, ..., up to `kd`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the calculated `sequence`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of values [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd].**
