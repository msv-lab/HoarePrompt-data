Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is `k - 1`. If `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.***
