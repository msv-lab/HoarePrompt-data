According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `i` initialized to `k - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2` (since it has been decremented once), which means it is currently pointing to the second-to-last element of the loop's range. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 1`, which means that `k` must be at least 2 (since `k` is at least 1, this condition is satisfied). 

Since the loop decrements `i` in each iteration, to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` back to `k - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted as the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence`) remain unchanged for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is `k - 1**
