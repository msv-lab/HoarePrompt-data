The `remainder` variable is decreased by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `sequence[i]`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 where `i` is `k - 1`.
