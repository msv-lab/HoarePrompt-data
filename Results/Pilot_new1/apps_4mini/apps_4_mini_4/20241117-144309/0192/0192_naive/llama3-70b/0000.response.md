To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
2. He wants to modify it to have a side length of `y`.
3. He can change one side of the triangle per second, and the triangle must remain non-degenerate (meaning the sides must be positive integers).
4. We need to determine the minimum number of seconds required to achieve this.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads two integers, `x` and `y`, and simply prints the absolute difference between them: `abs(x - y)`.

### Logical Evaluation:
1. The program calculates the difference between the starting side length `x` and the target side length `y`. However, this does not account for the necessary steps to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate during the transformation.
2. The triangle must maintain the property that all sides are positive integers. If `x` is reduced to `y`, it must do so in a manner that keeps the other sides valid throughout the process.

### Example Cases:
- For input `6 3`, the expected output is `4`, as demonstrated in the problem description. The program will output `3`, which is incorrect.
- For input `8 5`, the expected output is `3`, which the program would also output as `3`, which is correct.
- For input `22 4`, the expected output is `6`, while the program would output `18`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the necessary operations required to maintain the triangle's properties during the transition from `x` to `y`. It simply calculates the absolute difference, which does not reflect the actual process of modifying the triangle sides while avoiding degeneracy.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential input cases.

Correctness: **False**.
