Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length `x` and the ending side length `y`, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`.

For example, consider the input `6 3`. The program would output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of transformations is:
1. (6, 6, 6) → (6, 6, 3) → (6, 4, 3) → (3, 4, 3) → (3, 3, 3)
This takes a total of 4 seconds, not 3.

Another example is `8 5`. The program would output `3`, which is correct, but it does not handle all cases as shown above.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
