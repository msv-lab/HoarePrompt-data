The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the specific return values or cases based on the output description. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value is not defined.**
