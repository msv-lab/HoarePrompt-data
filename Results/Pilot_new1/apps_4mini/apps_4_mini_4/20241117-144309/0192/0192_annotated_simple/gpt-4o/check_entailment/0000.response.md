To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem and the code.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to transform an equilateral triangle with side length `x` into one with side length `y` while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate. The key points to consider are:
- The triangle remains equilateral throughout the process.
- The transformation involves reducing the side lengths from `x` to `y`.
- The output should be the minimum number of seconds (or operations) required to achieve this transformation.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from input.
2. **Calculation**: The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` is used to calculate the number of operations needed to reduce the triangle from side length `x` to `y`.

### Understanding the Calculation:
- The expression `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of full operations needed to reduce the side length by 2 for each operation (since we can change one side at a time).
- The expression `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is an additional operation needed if the difference is odd.

### Edge Cases:
Let's check if the code handles all potential edge cases correctly:
1. **Minimum Input Values**: For `x = 4` and `y = 3`, the output should be `1`. The calculation yields `(4 - 3) // 2 + (4 - 3) % 2 = 0 + 1 = 1`. This is correct.
2. **Even Difference**: For `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the output should be `4`. The calculation yields `(6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 1 + 0 = 3`, which is incorrect as per the problem description. The correct number of steps should be `4` as illustrated in the example.
3. **General Case**: For `x = 8` and `y = 5`, the output should be `3`. The calculation gives `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y` for the given examples and edge cases. The provided logic fails to account for the correct number of operations needed when reducing the triangle's sides in a non-degenerate manner.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails in cases where the difference between `x` and `y` is odd, as it does not account for the necessary additional operation to ensure all sides remain non-degenerate. For instance, the case `(6, 3)` should yield `4`, but the program incorrectly calculates it as `3`.
