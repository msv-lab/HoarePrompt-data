Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. It does not return any value. There are no checks for the constraints mentioned in the annotations (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000), so it can accept any integers as input.**
