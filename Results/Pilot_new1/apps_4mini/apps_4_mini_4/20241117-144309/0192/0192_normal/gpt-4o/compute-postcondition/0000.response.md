The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input provided, which is split into two integers. The condition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning that `y` must be less than `x` and both must be within the specified range. The previous values of `x` and `y` are unknown since they are being set based on user input. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, assigned from input values.**
