The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of integers that can be evenly distributed between `x` and `y`, plus one if there is a remainder. Given that `y` is an integer such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we can derive the output based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Let `d = x - y`. Then:
- `d` is at least `1` (since `y < x`), and at most `99,997` (since `x` can be `100,000` and `y` can be `3`).
- The expression simplifies to `d // 2 + d % 2`, which is equivalent to `(d + 1) // 2`.

The output state reflects that the function prints the result of this calculation, and does not alter the values of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the function prints the value of (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2**
