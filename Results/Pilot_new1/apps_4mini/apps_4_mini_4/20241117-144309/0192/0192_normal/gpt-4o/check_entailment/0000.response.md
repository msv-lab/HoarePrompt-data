To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to determine the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to modify an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to a triangle of side length `y`, ensuring that at no point does the triangle become degenerate (i.e., it must always have positive area).

### Analyzing the Code:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

1. The code reads two integers `x` and `y`.
2. It calculates the difference `x - y`, which represents how much the triangle's side length needs to be reduced.
3. The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`.

### Edge Cases:
- The constraints ensure `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning `x` is always greater than `y` and both are at least 3. Therefore, we do not need to handle cases where `x <= y` or where `x` or `y` are less than 3.
- The code needs to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate. Since we are reducing the sides, we need to ensure that at no point do we set any side to zero or negative.

### Output Hints:
The output hints state:
- The function computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`.
- The hints suggest that the output is valid as per the constraints and calculations made by the code.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly computes the minimum number of seconds required to reduce the side length from `x` to `y` as per the problem description. Since the constraints guarantee that `x` is always greater than `y` and both are at least 3, the triangle will remain non-degenerate throughout the process. 

Given that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases and that the output hints agree with the logic of the code, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code accurately calculates the required number of modifications needed to achieve the desired triangle side length while adhering to the constraints provided.
