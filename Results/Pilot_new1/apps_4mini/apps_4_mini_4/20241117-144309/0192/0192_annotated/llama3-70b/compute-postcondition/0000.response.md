The variables `x` and `y` are assigned values from the input, which are converted to integers. The constraints state that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, but the specific values of `x` and `y` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state reflects that `x` and `y` have been updated to the input integers while still adhering to the constraints.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer such that 3 < `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; `y` is an input integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
