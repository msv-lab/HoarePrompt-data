The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not provide specific output details in the provided information. Therefore, based on the given constraints, we can summarize the functionality of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.**
