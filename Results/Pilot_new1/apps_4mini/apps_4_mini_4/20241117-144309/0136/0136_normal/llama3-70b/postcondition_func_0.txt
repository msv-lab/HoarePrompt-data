The function accepts two non-negative integer inputs as strings, removes any leading zeroes, and compares their values. It prints '=' if the integers are equal, '<' if the first integer is less than the second, and '>' if the first integer is greater than the second. Note that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the inputs are empty strings or invalid non-integer values, which may lead to unexpected behavior.
