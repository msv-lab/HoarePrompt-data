The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings that may contain leading zeroes, and each string has a length of at most 10^6 characters. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on their values. However, the specific output or behavior of the function based on these inputs has not been provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, and processes these inputs.**
