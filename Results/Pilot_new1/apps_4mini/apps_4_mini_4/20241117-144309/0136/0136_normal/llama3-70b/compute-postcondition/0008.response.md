The code executes a print statement which outputs the character '>'. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the print function does not modify variables. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is an input string with leading zeroes removed; the function prints '>'.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeroes removed; `b` is an input string with leading zeroes removed; the function prints '>'**
