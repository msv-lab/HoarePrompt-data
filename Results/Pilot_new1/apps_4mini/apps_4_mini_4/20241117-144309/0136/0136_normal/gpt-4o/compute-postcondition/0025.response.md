Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers without leading zeros. If the length of `a` is less than that of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than that of `b`, the output is '>'. If both have the same length, the program compares their values: if `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'; and if they are equal, it prints '='. The program correctly handles cases where `a` or `b` may be empty by treating empty `a` as '0' and empty `b` as '0', ensuring all edge cases are covered in the comparisons.***
