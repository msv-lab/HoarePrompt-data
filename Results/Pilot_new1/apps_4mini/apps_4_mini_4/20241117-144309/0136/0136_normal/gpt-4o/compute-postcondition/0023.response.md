Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers without leading zeros, with equal lengths. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `b` was originally empty, it is now '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is also '0'. Thus, all cases are covered, including the comparison of equal-length strings representing numbers and handling empty strings appropriately.***
