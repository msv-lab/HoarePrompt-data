The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which means it will hold a list of strings that are separated by whitespace from the input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. The exact contents of `data` depend on the input provided at runtime, which can vary.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings; `data` is a list of strings obtained from input**
