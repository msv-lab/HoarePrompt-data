The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `data[1]` can be any string, and leading zeros will be stripped. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `b` after leading zeros are removed.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros; `data` is a list of strings obtained from input**
