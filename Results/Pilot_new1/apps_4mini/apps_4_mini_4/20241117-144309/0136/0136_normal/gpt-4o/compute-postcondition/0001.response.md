The code assigns `a` the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state indicates that `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, and `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. Since `data[0]` is a string, the leading zeros will be stripped from it. The value of `b` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeros; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained from input**
