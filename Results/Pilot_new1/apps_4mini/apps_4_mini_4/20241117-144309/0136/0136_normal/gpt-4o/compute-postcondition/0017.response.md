Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representation of a number without leading zeros, `b` is a string representation of a number without leading zeros, the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `b` was originally empty, it is now '0'; otherwise, `b` retains its original value from `data[1]`. If `a` was originally empty, it is now '0'.***
