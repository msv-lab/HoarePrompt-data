The value of `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes from the input string will be removed. Since `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` will be the input string provided by the user without any leading zeroes. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, and `b` is the input string without leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes**
