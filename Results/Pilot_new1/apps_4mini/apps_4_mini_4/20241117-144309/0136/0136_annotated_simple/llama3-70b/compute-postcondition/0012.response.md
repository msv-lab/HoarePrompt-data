Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integer inputs as strings, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the two strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if it is greater. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are empty or contain only zeroes, which may lead to unexpected behavior. **
