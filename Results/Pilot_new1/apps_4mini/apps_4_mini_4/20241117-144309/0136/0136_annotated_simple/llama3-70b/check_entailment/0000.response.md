To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze its logic in relation to the problem description.

The program aims to compare two very large integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes. The process involves:

1. Reading two strings `a` and `b` from input.
2. Removing any leading zeroes from both strings using `lstrip('0')`.
3. Comparing the resulting strings:
   - If they are equal, it prints `=`.
   - If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, it prints `<`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `>`.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases:

1. **Leading Zeroes**: The program correctly removes leading zeroes, so inputs like `00012345` will be treated as `12345`, which is correct.
2. **Equal Numbers**: The program handles equality correctly, printing `=` when both numbers are equal after leading zero removal.
3. **Different Lengths**: The program relies on lexicographical comparison, which is valid because:
   - After leading zero removal, if one string is longer than the other, it represents a larger number.
   - If two strings are of the same length, lexicographical comparison will correctly determine which is greater.

### Potential Problem:
The program does not handle the case when both inputs are `0`, which would be represented as `0` and `0` after leading zero removal. In this case, it would print `=`, which is correct. However, if both inputs are empty after stripping (e.g., if both inputs were just leading zeroes), it will cause an issue because `lstrip('0')` would return an empty string. In Python, comparing two empty strings would also yield equality, which is not intended behavior for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program does not explicitly handle the edge case of two inputs being purely leading zeroes (e.g., `0000` and `0000`), where it would strip them down to empty strings. This could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect comparisons.

Thus, based on the analysis, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
