The variable `data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which means it will take input from the user, split the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and store that list in `data`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `data` and the unchanged variables `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, potentially containing leading zeroes, and each string has a length of at most 10^6 characters; `data` is a list of strings obtained from user input split by whitespace.**
