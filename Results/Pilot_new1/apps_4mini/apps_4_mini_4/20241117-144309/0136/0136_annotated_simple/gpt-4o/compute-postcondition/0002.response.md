The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeroes using the `lstrip('0')` method. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `a` and the new value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is `data[1]` without leading zeroes**
