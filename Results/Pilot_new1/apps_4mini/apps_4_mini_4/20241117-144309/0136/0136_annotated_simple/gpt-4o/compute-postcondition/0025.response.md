Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty; `b` is either an unchanged string representing a number without leading zeroes or '0' if it was empty. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is determined by comparing the values of `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; and if `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. All comparisons are valid due to the precondition that ensures both strings are properly formatted.***
