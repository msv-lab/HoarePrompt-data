The code `print('>')` outputs the string `>` to the console. It does not alter the values of the variables `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged regarding the variables, but indicates that the output of the print statement has occurred. 

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes, or '0' if it was empty; `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeroes; the output is '>'**
