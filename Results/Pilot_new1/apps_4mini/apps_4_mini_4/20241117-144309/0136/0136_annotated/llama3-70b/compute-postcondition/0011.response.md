The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string has a length of at most 10^6 characters. The function returns the sum of the two numbers represented by the strings `a` and `b`, also as a string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and return their sum as a string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`, and returns their sum as a string.**
