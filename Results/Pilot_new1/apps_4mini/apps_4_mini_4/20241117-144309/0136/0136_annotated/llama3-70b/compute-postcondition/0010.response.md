Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, and `b` is an input string without leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is printed as '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is printed as '<'. Otherwise, the output is printed as '>', indicating that `a` is greater than `b`.***
