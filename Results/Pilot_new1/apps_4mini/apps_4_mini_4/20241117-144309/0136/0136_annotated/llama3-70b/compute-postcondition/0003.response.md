The code prints the string `'='`. Since `a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, and `b` is an input string without leading zeroes, and they are equal, the output state reflects that no variables have changed; only the string `'='` is printed. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is an input string without leading zeroes, and the output is printed as `'='`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer string without leading zeroes, `b` is an input string without leading zeroes, and the output is printed as `'='`**
