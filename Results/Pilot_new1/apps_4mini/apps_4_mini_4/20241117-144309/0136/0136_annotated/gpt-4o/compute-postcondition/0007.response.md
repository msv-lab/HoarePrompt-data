The value of `b` is assigned the string `'0'`. The initial state indicates that `a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros, and if `a` is empty, it is set to `'0'`, but since `a` is not empty, it remains unchanged. The state of `a` does not change, and `b` is now `'0'`. 

Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` without leading zeros; `b` is '0'**
