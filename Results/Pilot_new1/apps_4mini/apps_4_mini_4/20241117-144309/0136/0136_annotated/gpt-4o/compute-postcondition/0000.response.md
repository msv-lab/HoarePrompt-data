The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list of strings, which will be assigned to the variable `data`. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them. The output state reflects that `data` now holds the split input values. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings; `data` is a list of strings obtained from input.**
