Functionality: ** The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from user input, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is smaller, '>' if it is larger, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it is treated as '0'. The function does not accept parameters directly and relies on user input for its operation. **
