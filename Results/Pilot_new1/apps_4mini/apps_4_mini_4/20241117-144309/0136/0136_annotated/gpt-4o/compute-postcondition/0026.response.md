The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes and have a length of up to \(10^6\) digits. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the return value without additional context. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings.**
