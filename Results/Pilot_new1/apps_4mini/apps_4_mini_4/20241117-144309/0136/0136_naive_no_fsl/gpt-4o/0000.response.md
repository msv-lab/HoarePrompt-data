Correctness: **False**

The program has a flaw in how it handles leading zeroes. Specifically, while it correctly strips leading zeroes from the input, it fails to account for the case where both numbers are made up entirely of zeroes. For example, if the input is:

```
000000
000000
```

The program will strip the leading zeroes and set both `a` and `b` to an empty string. In this case, the condition `if not a:` will set `a` to '0', and similarly for `b`. However, the subsequent comparisons will not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are equal after stripping, leading to potentially incorrect behavior.

Additionally, the program does not handle the edge case where both numbers are zero correctly, as it will output `=` without explicitly checking for the case of both being '0'. 

Thus, the program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
