The `b.sort(reverse=True)` method sorts the list `b` in place in descending order. The initial values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation, and the list `s` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state reflects the new sorted order of the list `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
