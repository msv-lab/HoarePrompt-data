The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers between 1 and 30; `r`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000; `s`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000; and `b`, which is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 1000. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or the conditions under which it returns different outputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, s, and b, where n and m are integers between 1 and 30, r is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of n integers between 1 and 1000, and b is a list of m integers between 1 and 1000. The specific return value is not provided.**
