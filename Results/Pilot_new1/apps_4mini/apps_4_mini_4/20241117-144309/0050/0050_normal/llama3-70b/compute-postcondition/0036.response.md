Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares` multiplied by `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
