According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than `i`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one iteration left. However, we need to adjust `i` to reflect the next iteration.

Since the loop is controlled by `i`, which starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, we need to set `i` to its next value, which is 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is still greater than `i` (which will be 1).

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`. The value of `i` should be incremented to reflect the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order, `i` is 1**
