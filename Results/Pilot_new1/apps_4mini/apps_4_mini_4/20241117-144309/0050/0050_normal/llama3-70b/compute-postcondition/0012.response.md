Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `b` is sorted in descending order, and `shares` is updated based on the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, and `shares` reflects the total shares calculated from `r`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop or if statement is exited without modifying `shares`, and `r` remains unchanged.***
