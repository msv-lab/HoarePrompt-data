According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 

Since `i` is currently 0, it can be adjusted to 1 for the next iteration. The value of `m` remains unchanged, as it is already greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
