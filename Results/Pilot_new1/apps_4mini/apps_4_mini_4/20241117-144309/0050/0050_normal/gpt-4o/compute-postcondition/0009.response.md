The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`, where `r` is the total amount of money available and `min_buy_price` is the minimum price from the list `s`. This operation calculates the remainder when `r` is divided by `min_buy_price`. The values of `n`, `m`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, and `max_shares` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the values of these variables and the newly calculated `remaining_bourles`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`; `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`; `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`.**
