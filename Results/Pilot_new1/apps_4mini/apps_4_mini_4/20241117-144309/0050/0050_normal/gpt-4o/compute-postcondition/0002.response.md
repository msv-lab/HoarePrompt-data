The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the results of `input().split()`, which means `b` will be a list of integers based on the input provided. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from input**
