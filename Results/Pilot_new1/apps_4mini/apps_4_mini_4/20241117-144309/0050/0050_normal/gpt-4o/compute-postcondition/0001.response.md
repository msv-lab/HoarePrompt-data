The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values to integers. The input consists of space-separated integers, which are converted to a list of integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not directly affected by this operation, but `s` will now hold a list of integers based on the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new variable `s` and its contents derived from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input**
