The `s.sort()` method sorts the list `s` in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged, as well as the list `b`, which is derived from input. The only variable affected is `s`, which is now sorted. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted state of `s`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned integer values from input; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of m integers derived from input.**
