According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect this.

State: **`shares` is greater than or equal to 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `s` is a non-empty list with no zero elements, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
