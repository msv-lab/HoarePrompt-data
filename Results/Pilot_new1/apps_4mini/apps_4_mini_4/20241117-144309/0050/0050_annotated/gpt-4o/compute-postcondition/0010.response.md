To determine the output state, we first need to analyze the given initial state and the provided code snippet.

1. The initial state defines several variables:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 30\).
   - `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 1000\).
   - `s` is a list of integers from input.
   - `b` is a list of integers from input.
   - `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`.
   - `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, with `max_sell_price` being greater than `min_buy_price`.
   - `max_shares` is calculated as \( \text{max\_shares} = r // \text{min\_buy\_price} \).
   - `remaining_bourles` is calculated as \( \text{remaining\_bourles} = r \% \text{min\_buy\_price} \).

2. The code snippet calculates the total bourles:
   - `total_bourles` is calculated as \( \text{total\_bourles} = \text{max\_shares} \times \text{max\_sell\_price} + \text{remaining\_bourles} \).

3. The output state will reflect the values of the variables after the execution of the code, specifically focusing on `total_bourles`.

Given that `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, and `remaining_bourles` are derived from the lists `s` and `b` and the integer `r`, we can summarize the final output state:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, `b` is a list of integers from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is calculated as `r % min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.**
