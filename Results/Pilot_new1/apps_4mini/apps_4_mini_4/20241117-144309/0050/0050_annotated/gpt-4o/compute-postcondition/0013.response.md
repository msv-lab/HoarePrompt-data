The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as shown in the provided definition. However, it operates with the following constraints and relationships:

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 30\).
- `r` is an integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 1000\).
- `s` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(s_i\) is such that \(1 \leq s_i \leq 1000\).
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer \(b_i\) is such that \(1 \leq b_i \leq 1000\).

The function's output is not described in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot specify return values or conditions. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on predefined constraints related to integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and lists `s` and `b`. The output of the function is not specified.**
