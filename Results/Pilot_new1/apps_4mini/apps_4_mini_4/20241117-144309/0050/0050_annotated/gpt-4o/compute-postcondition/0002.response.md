The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation, but `b` will contain integers derived from the input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new variable `b` holding the list of integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `r` <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers from input, and `b` is a list of integers from input.**
