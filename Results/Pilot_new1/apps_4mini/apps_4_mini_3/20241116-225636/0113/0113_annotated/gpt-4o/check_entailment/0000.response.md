To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations closely.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to find the minimum positive integer `x` such that:
1. `x` ends with `k` or more zeros in base 10.
2. `x` is divisible by `n`.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code is:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
```

#### Breakdown of the Code:
1. **Multiplier Calculation**: `multiplier = 10 ** k`
   - This correctly calculates the minimum factor required to ensure `x` ends with `k` zeros.
   
2. **Calculation of `x`**:
   - `x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`
   - This line attempts to compute `x` by scaling `n` with the appropriate factor such that `x` is divisible by `n` and ends with `k` zeros.

### Code Annotations:
The annotations state that the function:
- Returns the value of `x` calculated as `n * (10 // math.gcd(n, 10))`.
- The annotations imply that the function should work for the cases described in the problem statement.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When `k = 0`**:
   - The output should simply be `n`, since no zeros are required. The code correctly handles this by calculating `multiplier` as `1` (i.e., `10 ** 0`), and thus `x` will be `n`.

2. **When `k > 0`**:
   - **Example**: For `n = 375` and `k = 4`, the expected output is `30000`. Here, `multiplier` becomes `10000`, and the calculation should yield `375 * (10000 // gcd(375, 10000))`. This indeed results in `30000`.
   - **Example**: For `n = 123456789` and `k = 8`, the expected output is `12345678900000000`. The code will compute `multiplier` as `100000000` and calculate `x` accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
The code uses `math.gcd(n, multiplier)` but the annotation mentions using `math.gcd(n, 10)` for its explanation. This could lead to confusion regarding how the function actually behaves with different values of `k`. 

However, the critical point is that the calculation of `x` must ensure that it meets the requirement of being divisible by `n` while also ensuring that it ends with `k` zeros. The formula used in the code does achieve this, as it effectively finds the least common multiple of `n` and `multiplier`.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, the annotations, and the examples given in the problem statement, it appears that the function correctly implements the logic required to fulfill the problem's requirements for all specified cases.

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly computes the k-rounding of `n` for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
