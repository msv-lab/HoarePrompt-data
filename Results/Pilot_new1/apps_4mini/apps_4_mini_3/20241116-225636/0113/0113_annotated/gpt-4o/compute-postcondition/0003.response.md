The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, it returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as n * (10 // math.gcd(n, 10)). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the value of `x` based on the calculation involving `n` and the greatest common divisor of `n` and 10. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a non-negative integer k, and returns the value of x calculated as n * (10 // math.gcd(n, 10)).**
