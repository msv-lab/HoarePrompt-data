Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculates a multiplier as 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `x` computed as `n` multiplied by the quotient of `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. The actual calculation uses `10` instead of `10 ** k` in the greatest common divisor computation, which may not reflect the intended logic if `k` is greater than `1`. Additionally, if `n` is `0`, the function will return `0` since any number multiplied by `0` results in `0`.**
