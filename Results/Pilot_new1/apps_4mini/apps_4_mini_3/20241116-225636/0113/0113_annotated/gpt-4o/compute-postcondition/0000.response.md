The code assigns the value of `10` raised to the power of `k` to the variable `multiplier`. Since `k` is a non-negative integer in the range from `0` to `8`, the value of `multiplier` will be `1`, `10`, `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, `1000000`, `10000000`, or `100000000`. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is 10 ** k**
