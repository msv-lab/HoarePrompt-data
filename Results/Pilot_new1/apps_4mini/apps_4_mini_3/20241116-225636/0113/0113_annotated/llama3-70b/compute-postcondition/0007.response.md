According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must not be divisible by `x`, meaning `n % x` must not equal 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input positive integer incremented by 1, and now `n` is incremented by 1 again, which means `n` is currently 2 more than its original value. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state such that `n % x` is not equal to 0. If `n` is currently 2 more than its original value, we need to ensure that this value still satisfies the condition of not being divisible by `x`. 

Thus, we need to state that `n` must be such that `n` is still not divisible by `x` after the increment. Therefore, we can state that `n` must be greater than or equal to `x + 1` (to ensure it is not a multiple of `x`).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`**
