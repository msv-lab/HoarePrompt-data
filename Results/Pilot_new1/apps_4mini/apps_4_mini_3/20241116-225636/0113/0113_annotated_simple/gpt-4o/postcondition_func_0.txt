The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns the value of `x`, which is calculated as `n` multiplied by `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`, where `multiplier` is `10` raised to the power of `k`. The function does not handle cases where `n` is zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected results or errors in certain contexts.
