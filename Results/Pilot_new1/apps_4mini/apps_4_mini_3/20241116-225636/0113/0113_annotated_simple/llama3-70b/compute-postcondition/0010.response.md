The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates on two variables: `n` and `k`. 

`n` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \(0 \leq k \leq 8\). 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return values. However, it is understood that the function will return a result based on the values of `n` and `k` within their respective constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer between 1 and 10^9) and k (a non-negative integer between 0 and 8), and returns a result based on these parameters.**
