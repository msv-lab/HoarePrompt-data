The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and since `n` is an input positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^9\), the new value of `n` will be between 2 and \(10^9 + 1\). The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ \(10^9 + 1\), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, and `x` is equal to 10.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 + 1, `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, and `x` is equal to 10**
