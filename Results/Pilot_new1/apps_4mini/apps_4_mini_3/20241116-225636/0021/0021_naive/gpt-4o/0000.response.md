To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code.

The problem requires us to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in an array of distinct integers from 1 to n by performing exactly one swap. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between the positions of these two elements.

Here's the relevant part of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
min_pos = a.index(1)
max_pos = a.index(n)
dist1 = abs(0 - max_pos)  # distance if 1 is swapped to the front
dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)  # distance if 1 is swapped to the back
dist3 = abs(0 - min_pos)  # distance if n is swapped to the front
dist4 = abs(n - 1 - min_pos)  # distance if n is swapped to the back
max_distance = max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)
print(max_distance)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Identifying Positions**: The program correctly identifies the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
2. **Calculating Distances**: It calculates the distances based on moving either the minimum or maximum element to the ends of the list.
3. **Maximizing Distance**: The program then finds the maximum of these calculated distances.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not consider the effect of a swap on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements correctly. Specifically, it calculates distances based on their original positions without actually considering the swap that would occur.
- For instance, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (where 1 is at index 0 and 5 is at index 4), the maximum distance is already 4. If we swap 1 with 5, they will be at indices 4 and 0 respectively, which gives a distance of 4. The program does not account for the maximum distance after performing the swap.

### Counter Example:
Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output should be `4` (after swapping 1 and 5), but the program does not calculate this correctly because it does not simulate the swap.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for the actual positions after a swap, which is crucial to determining the maximum distance. Thus, it does not meet the problem requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
