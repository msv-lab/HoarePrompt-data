The variable `a` is assigned the value of a list created from the input, where `input().split()` takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each substring into an integer. The previous values of `n` and `a` are not directly affected by this assignment, but `a` will now hold a list of `n` distinct integers as specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers derived from the input**
