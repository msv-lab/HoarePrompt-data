The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are known based on the initial state. 

Thus, `dist4` will be calculated as follows:
- If `n` is an input integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`, then `dist4` will be a non-negative integer representing the absolute distance from `min_pos` to `n - 1`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state will include the new value of `dist4` while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is min_pos; `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos**.
