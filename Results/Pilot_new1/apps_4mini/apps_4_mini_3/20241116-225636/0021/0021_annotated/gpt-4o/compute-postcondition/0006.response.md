The variable `dist3` is assigned the value `abs(0 - min_pos)`, which calculates the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`. The value of `min_pos` is not specified, but it is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`. Therefore, `dist3` will be equal to `min_pos`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in `a`; `dist1` is max_pos; `dist2` is abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is min_pos**
