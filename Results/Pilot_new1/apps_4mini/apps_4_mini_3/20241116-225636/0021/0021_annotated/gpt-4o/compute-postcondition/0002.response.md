The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the value `1` in the list `a`. The initial state indicates that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 100, we can assume that the list `a` contains distinct integers including `1`. The value of `min_pos` will be the position of `1` in the list `a`, which is determined by the input.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers including 1; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`**
