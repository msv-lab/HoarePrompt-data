The function accepts an integer `n` (between 2 and 100 inclusive) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers 1 and `n` in the list, adjusting for the distance to the ends of the list. It then prints the result of this maximum distance calculation. The function does not handle cases where the input does not conform to the expected format, such as if `1` or `n` is not present in the list, which could lead to a ValueError.
