The code assigns the value of `posn` to the index of `n` in the list `a`. Given that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, it is possible that `n` may or may not be present in `a`. The state of `pos1` is not affected by this operation. 

If `n` is found in `a`, `posn` will hold the index of `n`. If `n` is not found, this will raise a `ValueError`. Since we do not have specific values for `a` or `n`, we can only describe the possible outcomes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in `a` or a ValueError if `n` is not in `a`.**
