The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers, and `map(int, ...)` converts each of those string representations into integers. The initial state indicates that `a` will now hold a list of integers based on the input provided. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive) and `a` consists of `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n`, the output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers derived from input**
