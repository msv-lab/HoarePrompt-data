The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is specified to be an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), the value of `n` will be set to that input integer. The list `a` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)**
