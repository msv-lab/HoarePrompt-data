The code retrieves the index of the value `1` from the list `a`. Given that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `n` is between 2 and 100 (inclusive), it is assumed that `1` is present in the list. The variable `pos1` will be assigned the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `pos1` is the index of `1` in `a**
