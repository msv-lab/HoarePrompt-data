To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider potential edge cases.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the maximum distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of integers from 1 to n after performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis:
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

1. The program reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers.
2. It finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list.
3. It calculates `max_dist` and `min_dist` based on the absolute difference between the positions of 1 and n.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Input where 1 or n is not present:** The program uses `a.index(1)` and `a.index(n)`, which will raise a `ValueError` if either 1 or n is not in the list. However, according to the problem description, the input will always contain a permutation of integers from 1 to n, so this edge case is not applicable here.
- **Case when 1 and n are already at the ends:** For example, if the input is `2` and `1 2`, the distance is already maximized, but the program should still perform a swap. The output should be `1`, but the logic might not correctly account for the fact that the swap doesn't increase the distance. The program does not handle the scenario where the initial distance is already maximum and a swap would not change that.
- **General Case:** The formula used to calculate `max_dist` and `min_dist` could potentially yield incorrect results if the positions of 1 and n are adjacent or if they are already at the maximum possible distance.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input list does not contain the integers 1 or n, which is not a concern since the problem guarantees that the input is a valid permutation. However, it also mentions that the function calculates the maximum distance but does not explicitly state that it may not correctly handle already maximized distances.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly handle the scenario where the initial distance is already maximized or when elements are adjacent. Since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
