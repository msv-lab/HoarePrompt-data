The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take a space-separated input of integers, convert each to an integer, and store them in a list. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged, and it is still an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The exact values of the integers in `a` depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input.**
