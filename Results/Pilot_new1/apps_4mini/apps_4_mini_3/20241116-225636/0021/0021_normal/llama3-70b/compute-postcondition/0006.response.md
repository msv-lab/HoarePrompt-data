To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from the input
- `pos1` is the index of the element 1 in the list `a`
- `posn` is the index of the element `n` in the list `a`
- `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`
- `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`

The code snippet:
```
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code:
1. The function calculates `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.
2. Since `max_dist` and `min_dist` are already defined based on the positions of the elements in the list `a`, we can substitute their values into the expression.
3. The result of `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)` will be printed.

The output state will reflect the values of `max_dist`, `min_dist`, and the final result of the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of element 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of element `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the printed result is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
