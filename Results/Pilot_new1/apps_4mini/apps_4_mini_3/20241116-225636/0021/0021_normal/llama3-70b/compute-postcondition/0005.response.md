To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the provided code on the initial state.

1. The variable `min_dist` is assigned the value of `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.
2. The values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are given in the initial state. 
3. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` calculates the absolute difference between the indices of the elements `1` and `n` in the list `a`, then subtracts `1`.
4. The expression `n - 2` computes the value based on `n`.
5. `min()` then takes the smaller of these two calculated values.

Since we don't have specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`, we can only describe the output state in terms of the computations.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of the element 1 in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of the element `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
