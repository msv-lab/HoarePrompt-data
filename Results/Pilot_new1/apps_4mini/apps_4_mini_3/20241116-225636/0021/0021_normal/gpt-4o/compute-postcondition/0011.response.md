Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (expected to be between 2 and 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers `1` and `n` to either end of the list (index 0 or index n-1) and prints this maximum distance. It does not handle cases where `1` or `n` are not present in the list, which would raise a `ValueError`. **
