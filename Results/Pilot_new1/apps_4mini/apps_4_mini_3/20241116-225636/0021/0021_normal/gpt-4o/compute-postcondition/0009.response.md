To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The initial state mentions that:
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`.
   - `max_pos` is the index of n in `a`.
   - `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.
   - `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`.
   - `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.
   - `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`.

2. The line `print(max_distance)` outputs the value of `max_distance`.

Since the values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`, and consequently `max_distance` depend on the specific values of `n`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos`, we will summarize the output state based on the calculations made with these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is equal to max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4); the value of `max_distance` is printed.**
