The code assigns `max_pos` the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of integers based on user input. However, since the specific contents of `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_pos`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in `a`, but we cannot specify the exact value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a**.
