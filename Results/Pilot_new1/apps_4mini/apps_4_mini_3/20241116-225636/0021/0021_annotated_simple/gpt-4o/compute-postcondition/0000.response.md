The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` must be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100**
