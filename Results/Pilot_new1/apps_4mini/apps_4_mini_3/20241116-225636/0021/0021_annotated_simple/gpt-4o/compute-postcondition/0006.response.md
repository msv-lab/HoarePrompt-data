To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The code assigns a value to `dist3`, which is calculated as `abs(0 - min_pos)`. However, we do not have information about the value of `min_pos` from the initial state. Therefore, we cannot calculate a specific value for `dist3`.

2. The initial state specifies:
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a` is a list of integers based on user input.
   - `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.
   - `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`.
   - `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.

3. Since we do not have information about `min_pos`, we cannot determine the exact value of `dist3`. However, we can note that `dist3` is dependent on `min_pos`.

Given this analysis, the output state reflects the known variables and acknowledges the calculation of `dist3` without a specific value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers based on user input; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `max_pos`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`**.
