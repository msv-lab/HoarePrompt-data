Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n). It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list, adjusting for the boundaries of the list. It prints the maximum distance between the two positions or the distance from either end of the list, ensuring the output reflects the farthest distance possible based on the given inputs. **
