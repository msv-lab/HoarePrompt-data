To evaluate the code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the line of code on the variables involved. 

1. The variable `pos1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. 
2. The variable `posn` is also not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
3. The variable `n` is defined as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
4. The expression `abs(pos1 - posn)` calculates the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`.
5. The code then subtracts 1 from that absolute difference and compares it with `n - 2`.
6. The `max` function will return the maximum of the two computed values.

Since we do not have specific values for `pos1` and `posn`, we cannot compute an exact value for `max_dist`. Therefore, the output state will indicate the relationship between the variables without providing specific values for `max_dist`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_dist` is the maximum of (abs(pos1 - posn) - 1) and (`n` - 2)**
