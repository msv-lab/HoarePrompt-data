Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `min_time` is updated to `time` if `time` is less than the previous `min_time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is 1 in this case. If `time` is not less than `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. The variable `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d, where `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses` and `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`.***
