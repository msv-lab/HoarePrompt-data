The values of `n` and `t` are assigned through the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input and splits it into two parts, converting them into integers. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, the output state will reflect that `n` and `t` are now defined as integers based on the input provided. The previous values of `n` and `t` are replaced by the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000**
