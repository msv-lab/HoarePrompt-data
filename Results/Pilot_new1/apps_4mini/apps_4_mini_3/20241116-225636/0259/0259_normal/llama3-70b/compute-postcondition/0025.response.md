Postcondition: ***`buses` contains at least 2 tuples. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to `i + 1` (which is 2). If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, the values of `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged. In either case, `i` is still 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`.***
