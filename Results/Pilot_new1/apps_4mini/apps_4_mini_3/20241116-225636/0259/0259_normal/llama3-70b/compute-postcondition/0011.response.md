According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, and the iteration variable `_` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, which means the loop has executed for `_` values 0, 1, and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be incremented to 3, and it must still be less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 < n \leq 100 \). Since `_` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `_` should be 3.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is updated to include the tuple (s, d), `_` is 3, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
