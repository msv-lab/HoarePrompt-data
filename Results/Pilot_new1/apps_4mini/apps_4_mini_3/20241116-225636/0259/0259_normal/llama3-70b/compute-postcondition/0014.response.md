The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `-1`. The values of the other variables, `buses` and `min_time`, are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `ans` while keeping the initial states of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`buses` contains `n` tuples of integers; `min_time` is set to positive infinity; `ans` is -1**
