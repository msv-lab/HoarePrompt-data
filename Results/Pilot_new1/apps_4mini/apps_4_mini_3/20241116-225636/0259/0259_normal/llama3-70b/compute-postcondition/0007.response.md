The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The initial state indicates that `buses` is already a list containing at least one tuple. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers. Therefore, after executing the code, `buses` will contain one additional tuple.

Since the initial state of `buses` is not explicitly known beyond being a list containing tuples, we can only confirm that an additional tuple has been added.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is updated to include the tuple (s, d), `_` is 1, `s` and `d` are input integers**
