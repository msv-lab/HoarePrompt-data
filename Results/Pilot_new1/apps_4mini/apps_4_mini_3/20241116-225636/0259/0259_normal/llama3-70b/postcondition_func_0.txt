The function accepts input values for `n` (the number of buses) and `t` (a time value), and then it reads `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` that represent the start time and duration of each bus. The function calculates the minimum waiting time for the next bus from the given time `t` and prints the 1-based index of the bus with the shortest waiting time. If there are no buses (i.e., `n` is 0), it prints -1 since there are no buses to consider. The function does not return any values but directly prints the result.
