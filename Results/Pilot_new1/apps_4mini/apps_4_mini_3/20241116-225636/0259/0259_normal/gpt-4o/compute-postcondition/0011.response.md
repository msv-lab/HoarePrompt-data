Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is a positive integer less than `t`, and `d_i` is a positive integer. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which will be a positive integer. This ensures that `wait_time` is always non-negative and reflects the time until the next bus arrives based on the schedule.***
