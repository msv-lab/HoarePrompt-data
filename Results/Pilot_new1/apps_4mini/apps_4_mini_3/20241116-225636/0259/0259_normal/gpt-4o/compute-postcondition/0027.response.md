According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its maximum value of `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which means `i` will equal `n`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` being equal to `n` indicates that the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `n` and ensure that `n` is still within its defined limits. 

No other states need to be adjusted as `bus_routes`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `wait_time` is calculated based on the bus schedule, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged, `i` is n**
