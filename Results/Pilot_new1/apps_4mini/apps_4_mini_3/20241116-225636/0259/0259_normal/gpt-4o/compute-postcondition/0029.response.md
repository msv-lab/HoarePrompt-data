The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are known from the initial state, where `s_i` is taken from `bus_routes[n]` and `t` is a positive integer. Therefore, `wait_time` will be the result of subtracting `t` from `s_i`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged, `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`.**
