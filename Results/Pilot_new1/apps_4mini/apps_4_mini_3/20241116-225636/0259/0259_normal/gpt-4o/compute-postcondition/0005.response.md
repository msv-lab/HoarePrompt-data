The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the result of the calculation will be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
