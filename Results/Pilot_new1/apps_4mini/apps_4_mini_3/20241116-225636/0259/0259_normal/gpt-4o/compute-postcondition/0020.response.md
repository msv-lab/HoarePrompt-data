The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables, as `wait_time` is a new variable being set. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1], and `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1], and `wait_time` is 0**.
