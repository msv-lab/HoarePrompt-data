Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is a positive integer less than `t`, `d_i` is a positive integer, and the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`***
