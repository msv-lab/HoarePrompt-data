Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.***
