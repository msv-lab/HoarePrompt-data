Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes based on the departure times `s_i` and intervals `d_i`, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route that provides this minimum wait time. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes at least once; if `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity and `chosen_route` remains -1. The variable `wait_time` is a non-negative integer calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i` and `d_i`, ensuring that all edge cases are handled, including when `s_i` is greater than, equal to, or less than `t`.**
