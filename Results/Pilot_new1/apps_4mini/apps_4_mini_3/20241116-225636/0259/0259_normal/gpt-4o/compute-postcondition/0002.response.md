According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop will execute at least once because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will begin at 0 (the first iteration of the loop). The other variables (`t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but they will be in their initial states when the loop starts.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
