The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. This means that `min_wait_time` is now set to a very large number, which can be used as a starting point for finding the minimum wait time in subsequent calculations. The values of `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**
