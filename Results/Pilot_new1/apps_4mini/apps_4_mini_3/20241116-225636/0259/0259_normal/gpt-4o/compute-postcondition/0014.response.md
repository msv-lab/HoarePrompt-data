The code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The initial state indicates that `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, but the exact value of `wait_time` is not specified. After execution, `min_wait_time` now holds the value of `wait_time`, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.**
