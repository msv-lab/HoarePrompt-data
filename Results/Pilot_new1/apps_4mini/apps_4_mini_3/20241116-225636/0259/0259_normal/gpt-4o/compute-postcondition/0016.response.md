Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], and `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1]. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 1. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, the values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. The value of `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions involving `s_i` and `d_i`, ensuring it is always a non-negative integer.***
