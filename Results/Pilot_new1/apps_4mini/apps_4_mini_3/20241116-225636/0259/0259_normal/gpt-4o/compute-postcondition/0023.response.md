Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], and `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1]. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `t` is exactly aligned with the schedule (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring it remains non-negative and reflects the next bus arrival based on the current time `t` and the bus schedule defined by `s_i` and `d_i`.***
