Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the bus schedule defined by `s_i` and `d_i`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, indicating the selection of the next bus route. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. This ensures that the minimum wait time and the corresponding chosen route are accurately reflected based on the computed wait time.***
