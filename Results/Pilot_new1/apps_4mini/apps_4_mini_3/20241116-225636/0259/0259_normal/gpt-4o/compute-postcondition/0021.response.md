To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided variables and the code snippet.

1. **Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100)
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000)
   - `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers
   - `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer
   - `chosen_route` is an integer
   - `i` is 1
   - `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0] (the departure time of the second bus route)
   - `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1] (the interval of the second bus route)

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code calculates `wait_time` using the formula:
     ```
     wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
     ```
   - Here, `t` and `s_i` are known positive integers, and `d_i` is the positive integer representing the bus interval.

3. **Impact**:
   - The variable `wait_time` is assigned a new value based on the calculation involving `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.
   - The other variables remain unchanged.

Since we do not have specific values for `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, we can't compute an explicit numerical result for `wait_time`, but we can describe its relationship with the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[1][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[1][1], and `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i**
