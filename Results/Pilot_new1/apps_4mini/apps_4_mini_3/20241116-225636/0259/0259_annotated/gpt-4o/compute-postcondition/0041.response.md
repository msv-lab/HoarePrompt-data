Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (the number of bus routes), an integer `t` (the time to catch a bus), and a list `bus_routes` containing tuples of integers representing the start time and interval of each bus route. It calculates the wait time for each bus route and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If no bus routes are available (i.e., `n` is 0), the function returns -1, indicating no route is available. Additionally, if all bus routes have start times less than `t` and no valid wait time can be calculated, the function will still return -1.**
