Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
