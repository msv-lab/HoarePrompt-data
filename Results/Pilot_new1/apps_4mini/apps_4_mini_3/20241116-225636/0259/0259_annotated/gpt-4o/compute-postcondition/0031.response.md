The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are previously assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `t` is not specified but is involved in the calculation. Since `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the contents of `bus_routes[2]`, but we do not have their specific values. Therefore, the output state reflects the calculation of `wait_time` without specific values for `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
