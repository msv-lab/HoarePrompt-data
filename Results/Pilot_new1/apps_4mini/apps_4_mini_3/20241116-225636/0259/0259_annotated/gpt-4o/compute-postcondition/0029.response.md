The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The values of `s_i` and `t` are not provided in the initial state, but `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[2]`. Since `n` is greater than 2, it implies that `bus_routes` has at least three elements. The value of `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[2]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
