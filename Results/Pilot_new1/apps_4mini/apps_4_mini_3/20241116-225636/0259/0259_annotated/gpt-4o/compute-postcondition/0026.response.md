Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions provided. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 2. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged.***
