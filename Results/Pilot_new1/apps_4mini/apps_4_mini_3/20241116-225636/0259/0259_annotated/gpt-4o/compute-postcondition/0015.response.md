The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, `chosen_route` will be 0 + 1, which equals 1. The values of `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time`, and `min_wait_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is a positive integer, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 1**.
