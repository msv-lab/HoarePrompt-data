Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, and `s_i` is less than `t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as a positive integer `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which represents the time until the next bus arrives.***
