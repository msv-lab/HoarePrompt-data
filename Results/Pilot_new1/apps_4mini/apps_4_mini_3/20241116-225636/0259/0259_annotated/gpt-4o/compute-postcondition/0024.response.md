The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions provided, but since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `wait_time`, we can only state that `min_wait_time` will take on the value of `wait_time`. The values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are values assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged.**
