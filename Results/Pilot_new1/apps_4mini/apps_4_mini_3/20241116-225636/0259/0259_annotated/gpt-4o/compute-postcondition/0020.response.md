The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value `0`, which means it is now reset to zero. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `wait_time` while indicating that the other variables are unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is 0, `min_wait_time` is unchanged, `chosen_route` is unchanged**
