The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This indicates that the minimum wait time is initially set to an infinitely large number, which is typically used to facilitate finding a minimum value in subsequent calculations. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**
