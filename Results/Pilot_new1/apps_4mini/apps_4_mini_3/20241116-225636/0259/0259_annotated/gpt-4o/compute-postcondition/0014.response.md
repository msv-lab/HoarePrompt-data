The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. Since `wait_time` is a positive integer and is less than `min_wait_time`, the state of `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`. The values of `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is a positive integer, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is a positive integer, and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time**
