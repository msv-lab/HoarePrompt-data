According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be an input integer between 1 and 100, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `buses` is currently an empty list, but it does not affect the execution of the loop itself since the loop does not depend on the contents of `buses` to run. The loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during the iterations. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range, and we can initialize the loop variable. However, since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable, we do not need to track its value after the loop. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
