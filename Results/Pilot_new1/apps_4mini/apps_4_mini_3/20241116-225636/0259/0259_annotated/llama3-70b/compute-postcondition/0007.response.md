The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are provided as input integers. The previous state of `buses` is not specified, but it initially contains one tuple. After executing the code, the list will contain two tuples: the original one and the newly appended one.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 0 and 99, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d).

Output State: **`n` is between 0 and 99, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `buses` contains the original tuple and the new tuple (s, d)**
