Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`.***
