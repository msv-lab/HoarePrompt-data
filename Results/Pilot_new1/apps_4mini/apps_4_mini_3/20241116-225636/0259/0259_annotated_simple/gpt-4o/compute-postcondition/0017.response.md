According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is between 1 and 100. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1 at the start of the next iteration. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` has increased by 1 and that `n` is still greater than `i` (which is now 1).

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity**
