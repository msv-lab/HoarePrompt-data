According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, which makes `i` equal to 2. Since `n` is greater than 1, it allows for `i` to be 2, meaning the loop can execute again.

No other states need to be adjusted as `t`, `bus_routes`, and `min_wait_time` are not affected by the loop iteration condition. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity**
