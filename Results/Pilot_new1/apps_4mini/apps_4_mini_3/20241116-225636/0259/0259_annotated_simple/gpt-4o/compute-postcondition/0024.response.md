To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and the initial state of the variables.

1. The code snippet assigns `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions involving `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. 
2. Since `wait_time` is not explicitly defined in the provided information, we can't determine its value directly. However, we know that it will be set based on the conditions outlined in the initial state.

Given that `min_wait_time` is initially positive infinity, after executing the line `min_wait_time = wait_time`, `min_wait_time` will take on the value of `wait_time`, whatever that may be based on the conditions specified.

Since the exact value of `wait_time` is not provided in the initial state, the output state will reflect that `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, but we cannot specify the exact numerical value.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`**.
