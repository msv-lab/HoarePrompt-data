The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is taken from the second tuple in the `bus_routes` list (i.e., `bus_routes[1]`), and `t` is a value between 1 and 100000. Therefore, `wait_time` will be calculated as `s_i - t`, where `s_i` will be some specific value from the tuple `bus_routes[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `s_i` is unknown but is part of the tuple, the output state can be expressed as: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `s_i` is from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `s_i` is from `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is `s_i - t`**
