Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity. If `s_i` (the starting time from `bus_routes[2]`) is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`, indicating the wait time until the next bus. If `s_i` is less than `t` and the bus arrives exactly at time `t` (i.e., `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, if the bus does not arrive exactly at time `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives after time `t`. This covers all cases for the wait time based on the relationship between `s_i`, `t`, and `d_i`.***
