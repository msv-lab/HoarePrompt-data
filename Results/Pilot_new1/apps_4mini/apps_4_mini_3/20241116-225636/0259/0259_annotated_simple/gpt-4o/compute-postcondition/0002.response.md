According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, the loop will execute at least once. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to 0 (the starting index of the loop). 

The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`) does not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but they may be relevant for the logic within the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to reflect that `i` is initialized to 0, and `n` is already set between 1 and 100.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i) where s_i and d_i are between 1 and 100000, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1**
