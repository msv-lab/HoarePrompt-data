Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` (which is 1). This ensures that `min_wait_time` reflects the smallest wait time encountered so far, and `chosen_route` indicates the corresponding route. If `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, these variables remain unchanged. This logic accounts for all scenarios of the bus schedule relative to the time `t`, ensuring that `wait_time` is always a non-negative value as described in the precondition.***
