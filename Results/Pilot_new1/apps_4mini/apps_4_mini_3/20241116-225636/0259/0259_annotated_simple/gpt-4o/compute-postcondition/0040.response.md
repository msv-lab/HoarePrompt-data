The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `s_i` and `d_i`, both of which are between 1 and 100000. After executing the function body, it returns the index of the chosen bus route that offers the minimum wait time. If no suitable route is found, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and a list of bus routes, and return the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if no suitable route exists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 100), t (an integer between 1 and 100000), and bus_routes (a list of tuples of two integers between 1 and 100000), and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time or -1 if no suitable route is found.**
