The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Given that `s_i` is less than `t` and the difference `(t - s_i)` is not divisible by `d_i`, we can deduce that `(t - s_i) % d_i` will yield a positive integer less than `d_i`. Therefore, `wait_time` will be a positive integer since `d_i` is greater than `(t - s_i) % d_i`.

Since `n`, `i`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are not directly affected by this calculation, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], `s_i` is less than `t`, and the difference (t - s_i) is not divisible by d_i; `wait_time` is a positive integer.**
