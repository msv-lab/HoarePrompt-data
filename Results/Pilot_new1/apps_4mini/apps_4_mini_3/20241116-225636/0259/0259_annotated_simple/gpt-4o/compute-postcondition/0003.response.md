The code assigns the values from the `i`-th tuple in the `bus_routes` list to the variables `s_i` and `d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the specific tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `s_i` and `d_i` based on the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1]**
