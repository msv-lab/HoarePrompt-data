The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The previous value of `min_wait_time` was positive infinity, and now it will be updated to the current value of `wait_time`, which is less than `min_wait_time`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.**
