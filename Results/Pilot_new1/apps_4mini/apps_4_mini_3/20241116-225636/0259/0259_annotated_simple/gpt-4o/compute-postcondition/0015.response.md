The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 0, the value of `chosen_route` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is now equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `s_i` is bus_routes[0][0], `d_i` is bus_routes[0][1], and `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time**
