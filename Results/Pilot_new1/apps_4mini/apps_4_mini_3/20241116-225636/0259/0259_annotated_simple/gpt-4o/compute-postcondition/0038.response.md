Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from the bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route that offers the minimum wait time (1-indexed). If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all bus routes have a wait time greater than or equal to positive infinity, `min_wait_time` will still be positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will be derived from the `bus_routes` list, which contains tuples of integers, and they will be accessed based on the loop index `i`.**
