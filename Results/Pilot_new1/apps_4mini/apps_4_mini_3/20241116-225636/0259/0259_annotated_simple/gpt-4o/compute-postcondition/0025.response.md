The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, `chosen_route` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is between 1 and 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (s_i, d_i), `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2**.
