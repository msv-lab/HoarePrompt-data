According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable) is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100). Since we want the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be adjusted to account for the next iteration. 

If the loop has executed `n` times, the next iteration would require `n` to be incremented to `n + 1` (or the loop should still be able to execute if it hasn't reached its limit). However, since `n` is a fixed positive integer, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that it has already completed `n` iterations. 

Thus, the state needs to reflect that `_` should be `n` (indicating that the loop has completed its iterations) and we need to ensure that `n` is still valid for another iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` is a list containing one tuple (s, d), `_` is n**
