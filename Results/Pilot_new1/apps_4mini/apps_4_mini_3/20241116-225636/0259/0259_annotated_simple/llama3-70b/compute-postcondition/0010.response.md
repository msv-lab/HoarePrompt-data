The code appends a new tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are assigned from input, but the specific values are not provided in the initial state. The variable `n` is not affected by this operation, and `t` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state describes the addition of the new tuple to `buses` while maintaining the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 100, `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `buses` contains the original tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
