Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` and returns its English string representation for numbers between 0 and 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99, it returns the string from the `tens` list if `n` is a multiple of 10, or it returns a hyphenated string combining the tens and ones representations if `n` is not a multiple of 10. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 0 or greater than 99, as these are outside the specified precondition.**
