The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. After executing the function body, if `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the string representation from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the string representation from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive, and if `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation based on specific conditions related to its value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns its string representation based on the following conditions: if n is between 0 and 9 inclusive, it returns the corresponding string from the ones list; if n is between 11 and 19 inclusive, it returns the corresponding string from the teens list; if n is between 10 and 99 inclusive and a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the tens list; if n is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, it returns the string in the format tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10].**
