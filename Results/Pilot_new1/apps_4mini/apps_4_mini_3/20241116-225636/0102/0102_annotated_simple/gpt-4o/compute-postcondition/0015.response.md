Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place corresponding to `tens[n // 10]`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`, effectively covering all values of `n` from 10 to 99. If `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19, these cases are handled by the precondition and do not affect the return values within the specified range.***
