Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99, `n` is an integer such that `n` is less than 0 or greater than 9. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the string representation of `n` from the `teens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive, and `n` is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive and not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format `tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]`, effectively covering all values of `n` from 10 to 99. Cases where `n` is less than 10 or greater than 19 are not applicable due to the precondition.***
