Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the printed output corresponds to `ones[s]`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the printed output corresponds to `teens[s - 10]`. If `s` is 20 or greater, the printed output represents the tens and ones places of `s`, formatted using the `tens` and `ones` lists, ensuring that if `s` is a multiple of ten, no hyphen and ones value is appended. This covers all cases for integers from 0 upwards, including edge cases for exact multiples of ten and the transition between the `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` categories.***
