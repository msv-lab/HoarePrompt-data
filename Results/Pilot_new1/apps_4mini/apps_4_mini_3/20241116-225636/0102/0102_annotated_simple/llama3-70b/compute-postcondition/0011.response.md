Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 10. If `s` is less than 20, the printed output corresponds to the string representation of `s` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the printed output represents the tens and ones places of `s`, formatted using the `tens` and `ones` lists, respectively, ensuring that if `s` is a multiple of ten, no hyphen and ones value is appended.***
