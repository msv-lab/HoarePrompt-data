The code constructs a string representation of the integer `s` based on its tens and ones place. Given that `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 20, we can determine its tens and ones place values. The tens place is obtained by performing integer division of `s` by 10 (`s // 10`), and the ones place is obtained using the modulus operator (`s % 10`).

1. `tens[s // 10]` retrieves the corresponding string for the tens place.
2. If `s % 10` equals 0, it means there are no ones to append, so we concatenate an empty string.
3. If `s % 10` is not 0, we append a hyphen followed by the corresponding string from the `ones` list.

Thus, the output will be the string representation of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is an integer greater than or equal to 20, and the printed output is the string representation of `s` based on its tens and ones place.**
