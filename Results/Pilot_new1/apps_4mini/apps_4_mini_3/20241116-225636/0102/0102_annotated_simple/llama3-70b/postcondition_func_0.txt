The function accepts an integer input `s` (expected to be between 0 and 99) and prints its English word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word representation formatted with the `tens` and `ones` lists, ensuring that if `s` is a multiple of ten (like 20, 30, etc.), it does not append a hyphen or ones value. However, the function does not handle cases where `s` is negative or greater than 99, and it does not return any value; it only prints the result.
