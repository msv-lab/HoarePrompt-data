Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `s` from the user, which should be between 0 and 99, and prints its English word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word representation by combining the appropriate string from the `tens` list with the string from the `ones` list, using a hyphen if there is a non-zero value in the ones place. However, if `s` is less than 0 or greater than 99, the function does not handle these cases, which could lead to an error when accessing the lists. Therefore, it does not account for invalid inputs.**
