Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string representation of `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the function prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the function prints the string representation of `s` in words by combining the appropriate string from the `tens` list with the string from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen if the ones place is non-zero.***
