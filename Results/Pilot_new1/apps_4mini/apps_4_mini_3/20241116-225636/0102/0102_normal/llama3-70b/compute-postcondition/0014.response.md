Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input from the user and prints its English word representation for numbers from 0 to 99. If the input is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list. For numbers between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the `teens` list. For numbers 20 and above, it constructs the word representation by combining the appropriate word from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the corresponding word from the `ones` list if the number is not a multiple of 10. However, the function does not handle numbers greater than 99 or the case when the input is 0, which is not explicitly represented in the lists provided. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result.**
