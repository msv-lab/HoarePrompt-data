Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer. If `s` is less than 10, the function prints the string representation from the `ones` list corresponding to `s`. If `s` is between 10 and 19 (inclusive), it prints the corresponding string from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the word representation of `s`, which is formed by concatenating the appropriate string from the `tens` list with either an empty string or a hyphen followed by the string from the `ones` list, depending on whether `s` is a multiple of 10. The function handles all integers, including edge cases such as `s = 0` (which is not explicitly handled but is assumed to be outside the expected range for this fragment) and integers greater than 99, which are not accounted for in the lists provided.***
