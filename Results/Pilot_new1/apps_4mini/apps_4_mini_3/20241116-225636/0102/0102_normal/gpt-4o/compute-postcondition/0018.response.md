The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. The function returns a string representation based on the value of `n` as follows:

- If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string representation from the `ones` list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the `teens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99, and `n` is a multiple of 10, it returns the corresponding string from the `tens` list.
- If `n` is between 10 and 99 but not a multiple of 10, it returns a string in the format 'tens' + '-' + 'ones', where 'tens' is the string representation of the tens place of `n`, and 'ones' is the string representation of the units place of `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its corresponding string representation based on specified rules for ones, teens, and tens. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns the string representation of n based on its value, handling cases for ones, teens, and tens.**
