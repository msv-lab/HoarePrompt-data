Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` may also be updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged. In all cases, `max_divisor` will either retain its original value or be updated based on the maximum values derived from `i` and `gcd // i`.***
