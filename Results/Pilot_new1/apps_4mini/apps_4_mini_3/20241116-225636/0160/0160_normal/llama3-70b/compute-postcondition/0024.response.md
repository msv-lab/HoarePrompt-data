According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, which means that `i` has exceeded the upper limit of the loop condition.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted back to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` and the range should still allow for it. Additionally, since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, we need to ensure that `gcd` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` for the loop to be able to execute again.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`**
