According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented. 

Since the loop iterates from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and currently `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now greater than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

The state of `gcd` does not need to change, as it remains greater than or equal to 1. However, since `i` is at its maximum value, we need to adjust it to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` to indicate that the loop will not execute again.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`**
