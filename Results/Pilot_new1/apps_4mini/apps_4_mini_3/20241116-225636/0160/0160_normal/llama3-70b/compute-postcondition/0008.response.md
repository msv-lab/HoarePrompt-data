The value of `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[i])`, where `i` is 3. The previous value of `gcd` is the result of `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`, and `A[i]` is the fourth element of the list `A`. 

Since `N` is between 2 and 500, `A` contains at least 4 elements. The value of `gcd` will change based on the current value of `gcd` and the value of `A[3]`. The exact new value of `gcd` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values in `A`, but it will be the greatest common divisor of the previous `gcd` and `A[3]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[i])`, and `i` is 3.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[i])`, and `i` is 3**
