The value of `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, so `gcd // i` calculates the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. The `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `gcd // i`. The exact new value of `max_divisor` depends on the specific values of `max_divisor` and `gcd`. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and `max_divisor` is updated to either its previous value or the value of `gcd // i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to int(math.sqrt(gcd)), and `max_divisor` is updated to either its previous value or gcd // i**
