According to the code, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `K` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= K <= int(math.sqrt(x)) - 1`. This implies that the last value of `i` used in the loop was `int(math.sqrt(x)) - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x))`, which is the next value in the range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be `int(math.sqrt(x))` for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted as `N`, `K`, `A`, and `divisors` are not directly affected by the loop's iteration condition.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= int(math.sqrt(x)); `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6; `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)), `divisors` is a set that now includes both `int(math.sqrt(x))` and `x // int(math.sqrt(x))` if `x` is divisible by `int(math.sqrt(x))`.**
