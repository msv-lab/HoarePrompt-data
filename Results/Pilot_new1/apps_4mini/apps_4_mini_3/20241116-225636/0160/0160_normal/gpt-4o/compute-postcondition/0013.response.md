Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= int(math.sqrt(x)) - 1; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` is a set that now includes both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the set `divisors` remains unchanged.***
