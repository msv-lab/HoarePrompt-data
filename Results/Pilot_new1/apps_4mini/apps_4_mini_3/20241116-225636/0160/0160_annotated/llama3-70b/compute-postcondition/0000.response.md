The values of `N` and `K` are assigned the results of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` accepts input values and `map` converts them to integers. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not known since they are derived from user input. The list `A` remains unaffected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment of `N` and `K` from the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer from input, `K` is a non-negative integer from input, and `A` is a list of N integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6**
