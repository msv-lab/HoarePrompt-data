The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `A`, which is `A[0]`. The values of `N`, `K`, and the contents of list `A` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the value of `gcd` based on the first element of the list `A`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer from input, `K` is a non-negative integer from input, `A` is a list of N integers from input, and `gcd` is A[0]**
