According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `gcd`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute, `gcd` must be a positive integer, as the square root of a non-positive number does not yield a valid range for the loop. 

Assuming `gcd` is positive, the loop will start with `i` equal to 1. Thus, we need to ensure that `gcd` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 1.

State: **`max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
