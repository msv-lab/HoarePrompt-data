According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is greater than 1, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to `N-1`. The values of `K`, `A`, and `gcd` do not affect the ability of the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1.

To ensure the loop can execute, `N` must be greater than 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` is initialized to 1.

State: **`N` is greater than 1, `K` is a non-negative integer, `A` is a list of N integers, `gcd` is A[0], `i` is 1**
