The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. 

- `N` is an integer that must be between 2 and 500.
- `K` is a non-negative integer that can be as large as 10^9.
- `A` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^6.

The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the logic defined within it. However, since the exact output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we can only summarize the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (between 2 and 500), a non-negative integer K (up to 10^9), and a list A of N integers (each between 1 and 10^6).**
