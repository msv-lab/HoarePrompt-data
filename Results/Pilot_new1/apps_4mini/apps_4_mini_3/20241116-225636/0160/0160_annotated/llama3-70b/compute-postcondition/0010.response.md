Output State: **If N is greater than 1, then `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, and `i` will be equal to N-1 after the loop completes. If N is 1, the loop does not execute and `gcd` remains as A[0]. If N is less than 1, the loop does not execute and this scenario is invalid since N should be a positive integer.**
