The code snippet `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is given as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, and since `x` is at least 1, `i` will be at least 2. The initial state of the variables does not change, but `divisors` will now include the value of `i`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that now includes the value of `i`, `x` is at least 1, and `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that now includes the value of `i`, `x` is at least 1, and `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1.**
