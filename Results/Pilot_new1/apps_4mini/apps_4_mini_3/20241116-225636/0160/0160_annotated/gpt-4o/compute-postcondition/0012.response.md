The variable `divisors` is updated to include the value `x // i`. The values of `x` and `i` are provided, where `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The exact values of `x` and `i` are not given, but we know that `x` is at least 1 and `i` will be at least 2 (since `math.sqrt(x)` will be at least 1). Therefore, `x // i` will yield a value that depends on the specific values of `x` and `i`.

Since the initial state does not provide exact values for `x` or `i`, we cannot determine a specific value for `x // i`. However, we can conclude that `divisors` will include a new value after this operation.

Output State: **`divisors` is updated to include `x // i`, where `x` is at least 1 and `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
