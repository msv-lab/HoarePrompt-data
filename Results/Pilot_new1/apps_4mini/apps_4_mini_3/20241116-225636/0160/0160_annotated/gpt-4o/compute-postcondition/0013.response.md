Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is an integer such that 1 <= `A[i]` <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set, and `x` is at least 1 with `i` being int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` is updated to include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `divisors` remains unchanged.***
