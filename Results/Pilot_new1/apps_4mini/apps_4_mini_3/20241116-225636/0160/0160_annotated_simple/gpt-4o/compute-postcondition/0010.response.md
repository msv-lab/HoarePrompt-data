According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to reflect this increment.

The value of `x` does not change and the other states (`N`, `K`, and `A`) are not affected by this loop. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1**
