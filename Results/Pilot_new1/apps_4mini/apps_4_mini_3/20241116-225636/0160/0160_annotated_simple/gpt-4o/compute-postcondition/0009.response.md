Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is a positive integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `divisors` will include both `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the `divisors` set remains unchanged.***
