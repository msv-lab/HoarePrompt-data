Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `x` and returns a sorted list of its divisors in descending order. If `x` is 0 or negative, which should not happen given the constraints, the function would not execute the loop and would return an empty list. Additionally, if `x` is 1, the function will return a list containing only the number 1 as its divisor. If `x` is a prime number, the returned list will only include 1 and `x` itself. **
