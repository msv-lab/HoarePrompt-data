The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list. If the list contains fewer than two elements, it returns the first element of the list as the gcd. The function does not handle cases where the list is empty, which would lead to an IndexError when trying to access `lst[0]`.
