The code takes input for `N` and `K`, where `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `K` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The input values are assigned to `N` and `K` respectively. The list `A` is not affected by this line of code, as it is not modified or assigned at this point.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9**
