The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is the first element of the list `A`. The initial states of `N`, `K`, and `A` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `N` and `K`, along with the newly assigned value of `gcd`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, `gcd` is A[0]**
