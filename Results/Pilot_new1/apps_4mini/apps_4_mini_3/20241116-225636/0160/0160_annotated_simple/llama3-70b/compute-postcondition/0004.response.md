The variable `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and the next element in the list `A`, which is `A[i]`. The initial value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `i` is 1, so `A[i]` is `A[1]`. The value of `gcd` will now be the `gcd` of `A[0]` and `A[1]`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, `gcd` is gcd(A[0], A[1]), `i` is 1**
