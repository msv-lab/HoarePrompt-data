The value of `gcd` is updated by computing the GCD of the current `gcd` and `A[i]`. The previous value of `gcd` is `gcd(A[0], A[1])`, and `A[i]` is an integer from the list `A`. Therefore, after execution, `gcd` will hold the new GCD value. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers from input, `gcd` is updated to gcd(gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[i]), `i` is 2**
