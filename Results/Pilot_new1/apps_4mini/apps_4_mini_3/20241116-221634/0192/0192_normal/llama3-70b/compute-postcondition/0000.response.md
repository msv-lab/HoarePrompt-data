The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the input from the user, where `input` will accept two integers separated by a space, and `map(int, ...)` will convert those inputs into integers. The constraints given are that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning that `y` must be at least 3 and less than `x`, which must be at most 100,000. Other variables remain unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x` and `y` are now assigned values based on user input while maintaining the constraints.

Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `y`, `y` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and both are within the range specified.**
