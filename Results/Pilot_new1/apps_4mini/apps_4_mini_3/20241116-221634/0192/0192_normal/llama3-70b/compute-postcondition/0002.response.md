The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine the return value or any conditions that would lead to different outputs.

Given this information, the functionality of the function `func` is not clearly defined without further details on its output. Therefore, we cannot provide a complete description of its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, and its return value is unspecified based on the provided information.**
