The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates on two integers, `x` and `y`, which are constrained such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the return value or behavior of the function based on the available data.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on integers x and y, constrained by 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The output is not specified.**
