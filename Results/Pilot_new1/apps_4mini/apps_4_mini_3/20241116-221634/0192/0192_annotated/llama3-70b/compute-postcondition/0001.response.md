The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `x` and `y` are input integers satisfying the condition \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\), we know that \(x\) is always greater than \(y\). Therefore, the absolute difference can be calculated as \(x - y\).

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, we denote the output as the absolute difference between the two variables.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned input integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; the output is abs(`x` - `y`) which equals `x - y`**
