The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any output as per the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers `x` and `y` within the specified constraints, but it does not produce a return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but does not return any output.**
