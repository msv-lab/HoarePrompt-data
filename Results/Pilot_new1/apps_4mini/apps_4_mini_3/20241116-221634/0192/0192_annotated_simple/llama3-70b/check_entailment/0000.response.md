Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem states that Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle in each second while maintaining the properties of a non-degenerate triangle. The program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints that value.

This approach is incorrect because the number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` to one of side length `y` is not simply the difference `|x - y|`. Instead, it requires a series of operations that must ensure that the triangle remains valid at all times.

For example, consider the input `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The program will output `3`, but the correct sequence of operations requires 4 seconds as shown in the problem statement, leading to the correct output of `4`. 

Therefore, since the program fails to handle the problem correctly for at least one case, it is deemed incorrect.
