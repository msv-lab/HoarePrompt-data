The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as it is defined without any parameters in its signature. However, it operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). The function's output is not explicitly stated in the provided information. Therefore, without knowing the specific output behavior of the function, we cannot define its functionality in terms of return values.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific output behavior is not provided.**
