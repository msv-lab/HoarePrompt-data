The value of `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, which calculates 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), `total_days` will be a very large number, specifically \(2^n\). The values of `n` and `k` are not directly affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\); `k` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{18}\); `total_days` is \(2^n\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is 2^n**
