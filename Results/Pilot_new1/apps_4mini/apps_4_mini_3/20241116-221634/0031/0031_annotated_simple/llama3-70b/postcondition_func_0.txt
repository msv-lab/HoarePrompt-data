The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is used to calculate `total_days` as \(2^n\), and `k` determines the number of iterations in the loop. It computes the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` as the `numerator`, and `2^n` raised to the power of `k` as the `denominator`. After calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the numerator and denominator, it simplifies them and returns the results of `numerator % (10^6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10^6 + 3)`. The function does not handle the case where `k` is less than 2, which would lead to the numerator and denominator remaining 1, potentially resulting in a division by zero error when calculating the gcd.
