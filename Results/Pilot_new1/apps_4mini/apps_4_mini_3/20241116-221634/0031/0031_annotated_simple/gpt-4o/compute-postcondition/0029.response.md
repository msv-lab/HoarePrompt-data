Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It checks if `k` is greater than \(2^n\). If it is, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^n\), the function calculates a numerator and denominator based on `k` and `n`, computes values `A` and `B`, and prints their reduced forms modulo 1000003. However, the function does not handle cases where `k` is less than 2, and does not return any values; it only prints output. **
