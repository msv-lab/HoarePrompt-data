The variable `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. The value of `numerator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), which is not changed by this assignment. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `total_days` is \(2^n\), `k` is at least 2, and `p_no_shared` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\).

Output State: **`numerator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003)^2 \mod 1000003\), `total_days` is \(2^n\), `k` is at least 2, `p_no_shared` is \( (2^n \mod 1000003) * (2^n - 1) \mod 1000003\)**
