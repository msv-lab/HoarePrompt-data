The code assigns a constant value to `MOD`, calculated as \(10^6 + 3\). The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state describes the unchanged integers and the newly defined constant.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `MOD` is 1000003**
