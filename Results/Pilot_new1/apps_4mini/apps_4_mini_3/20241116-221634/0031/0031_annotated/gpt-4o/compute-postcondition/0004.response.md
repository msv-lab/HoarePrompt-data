Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the program prints (1, 1) and terminates without returning a value. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the program does not print anything and simply exits.***
