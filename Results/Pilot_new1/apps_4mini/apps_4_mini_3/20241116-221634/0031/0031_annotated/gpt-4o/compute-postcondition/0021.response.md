The variable `p_shared` is assigned the value of the expression `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The values of `p_total` and `p_no_shared` are previously assigned, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot calculate an exact numerical result for `p_shared`. However, we can express the relationship based on the existing variables.

The output state will reflect that `p_shared` is calculated based on the current values of `p_total`, `p_no_shared`, and `MOD`. 

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned based on `k`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`; `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD**
