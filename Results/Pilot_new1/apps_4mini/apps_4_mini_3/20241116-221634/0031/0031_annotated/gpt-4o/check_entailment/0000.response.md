To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The program is supposed to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people have the same birthday when there are `2^n` days in a year. The result should be expressed as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime, and the output values must be given modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The output is correct for GCD computations and will be used later to reduce \( A \) and \( B \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The first check `if (k > 1 << n)` handles the case where the number of people exceeds the number of days. In this case, it prints `(1, 1)`, which is correct because if there are more people than days, at least two must share a birthday.
   - The loop calculates the numerator and denominator for the probability of no shared birthdays. The numerator is the product of available days for each person, and the denominator is simply \( total\_days^k \).
   - The shared probability is calculated correctly by subtracting the probability of no shared birthdays from the total probability.
   - The GCD is computed to reduce \( A \) and \( B \) before printing.

### Edge Cases
- The check for \( k > 2^n \) is correct as it guarantees that at least two people will share a birthday.
- The output of \( A \) and \( B \) is reduced by their GCD, ensuring they are coprime before taking the modulo.

### Potential Issues
1. **Large Values of `n` and `k`**: The constraints allow for very large integers (up to \( 10^{18} \)). The calculation of \( total\_days - i \) and \( total\_days^k \) could result in very large numbers, leading to performance issues or overflow in languages not handling large integers. However, Python handles large integers well, so this is not a direct issue with the current implementation.
   
2. **Correctness of the Loop**: The loop iterates `k` times to calculate the numerator and denominator. However, if \( k \) is significantly larger than \( 2^n \), the loop could become inefficient and unnecessary calculations could be performed. The check for \( k > 2^n \) already handles this, so it seems to be managed correctly.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The program applies modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \) after reducing \( A \) and \( B \). Since \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime before taking the modulo, this is handled correctly as well.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and the annotations, I find that the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. It handles edge cases appropriately and reduces the output correctly. 

Therefore, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**
