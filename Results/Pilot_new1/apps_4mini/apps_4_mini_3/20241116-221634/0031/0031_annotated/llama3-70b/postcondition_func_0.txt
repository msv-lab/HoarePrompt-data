The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`. It calculates `total_days` as \(2^n\), then computes a `numerator` as the product of \((2^n - i)\) for `i` in the range of `k`, and a `denominator` as \(2^{(k \cdot n)}\). After that, it reduces the `numerator` and `denominator` by their greatest common divisor (gcd) and returns both values modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, leaving `numerator` and `denominator` as 1, which will also be reduced by gcd. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are out of expected bounds, such as negative values or values greater than \(10^{18}\).
