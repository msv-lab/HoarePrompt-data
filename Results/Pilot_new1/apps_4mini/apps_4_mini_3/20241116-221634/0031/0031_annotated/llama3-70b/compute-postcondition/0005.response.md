The code multiplies `denominator` by `total_days`. The initial value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is equal to `2^n`. Therefore, after executing the code, `denominator` will be updated to `1 * 2^n`, which is `2^n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2^n, `numerator` is 2^n, `denominator` is 2^n, `i` is 0**
