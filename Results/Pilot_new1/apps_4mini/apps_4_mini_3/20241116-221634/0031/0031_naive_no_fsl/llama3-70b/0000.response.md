To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1` and see if it aligns with the problem description. The task is to compute the probability that at least two people out of `k` share the same birthday given `2^n` days in a year.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Understanding the Probability**:
   - The probability that at least two people share a birthday can be derived from the complement probability: the probability that all `k` people have different birthdays.
   - The number of ways to assign different birthdays to `k` people from `2^n` days is given by:
     \[
     P(\text{all different}) = \frac{(2^n)(2^n - 1)(2^n - 2) \ldots (2^n - k + 1)}{(2^n)^k}
     \]
   - Therefore, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is:
     \[
     P(\text{at least one shared}) = 1 - P(\text{all different})
     \]

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > 2^n`, it is guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday. The output should be `1 1` in this case.
   - The program does not check for this edge case. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the current implementation would still compute the probability assuming all birthdays can be unique, which is incorrect.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly computes the numerator and denominator, but it fails to handle the case when `k > 2^n`, which should directly return `1 1`.

### Conclusion
Since the program does not handle the case where `k > 2^n`, it is incorrect. 

### Example of Failure
For the input:
```
3 9
```
This means there are `2^3 = 8` days and `k = 9` people. The program should return `1 1`, but it will attempt to compute the probability and give an incorrect result.

Correctness: **False**
