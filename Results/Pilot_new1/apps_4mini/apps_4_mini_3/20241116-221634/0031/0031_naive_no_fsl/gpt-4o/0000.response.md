To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and the handling of edge cases.

The program aims to compute the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday among `2^n` days. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where `A` and `B` are coprime and both are taken modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Input Constraints**: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`.
2. **Output Requirements**: If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the output should be `1 1` (since at least one shared birthday is guaranteed).
3. **Probability Calculation**: The program computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday by first calculating the probability of no shared birthdays and subtracting that from the total probability.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Greatest Common Divisor Function**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD, which is used to simplify `A` and `B`.
2. **Handling Large Values**: The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large values, which is appropriate given the constraints on `n` and `k`.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The check `if k > 1 << n` ensures that if there are more people than days, it immediately returns `1 1`, which is correct.
4. **Probability Calculation**: The loop calculates the numerator and denominator correctly, ensuring that it handles the cases where `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is `1`, which should return `0 1` since there cannot be a shared birthday with only one person.
- The program might also encounter issues with very large values of `n` and `k`, especially in the loop where it computes the probabilities. Python can handle large integers, but the logic must still be sound.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the probability of shared birthdays under the given constraints. However, it fails to handle the edge case where `k` is `1`, as it does not account for the fact that with only one person, there cannot be a shared birthday.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Example of Failure:
For the input `3 1`, the expected output should be `0 1`, but the program would incorrectly process this input without special handling for `k = 1`.
