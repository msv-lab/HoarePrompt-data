Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer) and `k` (an integer greater than or equal to 0). It calculates the numerator as the product of `2^n` and the descending integers from `2^n - 1` to `2^n - k + 1`, and the denominator as `2^(n*k)`. It then reduces the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and returns the reduced numerator and denominator modulo \(10^6 + 3\). If `k` is 0, the function returns (1, 1) since the loop does not execute, leaving the numerator and denominator unchanged.**
