The value of `numerator` is divided by `gcd`, which is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. This operation modifies the value of `numerator`, but the specific values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd` are not provided. Therefore, we can only state that `numerator` is now reduced by the factor of `gcd`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numerator` is reduced by the factor of `gcd`; `denominator` is \(2^{nk}\); `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
