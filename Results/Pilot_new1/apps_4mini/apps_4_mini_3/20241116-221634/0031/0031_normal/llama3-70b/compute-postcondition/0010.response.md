The value of `numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`. Given that `total_days` is \(2^n\) and `i` is 2, the calculation becomes:

\[
total\_days - i = 2^n - 2
\]

Now, we can express the new value of `numerator` as:

\[
numerator = numerator \times (2^n - 2)
\]

The previous value of `numerator` is \(2^n \times (2^n - 1)\). Thus, after the multiplication, we have:

\[
numerator = (2^n \times (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2)
\]

The other variables `n`, `k`, `total_days`, `denominator`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \((2^n \times (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2)\), `denominator` is \(2^{2n}\), `i` is 2**
