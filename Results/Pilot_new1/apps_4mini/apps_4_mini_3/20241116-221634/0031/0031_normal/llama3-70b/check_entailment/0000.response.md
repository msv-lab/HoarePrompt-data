To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to compute the probability that at least two people share the same birthday among `2^n` days when `k` people are chosen. The result should be given as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.

### Code Analysis
The code defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that:
1. Calculates the total number of days as \( 2^n \).
2. Computes the numerator as the product of \( 2^n \) and the descending integers from \( 2^n - 1 \) to \( 2^n - k + 1 \).
3. Computes the denominator as \( (2^n)^k \).
4. Reduces the fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.
5. Returns the reduced numerator and denominator modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Potential Edge Cases
1. When \( k > 2^n \): In this case, it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, and the probability should be \( \frac{1}{1} \).
2. When \( k = 0 \): The function should return \( (1, 1) \) since the loop does not execute, which is consistent with the definition of probability in this context.
3. When \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 2 \): The expected output is \( \frac{1}{2} \) since there are 2 days and 2 people, which results in a 50% chance of sharing a birthday.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe the function's behavior accurately, particularly regarding the calculation of the numerator and denominator and the reduction of the fraction. However, they do not explicitly mention the edge cases, such as when \( k > 2^n \).

### Conclusion
The code does not handle the case where \( k > 2^n \) correctly, as it would not return \( (1, 1) \) in that scenario, which is a requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle the edge case where \( k > 2^n \), which should return \( (1, 1) \) but will instead proceed with the calculation and potentially yield incorrect results.
