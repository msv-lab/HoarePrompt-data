The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Since `total_days` is \(2^n\), the new value of `denominator` becomes \(2^n \times (2^n) = 2^{2n}\). The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n \times (2^n - 1)\), `denominator` is \(2^{2n}\), `i` is 1.
