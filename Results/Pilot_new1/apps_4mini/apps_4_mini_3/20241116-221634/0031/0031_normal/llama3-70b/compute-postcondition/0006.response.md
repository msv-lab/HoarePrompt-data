According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and it must still be less than `k`. Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to 1. The values of `n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator` do not need to be adjusted as they are not affected by the loop iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n\), `denominator` is \(2^n\), `i` is 1**
