The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. The initial value of `total_days` is \(2^n\), and the previous value of `denominator` is \(2^{2n}\). Therefore, the new value of `denominator` becomes \(2^{2n} \times 2^n = 2^{2n + n} = 2^{3n}\). The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \((2^n \times (2^n - 1)) \times (2^n - 2)\), `denominator` is \(2^{3n}\), `i` is 2**
