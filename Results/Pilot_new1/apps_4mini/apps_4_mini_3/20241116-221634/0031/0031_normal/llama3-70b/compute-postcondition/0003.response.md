According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. Since `n` is a positive integer, `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), which does not affect the loop's execution directly. The variables `numerator` and `denominator` are initialized to 1, which also does not impact the loop's execution.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `i` will have gone from 0 to \(k-1\), meaning that before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than 0, `total_days` is calculated as \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
