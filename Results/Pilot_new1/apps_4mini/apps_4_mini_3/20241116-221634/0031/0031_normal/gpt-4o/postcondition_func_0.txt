The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0 at the start, the function returns the unchanged value of `a`. The function does not explicitly check for negative inputs; hence it may not behave as intended for negative values of `a` or `b`.
