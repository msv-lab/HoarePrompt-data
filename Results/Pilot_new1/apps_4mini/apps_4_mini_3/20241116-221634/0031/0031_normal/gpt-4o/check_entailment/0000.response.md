To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description
The task is to compute the probability that at least two of `k` people have the same birthday among `2^n` days, and return this probability as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime and must be printed modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Function Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. 
   - The output description notes that it does not explicitly check for negative inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior if negative numbers are provided.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function checks if `k` exceeds `2^n`. If it does, it correctly outputs `(1, 1)` since it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, it computes the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday using combinatorial calculations:
     - It calculates the numerator as the product of the remaining days available for each person.
     - The denominator is simply the total number of combinations.
     - After computing these values, it calculates the shared probability, reduces the fraction using the GCD, and prints the result modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases
- When `k` is very large (greater than `2^n`), the program handles this case correctly.
- The function does not explicitly handle negative values for `n` and `k`. However, according to the problem constraints, both `n` and `k` are guaranteed to be positive integers within specified bounds. Therefore, this specific edge case might not need to be handled, but it could lead to incorrect behavior if the constraints were violated.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints for both functions describe their behavior correctly:
- For `func_1`, the output hint correctly states that it returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, but it lacks handling for negative values.
- For `func_2`, the output hint accurately describes its logic and how it computes the probability. It confirms that the function handles the calculation of `A` and `B` correctly and prints them in the required format.

### Conclusion
The program is designed to follow the problem description, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality. However, the potential issue of negative inputs in `func_1` could lead to incorrect results if such inputs were allowed, even though the problem constraints imply that they will not be.

Given that the program does not cover every potential case (i.e., negative values), I conclude that the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**.
