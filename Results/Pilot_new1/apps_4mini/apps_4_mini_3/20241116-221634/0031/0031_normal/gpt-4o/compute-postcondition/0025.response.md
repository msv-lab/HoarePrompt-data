To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State:
- `A` is `p_shared`
- `p_no_shared` is `numerator`
- `p_total` is `denominator`
- `B` is `p_total`
- `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`

The line of code to analyze is:
```
A //= g
```

Here, `A` is being modified by performing an integer floor division with the value of `g`. The value of `g` is the result of calling `func_1(A, B)`, but we do not know the specific value returned by `func_1`. Therefore, we can only state that `A` will be updated based on the result of that function.

Since the exact values of `A`, `B`, and `g` are not provided (only their references), we cannot determine specific values for them after the operation. However, we can conclude that `A` is updated to be the result of the floor division of its previous value by `g`.

Thus, the output state reflects the changes to `A` and the existing values of the other variables:

Output State: **`A` is updated by floor dividing its previous value by `g`, `p_no_shared` is `numerator`, `p_total` is `denominator`, `B` is `p_total`, `g` is the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`**
