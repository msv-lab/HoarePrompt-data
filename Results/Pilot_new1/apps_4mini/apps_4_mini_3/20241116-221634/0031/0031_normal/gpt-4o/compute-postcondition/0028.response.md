The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, the function prints (1, 1) and returns. If `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`, the function does not produce any output or return value and continues execution without any specific return statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and it prints (1, 1) if `k` exceeds `2^n`, while doing nothing if `k` is within the limit. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, prints (1, 1) if k is greater than 2^n, and does nothing if k is less than or equal to 2^n.**
