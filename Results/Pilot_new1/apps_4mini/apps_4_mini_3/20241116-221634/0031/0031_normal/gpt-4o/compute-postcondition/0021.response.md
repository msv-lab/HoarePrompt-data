The value of `p_total` is `denominator`, and the value of `p_no_shared` is `numerator`. The code calculates `p_shared` by subtracting `p_no_shared` from `p_total`, adding `MOD`, and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. This calculation does not affect the values of `p_no_shared` or `p_total`. Therefore, the output state is: `numerator` is the product of `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `total_days` down to `total_days - (k - 1)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k` modulo `MOD`, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`**.
