The code prints the values `1` and `1`. The values of `n` and `k` do not change as the print statement does not affect their state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for `n` and `k`, while the print statement outputs `1` and `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `k` is greater than 2 raised to the power of `n`, and the output is 1, 1**
