According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. The loop will execute again if the current value of `i` is greater than `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, which means it is currently at `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `-1`, and since `i` is iterating down, there are no further adjustments needed for `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, or `remainder`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 2`, and `i` is -1**
