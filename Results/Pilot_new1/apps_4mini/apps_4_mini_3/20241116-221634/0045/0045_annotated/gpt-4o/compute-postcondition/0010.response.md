Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum`. If `remainder` is 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating that the sequence can be fully formed without any remaining value. If `remainder` is not 0, the program continues execution, but this specific case is not handled in the provided fragment.***
