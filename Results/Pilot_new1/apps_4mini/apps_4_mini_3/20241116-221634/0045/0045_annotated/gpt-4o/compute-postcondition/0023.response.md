According to the code, the for loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. The current value of `i` is `-1`, which indicates that the loop has completed its iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1`, as that is the starting point of the loop.

The other states do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only necessary adjustment is to reset `i` to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is `n - d * min_sum - 3`, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1**
