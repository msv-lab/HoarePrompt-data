To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   The program calculates `min_sum` as the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is given by the formula \( k * (k + 1) / 2 \). This is correct because the smallest strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers is \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \).

2. **Checking Feasibility**:
   The program checks if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. If it is, the function returns -1, which is correct because it is impossible to form a sequence of `k` strictly increasing positive integers that sum to `n`.

3. **Dividing n by min_sum**:
   The program calculates `d` as \( n // min_sum \) to determine how many times we can multiply the minimum sequence by a common factor. This is a valid approach to maximize the GCD.

4. **Calculating Remainder**:
   The program computes `remainder` as \( n - d * min_sum \). This remainder is used to distribute additional increments to the sequence to ensure that the sum equals `n`.

5. **Building the Sequence**:
   The program constructs the sequence as a list comprehension where each element is \( d * (i + 1) \). It then adjusts the last elements of the sequence to account for the `remainder`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Case when k = 1**: 
  - If \( n = 1 \), the output should be `[1]` which is correct.
  - If \( n = 2 \), the output should be `[2]` which is also correct.
  
- **Case when k > n**:
  - For example, \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \). The minimum sum \( min_sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 \) which is greater than 5. The program correctly returns -1.

- **Case when n is not enough to form a valid sequence**:
  - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \), the minimum sum needed is 6, hence the program correctly returns -1.

- **Multiple valid outputs**:
  - For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 2 \), the program could return `[2, 6]` or `[3, 5]` or any valid pair that sums to 8. The program handles this by distributing the remainder correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle all edge cases and follows the problem description correctly. There are no identified cases where it fails to produce the expected output based on the problem requirements.

Thus, after thorough analysis, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
