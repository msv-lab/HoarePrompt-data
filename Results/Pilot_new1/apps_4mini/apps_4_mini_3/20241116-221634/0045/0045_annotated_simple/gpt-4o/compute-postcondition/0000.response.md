The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers within the range specified, the output state will reflect the value of `min_sum` based on the value of `k`. The variable `n` remains unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is k * (k + 1) // 2**
