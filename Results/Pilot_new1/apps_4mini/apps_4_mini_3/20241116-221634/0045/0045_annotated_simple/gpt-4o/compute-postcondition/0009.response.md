The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to 0, `sequence` is a list of `k` elements calculated as [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)], `i` is `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
