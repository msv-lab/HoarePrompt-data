According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop will continue to execute while `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 1` (the next value in the range). Since `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `k - 1` will be at least 0, allowing the loop to run again. 

Additionally, since `remainder` is decreased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will need to be adjusted to reflect that it has been decreased again. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be `k - 1`
- `remainder` should be decreased by 1 from its previous state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `i` is `k - 1`, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
