The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers, constrained such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

In Case 1, if the minimum sum calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1, indicating that the minimum sum required exceeds the provided value of `n`. 

In Case 2, if the condition for returning -1 is not met, the function returns a sequence that contains the original values plus the number of times the loop executed (up to `k`), or the values remain unchanged if the remainder is 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, check if the minimum sum required based on `k` exceeds `n`, and return -1 if it does. If it does not exceed, the function returns a sequence based on the loop execution or the original values unchanged. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns -1 if the minimum sum required exceeds `n`. If not, it returns a sequence based on the loop execution or the original values unchanged.**
