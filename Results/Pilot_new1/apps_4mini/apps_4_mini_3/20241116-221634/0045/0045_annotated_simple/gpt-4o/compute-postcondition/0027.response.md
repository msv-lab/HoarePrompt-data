Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` consecutive integers starting from 1. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. If not, it calculates how many times this minimum sum can fit into `n` and distributes any remaining value across the sequence. The function returns a list representing a sequence of `k` integers that sum up to `n`, where the integers are adjusted based on the remainder. If `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, the sequence will consist of the first `k` integers. **
