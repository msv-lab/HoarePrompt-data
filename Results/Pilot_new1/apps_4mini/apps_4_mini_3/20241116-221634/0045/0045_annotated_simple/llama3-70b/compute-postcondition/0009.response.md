Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is initially 0, it returns `a` as the GCD. If `b` is positive, it returns the last non-zero remainder of `a` when `b` becomes 0. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer types, which could lead to unexpected behavior. **
