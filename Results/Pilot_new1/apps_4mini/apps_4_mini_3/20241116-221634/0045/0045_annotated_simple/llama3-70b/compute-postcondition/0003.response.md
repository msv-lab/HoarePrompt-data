According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. The loop will continue as long as `b` is non-zero (truthy). At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the value of `a % b`, which is positive and not equal to 0. Since `b` is already positive and not equal to 0, the loop can execute again without needing any adjustments to the state.

State: **`a` is the previous value of `b`, `b` is the value of `a % b` (which is positive and not equal to 0)**
