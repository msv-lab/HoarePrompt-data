The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers, and the constraints specify that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. After executing the function, if `b` is positive, the function returns the last non-zero remainder of `a`. If `b` is initially 0, the function returns `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the last non-zero remainder of `a` when `b` is positive, or return `n` when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, returns the last non-zero remainder of `a` if `b` is positive, or returns `n` if `b` is initially 0.**
