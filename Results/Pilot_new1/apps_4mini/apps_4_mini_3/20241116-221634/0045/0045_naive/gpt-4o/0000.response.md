To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and consider edge cases.

The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximized. If such a sequence cannot be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   The program calculates the minimum sum required for `k` positive integers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest `k` positive integers are `1, 2, ..., k`.

2. **Check for Feasibility**: 
   If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it correctly returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to create such a sequence.

3. **Finding the GCD**: 
   The program attempts to maximize the GCD by calculating `d = n // min_sum`, which represents how many times we can multiply the minimum sequence `1, 2, ..., k` to stay within `n`.

4. **Creating the Sequence**: 
   It creates the sequence by multiplying the integers `1` to `k` by `d`. Then it distributes any remaining value (from `remainder = n - d * min_sum`) to the last elements of the sequence to ensure the sum equals `n`.

### Potential Issues:

- The program does not explicitly ensure that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximized. While it attempts to create a sequence that sums to `n`, there might be cases where the GCD is not maximized if the remainder is not handled correctly or if `d` is too small.
  
- The program does not handle the case where `k` is larger than `n`. In such cases, even if the minimum sum is not greater than `n`, it is impossible to form a valid sequence since we cannot have `k` positive integers that sum to `n`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:

Consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 6`. The minimum sum needed for `k=6` is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`, which is greater than `5`. However, if we have `n = 6` and `k = 6`, the program would incorrectly return a sequence like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` multiplied by `0`, which is invalid.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential issue identified, where the program does not handle cases where `k` is greater than `n` correctly, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
