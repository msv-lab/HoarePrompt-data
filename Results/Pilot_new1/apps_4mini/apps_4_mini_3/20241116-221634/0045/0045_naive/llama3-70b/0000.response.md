To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If it's not possible to create such a sequence, we should return `-1`.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

### Key Observations:
1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If true, it immediately returns `-1`, which is correct since we cannot form a sequence of `k` positive integers that sums to `n` in this case.
2. The program then attempts to create the sequence by appending integers from `1` to `k`. It keeps subtracting the added integers from `n`.
3. If the length of the sequence is not equal to `k`, it prints `-1`.

### Potential Issues:
1. The sequence generated (`1, 2, ..., k`) will always sum to `k * (k + 1) / 2`. If `n` is less than this sum, it will not be possible to find a valid sequence, and the program will correctly return `-1`.
2. However, if `n` is greater than or equal to the sum of `1, 2, ..., k`, the program does not ensure that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximized. It simply returns the sequence `1, 2, ..., k`, which may not have the maximal GCD if `n` is greater than `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

### Counterexample:
- Consider `n = 12` and `k = 3`. The program would output `1 2 3`, which sums to `6` and has a GCD of `1`. However, a better sequence would be `2 4 6`, which also sums to `12` and has a GCD of `2`, which is larger than `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee the maximal GCD for the sequence, as it only constructs the sequence from `1` to `k` without considering how to maximize the GCD based on the value of `n`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
