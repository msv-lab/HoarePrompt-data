The values of `a` and `b` are swapped in the assignment `a, b = b, a % b`. The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, and the new value of `b` becomes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Given that `a` is not a multiple of `b`, `a % b` will result in a non-zero value. 

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- Let the initial value of `a` be `x`.
- Let the initial value of `b` be `y`.

After executing the line `a, b = b, a % b`, we have:
- The new value of `a` is `y`.
- The new value of `b` is `x % y`, which is not zero since `a` is not a multiple of `b`.

Thus, the output state is: `a` is `y`, `b` is `x % y`.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `b` is `a % b`**
