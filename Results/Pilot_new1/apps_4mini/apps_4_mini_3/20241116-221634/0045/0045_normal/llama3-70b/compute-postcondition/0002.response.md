The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, where `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, the value of `b` will always be less than `a` after the operation. The specific values of `a` and `b` are not provided, but we know that `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a` is not a multiple of `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignments:

Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `a` is not a multiple of `b`**
