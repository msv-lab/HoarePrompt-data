According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero (i.e., evaluates to true), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` has been assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` is not a multiple of `b`, `a % b` is guaranteed to be non-zero, which means `b` is still non-zero. Therefore, the loop can execute again without needing any adjustments to the states.

State: **`a` is assigned the value of `b`, `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, and `a` is not a multiple of `b`**
