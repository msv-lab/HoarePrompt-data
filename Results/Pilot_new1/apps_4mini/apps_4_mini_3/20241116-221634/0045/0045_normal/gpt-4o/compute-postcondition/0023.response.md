According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `k`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 3`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased to `k - 4`. 

Since `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `k - 3` is valid, and the next value for `i` will be `k - 4`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `i` is now `k - 4`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop's execution. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `k - 4, sequence[i]` is unchanged**
