The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` consecutive integers starting from 1. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates how many complete sequences of this minimum sum can fit into `n`, and distributes any remaining value across the sequence elements. The function returns the final sequence of integers, which may have some elements incremented based on the remainder from the division of `n` by the minimum sum. If `k` is 0, the function will return an empty list.
