According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `k`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented to `k - 3`. 

Given that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `k - 2` is valid only when `k` is at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 3 so that `i` can be `k - 3`, which is valid.

Additionally, the `sequence[i]` has already been increased by 1 in the last iteration, and `remainder` has been decreased by 1. These values do not need further adjustments for the next iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `k` must be at least 3.
- `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 3`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` is decreased by 1**
