The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is equal to `k - 2`, and since `n` is a positive integer and `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is a valid index for the `sequence`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `remainder` are not affected by this operation, but `sequence[i]` is increased by 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `remainder` remains unchanged**
