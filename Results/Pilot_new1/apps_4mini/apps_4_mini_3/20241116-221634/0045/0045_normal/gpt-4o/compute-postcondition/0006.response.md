To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we first need to understand the variables involved:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which represents the sum of the first `k` positive integers.
- `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, representing how many complete sets of the first `k` integers fit into `n`.
- `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, representing what is left after taking out those complete sets.

Now, the code snippet:
```
sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
```
This creates a list called `sequence` where each element is calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`. 

The values for `sequence` will depend directly on the previously calculated value of `d` and the range of `k`. 

1. The first element of `sequence` will be `d * (1)`.
2. The second element will be `d * (2)`.
3. This continues up to the `k`-th element, which will be `d * (k)`.

Thus, the resulting sequence will be a list of the first `k` multiples of `d`.

The output state will summarize the values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and the generated sequence.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list of the first `k` multiples of `d`.**
