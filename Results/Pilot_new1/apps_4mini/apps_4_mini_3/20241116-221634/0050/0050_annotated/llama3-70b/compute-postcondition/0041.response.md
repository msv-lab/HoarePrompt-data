Postcondition: ***`r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]` and `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving `r`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `b` unchanged.***
