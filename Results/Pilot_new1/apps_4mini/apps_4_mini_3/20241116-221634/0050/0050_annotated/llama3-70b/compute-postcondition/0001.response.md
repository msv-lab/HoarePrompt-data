The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input that is split into separate values. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged. Since the actual input is not provided, we cannot determine the specific contents of the list `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `s` is now a list of integers derived from the input, while `n`, `m`, and `r` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a list of integers derived from input.**
