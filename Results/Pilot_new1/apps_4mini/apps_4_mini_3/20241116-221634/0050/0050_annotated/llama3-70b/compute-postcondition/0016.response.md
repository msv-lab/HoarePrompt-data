The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 greater than `i`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list, `b` is a sorted list in reverse order, `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]` and `r` is updated to `r % s[0]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, and `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
