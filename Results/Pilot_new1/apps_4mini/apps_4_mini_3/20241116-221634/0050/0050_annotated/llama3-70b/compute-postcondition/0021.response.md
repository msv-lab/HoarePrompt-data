The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 greater than `i + 1`, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list, `b` is a sorted list in reverse order, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
