The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged, `m` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, and `b` is unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
