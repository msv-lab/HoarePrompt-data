The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints `r`. Otherwise, it calculates how many shares can be bought with `r` at the minimum buy price, computes the remaining money after the purchase, and then calculates the total amount of money after selling those shares at the maximum sell price, which is also printed. The function does not return any value.
