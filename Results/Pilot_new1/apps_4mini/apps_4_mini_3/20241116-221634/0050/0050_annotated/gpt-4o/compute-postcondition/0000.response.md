The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The specific values for `n`, `m`, and `r` are not provided, but they must satisfy the conditions given in the initial state. Other variables (`s` and `b`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, `m` is an integer satisfying 1 <= m <= 30, `r` is an integer satisfying 1 <= r <= 1000**
