The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. The state of the list `s` changes to its sorted order, while the list `b` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the sorted state of `s` along with the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `r`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a sorted list of integers; `b` is a list of integers from input.**
