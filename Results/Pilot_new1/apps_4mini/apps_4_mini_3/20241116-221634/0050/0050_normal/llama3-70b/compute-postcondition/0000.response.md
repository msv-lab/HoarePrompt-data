The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input will provide three integers, which will be converted to integers and assigned to `n`, `m`, and `r` respectively. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not known, but we can confirm that they are now set to the values provided by the user input. The lists `s` and `b` remain unaffected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, and `s` and `b` remain unchanged.**
