Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is assigned from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is updated based on the value of `r` and `s[i]`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is increased by `r // s[i]`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `shares` remains 0 and the loop or if statement is exited, with `i` remaining 0. This also implies that if `r` is less than `s[i]`, no shares can be bought with the current value of `r`.***
