The function accepts input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, where `n` is the number of buying prices, `m` is the number of selling prices, and `r` is the amount of money available. It then reads two lists: `s` (buying prices) and `b` (selling prices). If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial amount `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total amount of money that can be obtained by selling those shares at the maximum selling price, which it then prints. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results based on the conditions.
