Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers and `b` is a list of integers from new input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, computes `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` when divided by `min_buy_price`, and calculates `total_bourles` as `max_shares` multiplied by `max_sell_price` plus `remaining_bourles`, then prints `total_bourles`. This covers the scenario where the input values lead to no shares being bought (if `r` is less than `min_buy_price`), ensuring all edge cases regarding the relationship between buying and selling prices are addressed.***
