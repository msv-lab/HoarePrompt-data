The value of `max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `min_buy_price` remain unchanged. The state of `max_sell_price` will depend on the values present in list `b`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new variable `max_sell_price`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of integers from input; `b` is a list of integers from new input; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`.**
