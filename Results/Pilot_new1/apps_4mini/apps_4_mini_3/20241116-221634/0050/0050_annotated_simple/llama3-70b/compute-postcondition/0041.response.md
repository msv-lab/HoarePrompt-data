Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `s`, `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is 0 or less, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
