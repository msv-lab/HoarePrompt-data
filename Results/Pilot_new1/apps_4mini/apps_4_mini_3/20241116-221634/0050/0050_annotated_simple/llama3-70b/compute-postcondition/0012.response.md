Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, and `shares` is updated to `r // s[i]` if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, with `r` being updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks, leaving `shares` equal to 0 and `r` unchanged.***
