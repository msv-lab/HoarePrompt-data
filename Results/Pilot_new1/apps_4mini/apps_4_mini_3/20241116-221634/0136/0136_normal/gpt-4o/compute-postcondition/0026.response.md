The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, and each string can have up to \(10^6\) digits. After executing the function body, it processes these string representations of non-negative integers and returns the result based on their values. The specific output behavior is not provided, but the function is designed to handle large integers represented as strings. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and processes these strings to return a result based on their values.**
