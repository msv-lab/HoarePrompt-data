The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. The previous value of `b` was an empty string, so it is now updated. The variable `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0'.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, and if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'; `b` is '0'**
