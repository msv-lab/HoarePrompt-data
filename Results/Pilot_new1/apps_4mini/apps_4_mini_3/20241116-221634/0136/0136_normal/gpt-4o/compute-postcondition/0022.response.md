Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are string representations of numbers with leading zeros removed. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the output is '='. Both strings have the same length, `b` is non-empty, and if either string is empty, it is set to '0'.***
