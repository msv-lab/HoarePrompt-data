The code takes input from the user, which is expected to be a single line containing two non-negative integers represented as strings. The `split()` method will divide this input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace. 

Since `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, after executing the code, `data` will be assigned a list containing these two strings. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly modified or assigned in this snippet; they will be contained within the `data` list. 

Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, and `data` is a list containing the two input strings.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, and `data` is a list containing the two input strings.**
