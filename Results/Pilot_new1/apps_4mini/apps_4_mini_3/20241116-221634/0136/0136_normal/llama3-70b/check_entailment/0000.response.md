The provided Python program reads two very long integers as input, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the two strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if the first string is greater.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Leading Zero Handling**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeroes from both numbers. This is correct as it allows for accurate comparisons without the influence of leading zeroes.
2. **Lexicographical Comparison**: The program compares the two strings after removing leading zeroes. This is valid because, after leading zeroes are stripped, the strings can be compared directly.
3. **Output Cases**: The program handles three cases: equality, less than, and greater than, which aligns with the problem description.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Both Numbers as Zero**: If both inputs are '0', after stripping leading zeroes, they will both become empty strings, leading to a comparison of two empty strings. This will result in an output of '=', which is correct.
2. **Single Leading Zero**: Inputs like '0' and '0000' will both become empty strings after stripping, leading to equality, which is correct.
3. **Very Large Numbers**: The program does not have any explicit limitations for very large numbers, but Python's string comparison is capable of handling strings of length up to `10^6` without issues, as long as they are read correctly.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints state that the function accepts two non-negative integers as input strings, removes leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. They also mention that it prints the correct symbols based on the comparison. This aligns with the program's functionality.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code against the problem description and considering the edge cases, it appears that the program correctly handles all specified scenarios, including leading zeroes and large integers. The output hints also accurately describe the function's behavior.

Correctness: **True**.
