The code prints the string '<'. The values of the variables `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation, and the output is simply the printed character. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the variable values, but the print statement indicates a comparison result.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the new input string with leading zeroes removed, `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, with `a` and `b` not being equal, and the output is '<'**
