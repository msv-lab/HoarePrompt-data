The code `print('=')` outputs a string consisting of a single equal sign. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify their values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` is equal to `b` and includes the printed output.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the new input string with leading zeroes removed, `a` is equal to `b`, and the output is '='**
