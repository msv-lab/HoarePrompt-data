The code executes a print statement that outputs the string '='. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged in their values. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a` and `b`, along with the output of the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros, and the output is '='**
