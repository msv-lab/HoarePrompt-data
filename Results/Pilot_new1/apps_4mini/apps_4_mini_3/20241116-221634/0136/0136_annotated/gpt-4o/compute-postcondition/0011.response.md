Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0'. `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If `b` is empty, it is set to '0', otherwise it retains its original value from `data[1]`.***
