You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

Annotated Program:
```
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros; if `a` is empty, it is set to '0'. `b` remains as `data[1]` without leading zeros, and `data` is a list containing the two strings.
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0'. If `b` is empty, it is set to '0', making `data[1]` equal to '0' without leading zeros. If `b` is not empty, it retains its original value from `data[1]`, which also does not have leading zeros.
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
                #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros, the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'; otherwise, it prints '='. Additionally, if `b` was empty, it is treated as '0' in the comparisons.
            #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros, and their lengths are equal. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. Additionally, if `b` was initially empty, it is treated as '0' in the comparisons, ensuring that all cases are accounted for based on the relative values of `a` and `b`.
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', and `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the output is '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. Additionally, if `b` was initially empty, it is treated as '0' in the comparisons, ensuring that all cases are accounted for based on the relative values of `a` and `b`.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', and `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0' (if originally empty). If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This ensures that all cases, including when `b` is empty, are accounted for in the comparisons.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts two non-negative integers as strings, processes them by stripping leading zeros, and compares their values. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it is treated as '0'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
