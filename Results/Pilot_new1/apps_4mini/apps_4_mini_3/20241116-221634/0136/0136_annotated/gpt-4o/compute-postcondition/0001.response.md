The code assigns `a` the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is initially a non-negative integer represented as a string, the value of `a` will be the same as `data[0]`, but without any leading zeros. If `data[0]` is "000123", `a` will be "123". If `data[0]` is "0", `a` will be an empty string. The value of `b` and the list `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `data` is a list containing the two strings**
