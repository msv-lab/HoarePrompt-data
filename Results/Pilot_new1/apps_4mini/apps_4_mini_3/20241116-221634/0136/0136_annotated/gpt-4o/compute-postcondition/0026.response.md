The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing no more than 10^6 digits, and may include leading zeroes. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the provided constraints. However, since the specific output behavior of the function is not detailed, we cannot specify the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both non-negative integers represented as strings, and processes them according to the defined logic.**
