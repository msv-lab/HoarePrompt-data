Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', and `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0' (if originally empty). If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the output is '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This ensures that all cases, including when `b` is empty, are accounted for in the comparisons.***
