Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representing a number without leading zeros or is '0', `b` is a string representing a number without leading zeros, the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'; otherwise, it prints '='. Additionally, if `b` was empty, it is treated as '0' in the comparisons.***
