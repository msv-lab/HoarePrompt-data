The variable `data` is assigned the value of the input split by whitespace. The input consists of two non-negative integers represented as strings, which may include leading zeroes. The values of `a` and `b` are not modified by this code, but `data` will contain the two strings derived from the input. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, and `data` is a list containing those two strings.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, and `data` is a list containing those two strings**
