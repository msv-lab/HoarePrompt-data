The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros using `lstrip('0')`. The initial state indicates that `a` is `data[0]` without leading zeros, and `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. The operation will not affect `a` or `data`, and the value of `b` will depend on the original value of `data[1]`. 

If `data[1]` originally has leading zeros, they will be removed; if it has no leading zeros, `b` will remain the same. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `b` after the leading zeros have been stripped.

Output State: **`a` is `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is `data[1]` without leading zeros, `data` is a list containing the two strings**
