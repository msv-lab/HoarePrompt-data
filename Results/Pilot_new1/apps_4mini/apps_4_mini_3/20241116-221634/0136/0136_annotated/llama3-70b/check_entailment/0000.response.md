To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and its annotations in detail.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to compare two non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes. The program must:
1. Read two integers as strings.
2. Remove any leading zeroes.
3. Compare the two integers:
   - Print `<` if the first integer is less than the second.
   - Print `>` if the first integer is greater than the second.
   - Print `=` if both integers are equal.

### Code Analysis
The provided code does the following:
1. Reads two lines of input and removes leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`.
2. Compares the two strings lexicographically:
   - If they are equal, it prints `=`.
   - If the first string is less than the second, it prints `<`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `>`.

### Annotations Review
The annotations state the following:
- After removing leading zeroes, the program compares the two strings.
- It correctly identifies equality and lexicographical ordering.
- The program prints the appropriate symbols based on the comparison.

### Edge Cases
1. **Leading Zero Handling**: The program correctly removes leading zeroes, which is crucial for proper integer comparison.
2. **Empty Input**: If both inputs are empty, the program will treat them as `''` after `lstrip('0')`, leading to an equality check that prints `=`.
3. **Single Digit Comparisons**: The program handles cases like `0` vs. `0`, which will correctly print `=`.
4. **Different Lengths**: The lexicographical comparison works correctly due to the nature of string comparison in Python, which respects length (e.g., `000123` vs. `123` will yield `=`).

### Potential Issues
While the program appears to handle typical cases well, we need to consider:
- **All Zero Input**: Input like `0000` vs. `0` will be handled correctly, outputting `=`.
- **Very Large Numbers**: The program can handle numbers up to `10^6` digits, as it processes them as strings without converting to integers.

### Conclusion
After careful consideration of the problem description and the code:
- The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description.
- It handles leading zeroes, equality, and lexicographical comparisons correctly.

Since I cannot find any input case where the program fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
