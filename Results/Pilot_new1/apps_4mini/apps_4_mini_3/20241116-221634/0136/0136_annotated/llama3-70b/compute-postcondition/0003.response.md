The code prints the character `'='`. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string after removing leading zeroes, and `a` is equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string after removing leading zeroes, and `a` is equal to `b**
