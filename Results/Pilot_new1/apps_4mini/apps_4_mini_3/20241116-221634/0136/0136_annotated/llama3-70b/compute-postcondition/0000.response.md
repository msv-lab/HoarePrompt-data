The value of `a` is assigned the result of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes in the input string will be removed. Since `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, after this operation, `a` will either be an empty string (if the input was all zeroes) or a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeroes. The variable `b` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is unchanged**
