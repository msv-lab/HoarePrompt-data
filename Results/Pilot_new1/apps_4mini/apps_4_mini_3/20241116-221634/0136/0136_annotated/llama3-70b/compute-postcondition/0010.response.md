Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string without leading zeroes and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output is '='. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, the output is '>'.***
