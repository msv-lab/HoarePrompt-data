To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we will analyze the code step by step and ensure that it accurately implements the requirements of the problem description.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    a = data[0].lstrip('0')
    b = data[1].lstrip('0')
    if (not a) :
        a = '0'
    if (not b) :
        b = '0'
    if (len(a) < len(b)) :
        print('<')
    else :
        if (len(a) > len(b)) :
            print('>')
        else :
            if (a < b) :
                print('<')
            else :
                if (a > b) :
                    print('>')
                else :
                    print('=')
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input and splits it into two parts: `a` and `b`.
   - It removes leading zeroes from both `a` and `b` using `lstrip('0')`.

2. **Handling Empty Strings**:
   - If `a` is empty after removing leading zeroes (which means it was all zeroes), it is set to '0'.
   - The same logic is applied to `b`.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`:
     - If `len(a) < len(b)`, it prints `<`.
     - If `len(a) > len(b)`, it prints `>`.
   - If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of `a` and `b` lexicographically:
     - If `a < b`, it prints `<`.
     - If `a > b`, it prints `>`.
     - If they are equal, it prints `=`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Leading Zeroes**: The program correctly handles inputs like `000123` and `123` by stripping leading zeroes.
2. **Equal Values**: For inputs like `0000` and `0`, both should yield `=`.
3. **All Zeroes**: Inputs like `000` and `00` should also yield `=`.
4. **Single Digit Comparisons**: Inputs like `0` and `1` should yield `<`, and vice versa.

### Testing Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: Input `000000` and `0` should output `=`.
- **Case 2**: Input `000123` and `123` should output `=`.
- **Case 3**: Input `000` and `000` should output `=`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases according to the problem description. It successfully compares two very long integers represented as strings, accounting for leading zeroes and ensuring that the output adheres to the required format.

Thus, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
