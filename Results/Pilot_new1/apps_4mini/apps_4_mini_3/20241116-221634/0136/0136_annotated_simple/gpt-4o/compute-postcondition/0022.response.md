Postcondition: ***`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, which can be '0' if it was originally an empty string. `b` retains its original value without leading zeroes or is set to '0' if it was an empty string. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, and if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the output is '='.***
