Postcondition: ***`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, which can be '0' if it was originally an empty string; `b` retains its original value without leading zeroes or is set to '0' if it was an empty string; the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; and `a` is less than `b`.***
