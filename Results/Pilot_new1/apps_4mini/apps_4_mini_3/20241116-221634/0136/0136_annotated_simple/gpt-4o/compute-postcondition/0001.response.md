The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed using `lstrip('0')`. Since `a` is represented as a string that may contain leading zeroes, the new value of `a` will be the same as `data[0]` but without any leading zeroes. The variable `b` and the list `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a` after removing leading zeroes.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list containing the split input values of `a` and `b`.**
