The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. The initial state specifies that `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list containing the split input values of `a` and `b`. The value of `data[1]` will determine the new value of `b`. If `data[1]` is "000123", then `b` will be "123". If `data[1]` is "0", then `b` will be an empty string. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `b` based on the original value of `data[1]` and the fact that `a` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is the value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes; `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes**
