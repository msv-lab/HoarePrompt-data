The provided program reads two long integers `a` and `b`, removes any leading zeros, and then compares the two numbers to print the appropriate symbol based on their relationship.

Let's analyze the code and the comments:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` to read the two integers, which is acceptable in Python 3. However, the problem description mentions using `raw_input()` in Python 2, which is not relevant here since we are considering the code in Python 3.

2. **Leading Zeros**: The program correctly removes leading zeros using `lstrip('0')`. This is important to ensure that comparisons are accurate.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - The program first checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints `=`.
   - If they are not equal, it checks if `a` is less than `b` and prints `<` if true, otherwise it prints `>`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where both numbers are equal after leading zeros are stripped.
   - It also correctly handles cases where one number is greater than the other.

However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the input. If both `a` and `b` are "0" (or contain only zeros), the program will strip all zeros and compare empty strings, which will lead to incorrect behavior. The comparison of two empty strings would be considered equal, but the output should indicate that both numbers are equal to zero.

**Example of failure**: 
If the input is:
```
0000
0000
```
The program would strip leading zeros and compare two empty strings, resulting in an output of `=`. However, this is a valid case where both numbers are equal to zero.

Thus, the program fails to handle the case when both inputs are all zeros correctly.

Correctness: **False**
