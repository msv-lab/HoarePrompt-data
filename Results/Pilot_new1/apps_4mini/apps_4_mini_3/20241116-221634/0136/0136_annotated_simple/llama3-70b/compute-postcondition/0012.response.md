Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings `a` and `b`, which represent non-negative integers. It compares these integers after stripping any leading zeroes and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input may be empty or non-numeric, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. **
