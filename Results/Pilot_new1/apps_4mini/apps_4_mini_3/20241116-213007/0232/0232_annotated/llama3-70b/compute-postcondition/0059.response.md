Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` with a value of `0` if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`. Additionally, `found` remains False, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `0`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
