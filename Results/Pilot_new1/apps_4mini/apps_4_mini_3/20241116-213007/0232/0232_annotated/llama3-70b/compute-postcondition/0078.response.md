The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The values of `window_counts`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, as this assignment does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j`; and `found` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j`; `found` is set to `True**
