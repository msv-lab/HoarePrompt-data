The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `found` is True; `i` is n; `j` is n; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
