The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the key `color` with its corresponding value; `found` is True; `i` is `n - 1`; `n` is greater than 0; `j` is `n - 1`; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`; and all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
