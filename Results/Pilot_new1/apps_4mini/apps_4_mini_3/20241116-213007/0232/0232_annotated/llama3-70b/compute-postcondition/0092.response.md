Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` with a value of 0 if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`. `found` remains False, `i` is n - 1, `j` is n - 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
