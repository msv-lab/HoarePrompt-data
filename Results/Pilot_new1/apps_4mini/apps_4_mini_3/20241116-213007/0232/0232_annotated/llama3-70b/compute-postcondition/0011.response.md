Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `color_counts` is updated to ensure that if `color` (the second color in the list `colors`, which contains at least 2 colors) is not already a key, it is initialized to 0. If `color` was not previously in `color_counts`, it is now set to 0; otherwise, `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
