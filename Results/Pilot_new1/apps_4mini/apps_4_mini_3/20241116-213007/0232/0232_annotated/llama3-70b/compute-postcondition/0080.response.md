Postcondition: ***`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j`. If all counts in `window_counts` sorted are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues execution without breaking.***
