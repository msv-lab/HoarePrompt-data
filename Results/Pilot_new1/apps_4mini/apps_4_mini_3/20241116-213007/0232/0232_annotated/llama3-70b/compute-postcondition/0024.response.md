Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `found` is set to False, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is 0, `color` is assigned from `colors[0]`, and `color` is not a key in `window_counts`.***
