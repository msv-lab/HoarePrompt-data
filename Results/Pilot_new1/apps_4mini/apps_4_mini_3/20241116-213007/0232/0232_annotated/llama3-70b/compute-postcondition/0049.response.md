Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to but not including `n`. If at any point the sorted values of `window_counts` match the values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop exits; otherwise, `found` remains False. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty and `found` remains False.**
