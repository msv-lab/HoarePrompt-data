The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 2; `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` equal to `i` and `n` greater than `j`; `found` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
