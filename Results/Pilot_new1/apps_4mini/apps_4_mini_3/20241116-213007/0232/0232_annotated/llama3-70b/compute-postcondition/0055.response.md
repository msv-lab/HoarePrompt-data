According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `i` (which is `n - 1`) is less than `n`, meaning `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to run. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be equal to `n - 1` if the loop executes at least once. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, and `j` should start at `n - 1`.

State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `0`, `j` is `n - 1`**
