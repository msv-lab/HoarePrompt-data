Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the elements in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. Otherwise, `found` remains False.***
