The statement `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value of `0` to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` was `1`. Other variables such as `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 0, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is greater than `j`.

Output State: **`window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 0, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is greater than `j`.**
