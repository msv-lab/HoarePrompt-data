The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from input, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is now True, and we break out of the most internal loop.
