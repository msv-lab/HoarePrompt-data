The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the counts of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` up to but not including `n`, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
