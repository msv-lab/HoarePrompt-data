The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input values (which are split into separate strings) to integers. The input is expected to be a list of integers, and since `colors` is a list of integers from input, the values in `counts` will reflect the integers entered by the user. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n` and `m`, along with the new list `counts`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `counts` is a list of integers from input**
