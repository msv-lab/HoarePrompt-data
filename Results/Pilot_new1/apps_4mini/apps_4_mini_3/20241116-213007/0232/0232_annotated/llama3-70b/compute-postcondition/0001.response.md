The variable `colors` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. The input will provide a series of integers, which will be converted to integers and stored in the list `colors`. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of `n` and `m`, along with the new list `colors` that contains the input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `colors` is a list of integers from input**
