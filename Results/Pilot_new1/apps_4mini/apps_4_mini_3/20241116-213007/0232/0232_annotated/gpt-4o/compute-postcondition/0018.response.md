According to the code, the loop's ability to execute depends on the variable `right` and the upper limit `n`. The loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is equal to `n`, which means the loop cannot execute again unless `right` is incremented to `n + 1` for the next iteration. 

Since `right` is already at `n`, the only adjustment needed is to indicate that `right` can be considered for the next iteration. Therefore, `right` should be adjusted to `n + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted as they are not directly related to the loop's execution.

State: **`left` is the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` is updated at index `colors[n]` by 1, `right` is n + 1**
