Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ sum(`k`) ≤ `n`, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the corresponding values in `k`. If the counts of each color in `current_counts` match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, the function does not return anything. This condition accounts for all possible distributions of colors and their counts within the specified ranges.***
