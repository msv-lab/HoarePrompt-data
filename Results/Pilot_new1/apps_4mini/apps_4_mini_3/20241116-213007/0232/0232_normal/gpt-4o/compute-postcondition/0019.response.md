The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The specific values of `left`, `right`, and `current_counts` are not provided, but the operation affects only `current_counts`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been increased by 1.

Output State: **`left` is at its current value, `right` is n, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1**
