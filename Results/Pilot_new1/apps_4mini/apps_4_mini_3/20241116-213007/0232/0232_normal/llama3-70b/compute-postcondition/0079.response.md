The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `window_counts` is updated with `color` having a value of 1, `found` is True, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n - 1`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
