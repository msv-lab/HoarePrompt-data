Output State: **If `colors` is non-empty, `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from `colors` starting at index `i` up to `n`, `found` is True if the counts match the target counts, otherwise it remains False. If `colors` is empty, the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, and `i`, `n`, and `color_counts` remain unchanged. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and `window_counts` remains empty, `found` is False, and `color_counts`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.**
