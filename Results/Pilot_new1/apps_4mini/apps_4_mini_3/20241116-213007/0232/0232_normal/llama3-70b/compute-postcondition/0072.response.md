Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` added with a value of 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. In all other cases, `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.***
