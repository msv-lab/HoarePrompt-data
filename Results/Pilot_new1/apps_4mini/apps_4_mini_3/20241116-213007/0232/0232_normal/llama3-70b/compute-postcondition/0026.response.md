Postcondition: ***`colors` is a non-empty list or empty; if `colors` is non-empty, `color` is the first element of `colors`, and if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `colors` is empty, `color` is an error. The dictionary `window_counts` may or may not have `color` as a key, but if it does not, it has been initialized with `color` as a key and a corresponding value of 0. The values of `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, with `found` being False, `i` being 0, `n` being greater than 0, and `j` being 0.***
