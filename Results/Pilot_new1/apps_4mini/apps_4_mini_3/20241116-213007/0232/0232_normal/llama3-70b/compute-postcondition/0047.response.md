Postcondition: ***`colors` is non-empty, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the counts of elements in `window_counts` match the target counts, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, the state of `found` remains unchanged, and the loop continues.***
