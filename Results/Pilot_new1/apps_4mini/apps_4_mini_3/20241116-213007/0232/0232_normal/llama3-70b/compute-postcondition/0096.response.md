The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` has the key `color` with a value of either `1` or incremented by `1`; `found` is True; `color_counts` remains unchanged; `i` is `n-1`; `n` is greater than `n-1`; `j` is `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
