Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` with a value of `0` if `color` was not previously present in `window_counts`. The variable `found` remains False, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, and `j` is `n-1`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
