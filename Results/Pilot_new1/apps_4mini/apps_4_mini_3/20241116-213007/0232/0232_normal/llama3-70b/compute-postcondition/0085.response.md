Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that counts occurrences of colors from the `colors` list starting from index `i` (which is `n-1`) to `n`. If `found` is True, it indicates that the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, and the loop is exited. If `n` is equal to or less than `n-1`, the loop does not execute, leaving `window_counts` empty, `found` as False, `color_counts` unchanged, and both `i` and `j` as `n-1` (if `n` is greater than `n-1`) or undefined (if `n` is not greater than `n-1`).***
