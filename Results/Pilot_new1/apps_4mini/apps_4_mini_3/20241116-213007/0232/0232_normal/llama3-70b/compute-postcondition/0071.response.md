The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` added with a value of 1; `found` is True, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `j` is `n`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
