The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. The `input()` function will accept a space-separated string of integers, which are then converted to integers and stored in the list `colors`. The values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected by this line of code, but they define the constraints for the input. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `colors` is a list of integers from user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, and `colors` is a list of integers from user input**
