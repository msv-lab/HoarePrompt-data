The value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not previously in `window_counts`, it was initialized to 0, so it will now be 1. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its previous count is increased by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is non-empty, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`colors` is non-empty, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1.**
