The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is non-empty, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `j` is `i + 1`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
