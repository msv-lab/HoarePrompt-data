Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑(k[i]) ≤ n, and `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to `m` to the values in `k`. If the current counts of colors match the desired counts for all colors in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it does not return anything.***
