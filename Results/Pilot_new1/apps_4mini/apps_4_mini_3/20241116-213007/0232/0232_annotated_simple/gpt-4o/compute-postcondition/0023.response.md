The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq n\).
- `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \{1, 2, ..., m\}.
- `k` is a list of `m` integers where \(1 \leq \sum(k[i]) \leq n\).

The functionality of the function is as follows:

- If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]` for any color at the start), the function will not return anything, and `left` and `right` will remain 0.
- If the loop executes and finds a valid segment where all `current_counts[color]` equal `desired_counts[color]`, the function will return 'YES' immediately.
- If no such segment is found by the end of the loop, the function will return 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`, and returns 'YES' if a valid segment is found where all color counts match the desired counts; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
