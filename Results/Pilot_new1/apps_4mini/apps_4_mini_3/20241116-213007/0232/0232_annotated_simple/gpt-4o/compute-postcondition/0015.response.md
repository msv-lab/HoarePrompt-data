Output State: **If all `current_counts[color]` equal their corresponding `desired_counts[color]` for every color in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES' and `left` and `right` remain unchanged. If at least one `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]`, the loop continues until `left` is incremented, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented. If `left` reaches `n` without finding a match, the loop terminates. If `current_counts` never meets `desired_counts`, the function does not return anything. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if at the start, `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]` for any color), `left` and `right` remain 0 and the function does not return anything.**
