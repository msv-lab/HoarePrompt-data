The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created from input where the input is split into individual strings, converted to integers, and then collected into a list. The initial state specifies that `colors` is a list of `n` integers, and the input will provide those integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not changed by this line of code, and the values in `colors` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state will mention that `colors` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of `n` integers based on input; `counts` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ ∑(k_i) ≤ `n`**
