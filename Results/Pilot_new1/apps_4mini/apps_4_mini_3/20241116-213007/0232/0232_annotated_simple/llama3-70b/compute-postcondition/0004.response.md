According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `colors` list. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, this means that the `colors` list must contain at least one integer (specifically, `n` integers). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `colors` must be a non-empty list of integers. 

At the beginning of the loop, `color` will take on the value of the first element in the `colors` list. Thus, we need to ensure that `color` is initialized to the first element of `colors`, and the `colors` list must contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, `color` is the first element in the `colors` list**
