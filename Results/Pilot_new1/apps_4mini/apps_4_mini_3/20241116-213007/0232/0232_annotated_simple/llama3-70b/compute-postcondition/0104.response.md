The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.
