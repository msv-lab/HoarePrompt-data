Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, and `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding sorted values in `counts`. If they match, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, no changes are made to `found`, `window_counts`, `i`, or `j`.***
