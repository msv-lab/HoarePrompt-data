Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, the loop is exited, indicating that the required counts have been found; otherwise, the loop continues without any changes to `found` or the other variables.***
