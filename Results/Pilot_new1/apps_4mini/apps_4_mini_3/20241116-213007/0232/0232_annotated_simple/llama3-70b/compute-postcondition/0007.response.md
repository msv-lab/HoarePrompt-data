Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a non-empty list of `n` integers, and `color` is the first element in the `colors` list. If `color` is not present in `color_counts`, it will be added with a count of 0. If `color` is already in `color_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
