Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `found` remains unchanged, and if `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0; otherwise, `window_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
