The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `found` is set to True, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
