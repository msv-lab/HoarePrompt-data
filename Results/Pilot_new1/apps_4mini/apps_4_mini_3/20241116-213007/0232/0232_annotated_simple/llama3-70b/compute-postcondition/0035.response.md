Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of colors; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `found` is set to True if the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding sorted values in `counts`; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `color` is the second element of `colors`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
