The code executes a print statement that outputs a single hyphen ('-'). The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding `max_upvotes` and `min_downvotes` are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, and `z`, along with the printed output.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are integers based on user input, and a hyphen '-' is printed**
