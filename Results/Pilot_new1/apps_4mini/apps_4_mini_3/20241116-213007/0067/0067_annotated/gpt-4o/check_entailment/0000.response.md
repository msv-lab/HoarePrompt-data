To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code and the examples provided.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. There are three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes in all scenarios.
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes in all scenarios.
   - "0" if upvotes and downvotes are equal in all scenarios.
   - "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes due to the unknown votes.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
The program reads `x`, `y`, and `z`, and calculates:
- `min_upvotes = x`
- `max_upvotes = x + z`
- `min_downvotes = y`
- `max_downvotes = y + z`

Then it checks:
1. If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `'-'`.
2. If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `'+'`.
3. Otherwise, it prints `'?'`.

### Analysis of Cases:
- **Case 1**: If `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`:
  - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 7` → Outputs `'-'` (correct).
  
- **Case 2**: If `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:
  - `max_upvotes = 3`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Outputs `'+'` (correct).

- **Case 3**: If `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`:
  - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 1` → Outputs `'0'` (correct).

- **Case 4**: If `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:
  - `max_upvotes = 1`, `min_downvotes = 0` → Outputs `'?'` (correct).

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case with maximum values**: If `x = 100`, `y = 100`, `z = 100`:
   - `max_upvotes = 200`, `min_downvotes = 100` → Outputs `'+'` (correct).

2. **Case with minimum values**: If `x = 0`, `y = 100`, `z = 0`:
   - `max_upvotes = 0`, `min_downvotes = 100` → Outputs `'-'` (correct).

3. **Case with equal votes and unknowns**: If `x = 50`, `y = 50`, `z = 1`:
   - `max_upvotes = 51`, `min_downvotes = 50` → Outputs `'?'` (correct, as the outcome can vary).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as per the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. The annotations provided in the code accurately describe the logic and the expected behavior of the program.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
