To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. We have three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output can be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes are equal to downvotes and there are no unknown votes.
   - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the presence of unknown votes or if the votes are equal with unknown votes present.

### Annotations Overview:
The annotations summarize the logic of the code:
- If `x > y + z`, it prints "+".
- If `x < y`, it prints "-".
- If `x == y`, it checks if `z` is 0:
  - If `z == 0`, it prints "0".
  - If `z > 0`, it prints "?".
- If `x >= y` but not equal, it prints "?".

### Analysis of the Code Logic:
1. **Case 1**: `x > y + z`
   - This means that even if all unknown votes were downvotes, upvotes would still exceed downvotes. The output is "+".
   
2. **Case 2**: `x < y`
   - This means downvotes exceed upvotes regardless of unknown votes. The output is "-".
   
3. **Case 3**: `x == y`
   - If `z == 0`, then the result is certain and it prints "0".
   - If `z > 0`, the outcome could be either "+" or "-", depending on how the unknown voters vote, leading to an uncertain result printed as "?".
   
4. **Case 4**: If `x >= y` but `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is "?" because there could still be cases where the unknown votes could change the outcome.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the edge cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided:
  - For input `(3, 7, 0)`, output is "-" (correct).
  - For input `(2, 0, 1)`, output is "+" (correct).
  - For input `(1, 1, 0)`, output is "0" (correct).
  - For input `(0, 0, 1)`, output is "?" (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program handles all specified cases correctly, according to the problem description. The logic in the code matches the requirements, and the annotations align with the operations performed in the code.

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly determines the outcome based on the provided inputs, ensuring it covers all potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.
