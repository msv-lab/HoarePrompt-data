The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Based on the output, it is implied that the function processes the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are integers constrained to the range 0 to 100. However, since there are no specific output conditions provided, we cannot determine the exact return values or behavior of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently undefined due to the lack of output specifications.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is currently undefined due to insufficient output specifications.**
