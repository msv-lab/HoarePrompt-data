The code executes a print statement that outputs a single character, which does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. Therefore, the output state reflects that the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the print statement has been executed.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. The value of `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` is less than `y`; and the character '-' has been printed.**
