The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new values based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` converts the input string into three integers. Since the previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, they will be replaced by the new input values. Therefore, the output state is that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on the input provided**
