The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `min_upvotes`, `max_upvotes`, and `min_downvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, and `max_downvotes` is `y + z`.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`**
