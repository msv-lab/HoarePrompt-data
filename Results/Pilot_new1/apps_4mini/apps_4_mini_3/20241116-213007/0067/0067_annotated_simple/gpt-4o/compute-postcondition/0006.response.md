The code executes a print statement that outputs a single hyphen ('-'). The values of the variables are not changed by this operation. The initial state of the variables remains intact. Therefore, the output state is: `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, and the output is a hyphen.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, and the output is '-'**
