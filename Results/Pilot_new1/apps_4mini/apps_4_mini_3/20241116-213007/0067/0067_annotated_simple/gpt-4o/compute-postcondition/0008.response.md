Postcondition: ***`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`, `max_downvotes` is `y + z`. The maximum downvotes, `max_downvotes`, is less than the minimum upvotes, `min_upvotes`, and the maximum upvotes, `max_upvotes`, is greater than or equal to the minimum downvotes, `min_downvotes` (i.e., `x + z >= y`).***
