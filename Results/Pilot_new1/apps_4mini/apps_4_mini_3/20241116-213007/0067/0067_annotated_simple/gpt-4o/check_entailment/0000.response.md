To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and the edge cases.

### Problem Analysis:
The program needs to determine the voting outcome based on three integers:
- `x`: number of known upvotes,
- `y`: number of known downvotes,
- `z`: number of unknown votes that could either be upvotes or downvotes.

The possible outcomes are:
1. If the minimum possible upvotes (which is `x`) is greater than the maximum possible downvotes (which is `y + z`), the result is "+".
2. If the maximum possible upvotes (which is `x + z`) is less than the minimum possible downvotes (which is `y`), the result is "-".
3. If neither of the above conditions hold, the result is uncertain ("?").

### Program Logic:
1. Calculate `min_upvotes` as `x`.
2. Calculate `max_upvotes` as `x + z`.
3. Calculate `min_downvotes` as `y`.
4. Calculate `max_downvotes` as `y + z`.

Then the program checks:
- If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, print "-".
- If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, print "+".
- Otherwise, print "?".

### Edge Cases:
Now let's consider some cases:
1. **Case with no votes (0, 0, 0)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 0`
   - Minimum upvotes = 0, Maximum upvotes = 0, Minimum downvotes = 0, Maximum downvotes = 0
   - Outcome: Since upvotes equal downvotes, the result should be "0". The program will output "?" which is incorrect.

2. **Case with one unknown vote (0, 0, 1)**:
   - `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`
   - Possible outcomes: If the unknown vote is an upvote, result is "+", if downvote, result is "-".
   - Outcome: The correct result should be "?", and the program will output "?" which is correct.

3. **Case with more upvotes than downvotes (3, 2, 0)**:
   - `x = 3`, `y = 2`, `z = 0`
   - Outcome: The result should be "+". The program will output "+", which is correct.

4. **Case with equal upvotes and downvotes (1, 1, 0)**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`
   - Outcome: The result should be "0". The program will output "0", which is correct.

5. **Case with maximum uncertainty (1, 3, 2)**:
   - `x = 1`, `y = 3`, `z = 2`
   - Possible outcomes: If both unknown votes are downvotes, result is "-", if both are upvotes, result is "+", hence the result is uncertain.
   - The program will output "?", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the case where all votes are zero (0, 0, 0) by outputting "?" instead of "0". Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
