The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous values of the affected variables are `x`, `y`, and `z`, but the specific values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are based on input and are not known. The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`.

Output State: **`min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, and `min_downvotes` is `y`**
