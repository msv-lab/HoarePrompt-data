The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. However, since there are no parameters specified in the function definition, the function likely retrieves these values from another source or context. The output of the function is not provided in the description, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates on three integers x, y, and z constrained between 0 and 100, but the return value is unspecified.**
