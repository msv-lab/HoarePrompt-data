The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on the input provided. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not known, as they are replaced by the new values from the `input` function. Therefore, the output state reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on the input split into three parts.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on input values**
