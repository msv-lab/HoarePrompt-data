The code assigns the values from the input to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes a space-separated string input, splits it into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and assigns them to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not specified, they can be any integers within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now assigned new integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned new integer values based on the input**
