The `print('?')` statement outputs the string `?` to the console. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions of the variables without any modifications.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. `x` is equal to `y`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `z` is not equal to 0.**
