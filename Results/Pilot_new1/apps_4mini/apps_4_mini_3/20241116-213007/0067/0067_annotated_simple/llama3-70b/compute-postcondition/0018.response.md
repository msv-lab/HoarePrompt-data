The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with three integer variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are constrained such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined due to the lack of output information. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
