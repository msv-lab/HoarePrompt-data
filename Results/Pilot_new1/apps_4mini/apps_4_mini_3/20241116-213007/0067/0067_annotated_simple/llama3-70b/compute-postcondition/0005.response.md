The code executes a print statement that outputs the character `'-'`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since the print operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state reflects that the variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers. `x` is less than `y`, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and the output is '-'**
