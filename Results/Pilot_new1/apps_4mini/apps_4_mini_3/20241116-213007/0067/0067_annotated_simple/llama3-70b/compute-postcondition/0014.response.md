The code executes a print statement which outputs the string `?`. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `x` is greater than `y`; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z**
