To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the code logic against all possible input scenarios.

The program reads three integers: `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively. The program then checks the following conditions:

1. If `x > y + z`, it prints `'+'` because even if all unknown votes were downvotes, upvotes would still outnumber downvotes.
2. If `x < y`, it prints `'-'` because upvotes are fewer than downvotes, and there are no unknown votes to change that outcome.
3. If `x == y`, it further checks:
   - If `z == 0`, it prints `'0'` because there are equal upvotes and downvotes with no unknown votes.
   - If `z > 0`, it prints `'?'` because the presence of unknown votes creates uncertainty in the outcome.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, it defaults to printing `'?'`, which accounts for the scenario where upvotes are greater than downvotes but not enough to guarantee a clear outcome due to unknown votes.

Now, let's analyze edge cases:

1. **Case (0, 0, 1)**: This case should return `'?'` because there is one unknown vote, which could either be an upvote or a downvote, making the result uncertain. The program correctly outputs `'?'` for this case.
2. **Case (3, 7, 0)**: This case should return `'-'` because there are more downvotes than upvotes, and no unknown votes to consider. The program correctly outputs `'-'`.
3. **Case (2, 0, 1)**: This case should return `'+'` because even if the unknown vote is a downvote, there are still more upvotes than downvotes. The program correctly outputs `'+'`.
4. **Case (1, 1, 0)**: This case should return `'0'` since upvotes equal downvotes and there are no unknown votes. The program correctly outputs `'0'`.

Now, let's check for any potential edge cases that might not be handled correctly:

- **Case (100, 100, 100)**: This case should return `'?'` because with 100 unknown votes, it's uncertain whether the outcome will favor upvotes or downvotes. The program outputs `'?'`, which is correct.
- **Case (100, 0, 0)**: This should return `'+'` because there are no downvotes. The program outputs `'+'`, which is correct.
- **Case (0, 100, 0)**: This should return `'-'` because there are no upvotes. The program outputs `'-'`, which is correct.

After analyzing all possible cases, including edge cases, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly according to the problem description. 

Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
