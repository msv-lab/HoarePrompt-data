The code assigns the value of `y + z` to `max_downvotes`. The previous values of `y` and `z` are within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, the value of `max_downvotes` will be the sum of `y` and `z`, which can range from 0 (if both y and z are 0) to 200 (if both y and z are at their maximum of 100). The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`x` is an integer within 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, `z` is an integer within 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200.**
