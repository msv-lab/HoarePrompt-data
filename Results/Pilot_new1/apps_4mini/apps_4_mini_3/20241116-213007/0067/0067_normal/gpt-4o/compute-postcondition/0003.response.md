`min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The value of `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, but its specific value is not provided. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an integer within 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, `z` is an integer within 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer within 0 to 100, `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `y` is an integer within 0 to 100, `z` is an integer within 0 to 100, `max_upvotes` is an integer within 0 to 200, and `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`**
