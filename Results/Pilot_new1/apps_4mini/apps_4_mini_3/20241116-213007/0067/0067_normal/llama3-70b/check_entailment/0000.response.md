To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the logic implemented in the code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to determine the voting outcome based on three integers:
- `x`: number of upvotes
- `y`: number of downvotes
- `z`: number of unknown votes

The outcomes can be:
- If upvotes are greater than downvotes plus unknown votes, return "+".
- If downvotes are greater than upvotes, return "-".
- If upvotes equal downvotes:
  - If there are no unknown votes (`z == 0`), return "0".
  - If there are unknown votes (`z > 0`), the result is uncertain, return "?".
- If upvotes are greater than downvotes but less than or equal to the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, the result is uncertain, return "?".

### Program Logic:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Analysis:
1. **When `x > y + z`:** The program correctly returns "+" as there are definitely more upvotes than downvotes.
2. **When `x < y`:** The program correctly returns "-" since downvotes are greater.
3. **When `x == y`:**
   - If `z == 0`, it correctly returns "0" as there are equal upvotes and downvotes with no unknown votes.
   - If `z > 0`, it correctly returns "?" indicating uncertainty because the unknown votes can tip the balance.
4. **When `x > y` but `x <= y + z`:** 
   - The program does not explicitly handle this case, but it falls into the last `else` clause, which returns "?" indicating uncertainty. This is correct because the unknown votes could lead to a situation where downvotes could equal or exceed upvotes.

### Edge Cases:
- **All votes zero (`0, 0, 0`)**: The program will return "?" since `x == y` and `z > 0` (in this case, `z` is also 0, but it still leads to uncertainty).
- **Only unknown votes (`0, 0, z > 0`)**: The program will also return "?" correctly.
- **Cases with maximum values (e.g., `100, 100, 100`)**: The program should return "?" since both upvotes and downvotes are equal, and there are unknown votes.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints summarize the program's logic accurately. Each condition in the hints aligns with the logic in the code, confirming that the code handles the cases as described.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
