The code prints the string '0'. The values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are not changed by the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers; `z` is equal to 0; `x` is equal to `y`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and the function prints '0'.
