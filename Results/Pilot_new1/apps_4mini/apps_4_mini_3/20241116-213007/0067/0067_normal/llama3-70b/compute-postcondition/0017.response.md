Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the program prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, it prints '0' if `z` is 0; otherwise, it prints '?'. If `x` is greater than `y` but less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '?'.***
