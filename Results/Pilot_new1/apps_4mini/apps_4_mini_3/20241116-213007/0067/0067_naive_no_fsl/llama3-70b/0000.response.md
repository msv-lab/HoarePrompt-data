Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, let's analyze the logic for the case when `x + z` is equal to `y`. 

For example, consider the input `(0, 0, 1)`. According to the problem description, if there is one unknown voter (`z = 1`), the result could be uncertain because the unknown voter could either upvote or downvote. Thus, the possible outcomes would be either "+" (if the unknown votes up) or "-" (if the unknown votes down). The expected output should be "?".

However, in the provided program, the condition `elif x < y:` will evaluate to `False` because `x` (0) is not less than `y` (0), and it will move to the next condition, which is `elif x == y:`. In this condition, since `z` is not 0, it will output "?", which is correct for this case.

Now, consider the input `(2, 0, 1)`. Here, the result is clearly "+" since even if the unknown person votes down, there will still be more upvotes than downvotes. The output should be "+", which the program correctly identifies.

However, if we consider the input `(1, 0, 1)`, the possible outcomes are "+" (if the unknown votes up) or "-" (if the unknown votes down), resulting in uncertainty. The program will output "?", which is also correct.

There is a flaw in the program logic when both `x` and `y` are equal and `z` is greater than 0, as it fails to check if `x + z` could equal `y + z`, which would lead to uncertainty. 

Therefore, the program does not cover all scenarios correctly, especially when `x` and `y` are equal and `z` is greater than 0, leading to an uncertain situation that is not handled correctly in the logic. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.
