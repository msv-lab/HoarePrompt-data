The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect any other variables, and the previous values of `s`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
