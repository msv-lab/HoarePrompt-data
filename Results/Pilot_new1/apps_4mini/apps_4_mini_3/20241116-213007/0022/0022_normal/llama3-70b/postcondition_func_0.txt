The function reads a string input from the user and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing characters symmetrically from the start and end. If the string is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-English letters, but according to the problem constraints, it is expected that the input will be a valid string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.
