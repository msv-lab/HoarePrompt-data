Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if all corresponding characters from the start and end of the string `s` match for the first `n // 2` iterations; if any mismatch is found, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop exits early. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that a single character is always a palindrome. If `n` is 0 or negative (though not applicable given the constraints), the loop would not execute, and `is_spalindrome` would also remain True.**
