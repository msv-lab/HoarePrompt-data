According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which means that `n // 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` should be adjusted to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted since `s` remains a string of length between 1 and 1000 and `n` continues to be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1**
