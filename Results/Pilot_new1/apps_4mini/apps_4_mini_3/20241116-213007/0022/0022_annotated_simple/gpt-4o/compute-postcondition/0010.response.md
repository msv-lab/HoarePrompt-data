Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters are equal, the function does not return anything, implying that the check for these specific characters has passed.***
