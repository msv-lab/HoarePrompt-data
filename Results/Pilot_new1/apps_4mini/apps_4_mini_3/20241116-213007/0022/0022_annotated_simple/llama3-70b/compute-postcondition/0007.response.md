Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False, and the loop or statement is exited. If the first and last characters are equal, `is_palindrome` remains True, and the program continues to check the next characters in the string.***
