Output State: **`is_palindrome` is True if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, `is_palindrome` is False. The loop does not execute if `n` is less than 2, in which case `is_palindrome` remains True. If `n` is 2 or more, the loop checks pairs of characters from the start and end of the string moving towards the center. If any pair of characters do not match, `is_palindrome` is set to False and the loop exits. If all character pairs match, `is_palindrome` remains True after the loop completes.**
