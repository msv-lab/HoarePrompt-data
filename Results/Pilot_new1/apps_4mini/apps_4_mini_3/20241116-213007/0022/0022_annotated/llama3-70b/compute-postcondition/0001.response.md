The variable `n` is assigned the value `len(s)`, which calculates the length of the string `s` input by the user. The value of `s` is unchanged, and `n` will hold the integer value representing the number of characters in the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of that string.

Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of that string**
