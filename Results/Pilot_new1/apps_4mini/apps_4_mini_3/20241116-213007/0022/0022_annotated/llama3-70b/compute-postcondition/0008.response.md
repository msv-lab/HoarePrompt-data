According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value less than `n // 2`, and `n` is at least 2.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we note that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` is currently `k`, it should be adjusted to `k + 1`. 

Since `n` is at least 2, and `i` must be less than `n // 2`, we can conclude that after the adjustment, `i` will still be less than `n // 2` if `n` is at least 4. If `n` is exactly 2, then `i` would be 0, allowing for one more iteration before reaching 1, which is not less than `n // 2`.

Thus, we need to adjust `i` to `i + 1`.
