The value of `remainder` is calculated as `n % 10`, which gives the last digit of `n`. Since `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, it can take values from 0 to 5. The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. The value of `result` will therefore be `n` with its last digit removed, effectively rounding `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10.

The output state will reflect the values of `n`, `remainder`, and `result`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is `n % 10` and is less than or equal to 5; `result` is `n - remainder`**
