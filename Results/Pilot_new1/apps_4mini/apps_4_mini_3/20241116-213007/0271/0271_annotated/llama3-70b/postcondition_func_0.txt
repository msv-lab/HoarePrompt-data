The function accepts no parameters, prompts the user for a non-negative integer `n` within the range 0 to 10^9, and prints the nearest multiple of 10. If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.
