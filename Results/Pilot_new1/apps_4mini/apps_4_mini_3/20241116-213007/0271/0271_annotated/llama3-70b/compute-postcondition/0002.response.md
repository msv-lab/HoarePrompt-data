The code prints the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer that is a multiple of 10, its exact value is not specified but it remains unchanged. The output state reflects the value of `n` as it is printed. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is a multiple of 10**
