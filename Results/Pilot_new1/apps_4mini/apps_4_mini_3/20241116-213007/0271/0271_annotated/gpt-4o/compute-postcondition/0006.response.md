Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is set to `n - remainder`. If the remainder is greater than 5, then `result` is set to `n + (10 - remainder)`, which can result in values from `n + 1` to `n + 4`.***
