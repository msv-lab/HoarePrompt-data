The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints provided for a non-negative integer `n`, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since there are no specific output conditions or return values detailed in the prompt, we cannot determine the exact functionality or output of the function based solely on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is unclear without additional context regarding its output.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and its output is not specified.**
