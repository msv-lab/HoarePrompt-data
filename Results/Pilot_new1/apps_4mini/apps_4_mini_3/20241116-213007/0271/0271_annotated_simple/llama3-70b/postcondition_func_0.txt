The function accepts no parameters and prompts the user for a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9). It prints `n` if it is a multiple of 10. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`. The function handles edge cases such as `n` being 0 and `n` being 10^9 correctly, and it does not return any value.
