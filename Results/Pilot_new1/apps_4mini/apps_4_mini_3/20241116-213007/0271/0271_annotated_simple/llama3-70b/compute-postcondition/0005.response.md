The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which effectively rounds down `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. Given that `n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the output value will be `n - (remainder of n when divided by 10)`.

Since `n` is not a multiple of 10, the value of `n % 10` will be a number between 1 and 5, inclusive. Thus, `n - n % 10` will yield a number that is the largest multiple of 10 that is less than `n`.

The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input integer, and the result of the expression is `n - n % 10`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer; the result is `n - n % 10`**
