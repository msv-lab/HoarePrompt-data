The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and it returns True if `sub` is found in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` matches a variable `n_len`. However, the code references `n_len` without it being defined within the function, which will lead to a NameError. Therefore, the function does not operate correctly as intended.
