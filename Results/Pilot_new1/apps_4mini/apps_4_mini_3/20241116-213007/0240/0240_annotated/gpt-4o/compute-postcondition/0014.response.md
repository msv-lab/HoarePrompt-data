Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the current permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to the string formed by joining `perm`. The loop generates all permutations of `chars` and yields those that are valid numbers according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`. If `chars` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded. If `chars` contains only one character, the loop executes once, yielding `candidate` if it is valid or yielding nothing if it is not.**
