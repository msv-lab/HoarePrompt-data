According to the code, the loop executes over permutations of the string `chars`. For the loop to execute, `chars` must contain at least one character since permutations of an empty string would yield no results. Given that `chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it is guaranteed to have at least one character. 

At the start of the loop, `perm` will represent the first permutation of `chars`. Since `chars` can be any string of digits, we need to ensure that `perm` is initialized to the first permutation of the characters in `chars`. 

Thus, to summarize:
- `chars` must contain at least one character (which it does).
- `perm` can be initialized to the first permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
