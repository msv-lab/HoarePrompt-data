The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `sub`, both consisting of digits. It counts the occurrences of each character in `s` and `sub`, then decrements the counts in `s` based on those in `sub`. It constructs a string of remaining characters from `s`, generates possible numbers from these characters, and returns the smallest number from that list. However, if `sub` contains characters not present in `s`, this may result in negative counts in `s_counter`, which could lead to incorrect results in generating possible numbers. Additionally, if no valid numbers can be generated, this could raise an error when trying to find the minimum.
