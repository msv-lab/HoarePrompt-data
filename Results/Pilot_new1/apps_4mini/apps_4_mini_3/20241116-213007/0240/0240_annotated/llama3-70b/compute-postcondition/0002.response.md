According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will iterate over each character in the string. Since `s` is stated to be a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, it can be empty or contain digits. 

For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character (a digit). The variable `c` will take on the value of the first character in `s` during the first iteration. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute, `s` must not be an empty string, `c` must be the first character of `s`, and `n` remains an empty string as it is not affected by the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, `n` is an empty string**
