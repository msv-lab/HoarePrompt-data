Output State: **`n` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters from `s` that are present in `t_set`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute and `n` remains an empty string. If none of the characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` will also be an empty string. If `s` contains characters that are in `t_set`, `n` will contain those characters in the order they appear in `s`.**
