The variable `n` is assigned an empty string `''`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.

Output State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string**
