The function accepts a string `s` and a string `t`, constructs a new string `n` by including characters from `s` that are also present in `t`, and then appends `t` to `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of `n`. If `s` is empty or contains no characters found in `t`, and `t` is non-empty, the function will return the integer value of `t`. If both `s` and `t` are empty, the function will return 0.
