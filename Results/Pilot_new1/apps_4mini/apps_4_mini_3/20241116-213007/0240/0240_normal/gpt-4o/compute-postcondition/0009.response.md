According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `chars` variable. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the string `chars`. Since `perm` is currently the second permutation of `chars`, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence.

Given that `perm` is the second permutation, to ensure the loop continues, we need to update `perm` to the third permutation of `chars`. The `chars` variable does not need to be adjusted, as it remains constant throughout the loop.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `perm` should be updated to the third permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`**
