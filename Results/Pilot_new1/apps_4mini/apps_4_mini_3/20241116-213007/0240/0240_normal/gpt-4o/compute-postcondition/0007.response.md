The code snippet `yield candidate` is a generator statement that produces a value without terminating the function. The variable `candidate` is yielded, which means it will be returned to the caller when the generator is iterated over. The other variables `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and the function yields `candidate**
