Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string created by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` does not satisfy the validity condition, nothing is yielded.***
