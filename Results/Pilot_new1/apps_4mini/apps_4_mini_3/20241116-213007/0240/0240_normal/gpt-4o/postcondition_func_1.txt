The function accepts a string `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and returns True if `sub` is found in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to the length of `sub`. If these conditions are not met, it returns False. However, the code references `n_len`, which is not defined within the function, leading to a potential NameError. Therefore, the function may not operate as intended.
