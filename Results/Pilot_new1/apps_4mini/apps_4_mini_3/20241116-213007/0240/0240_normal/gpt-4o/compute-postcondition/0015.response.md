The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. The parameter `chars` is a string containing digits, and `sub` is a non-empty substring of `n`, where `n` is the original number formed by the digits in `chars` with no leading zeroes, except when `n` is zero itself. The function generates and returns a list of possible numbers that can be formed by inserting the substring `sub` into the string `chars` at various positions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `chars` containing digits and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns a list of possible numbers formed by inserting `sub` into `chars` at different positions.**
