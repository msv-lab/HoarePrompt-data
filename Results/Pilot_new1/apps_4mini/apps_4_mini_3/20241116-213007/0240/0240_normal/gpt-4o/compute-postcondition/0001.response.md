`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which means it is created by joining the characters in the permutation `perm` into a single string. The value of `perm` is known as the first permutation of `chars`, which is a non-empty string containing digits. Therefore, `candidate` will be a string composed of the digits in the order defined by `perm`. The states of the other variables (`chars` and `sub`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string created by joining `perm`.**
