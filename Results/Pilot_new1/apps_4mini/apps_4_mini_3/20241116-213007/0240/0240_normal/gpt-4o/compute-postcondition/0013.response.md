According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. In this case, `perm` is currently the third permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `perm` needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations of `chars`. 

Since `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, the next permutation after the third one would be the fourth permutation. Therefore, `perm` needs to be adjusted to the fourth permutation of `chars`.

The other variables, `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate`, do not need to be changed as they are not affected by the iteration of the loop.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `chars`, `perm` is the fourth permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the fourth permutation of `chars` as a string.**
