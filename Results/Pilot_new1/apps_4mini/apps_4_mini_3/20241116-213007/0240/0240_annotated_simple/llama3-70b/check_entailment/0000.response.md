To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code in relation to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a given string `s` (which is a shuffled version of `n` followed by `k`, where `k` is the number of digits in `n`) and a substring `t` that is known to be part of `n`. The output should be the smallest integer `n` that can be formed.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    # State of the program after the for loop has been executed: `n` is a string composed of characters from `s` that are also in `t_set`.
    n += t
    return int(n)
    # The program returns the integer value of the string 'n' after appending 't' to it
```

1. **Building the String `n`:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `n`.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If `c` is found in the set of characters from `t`, it appends `c` to `n`.
   - After the loop, it appends the substring `t` to `n`.

2. **Returning the Result:**
   - The program converts the final string `n` to an integer and returns it.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not ensure that `n` is the smallest possible integer. It only collects digits from `s` that are also in `t` and appends `t` at the end.
- This could lead to cases where the resulting integer is not minimal. For example, if `s` contains multiple digits that could be used to form `n`, the program does not sort or select them in a way that guarantees the smallest integer.

### Example that Breaks the Logic:
Let's consider the following input:
- `s = "3210"` (shuffled version of `n` and some digits)
- `t = "10"` (known substring)

According to the logic:
- The program will iterate through `s` and find `1` and `0`.
- `n` will be built as `10` (from the substring) and the loop will not add any digits as `2` and `3` are not in `t_set`.
- The final output will be `10`, which is not the smallest integer that can be formed with the digits from `s` and `t`. The correct smallest integer would be `1023`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not guarantee the smallest possible integer `n` and can produce incorrect results for some inputs, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
