According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `permutations(chars)`. The `permutations` function generates all possible permutations of the string `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next permutation. Since `perm` is currently the second permutation, we need to adjust it to the third permutation. The `permutations` function will continue yielding permutations until all have been exhausted.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `perm` should be updated to the third permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` should also be updated to reflect this new `perm`.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, we do not need to change it.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
