The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, the value of `candidate` will be the string representation of that third permutation. The states of the other variables (`chars` and `perm`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`**
