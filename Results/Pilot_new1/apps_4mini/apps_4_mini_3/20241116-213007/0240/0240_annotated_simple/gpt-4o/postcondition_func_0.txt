The function accepts a string `s` representing a shuffled sequence of digits and a non-empty string `sub`. It computes the remaining characters in `s` after removing the occurrences of characters in `sub`. It then generates possible numbers from these remaining characters and returns the minimum value from this list of possible numbers. If `s` does not contain enough occurrences of characters from `sub`, the resulting remaining characters may lead to incorrect or unexpected outputs, as the function does not handle cases where `s` has insufficient characters to form valid numbers.
