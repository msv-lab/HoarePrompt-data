The `yield` statement produces a generator, which means it returns the value of `candidate` without terminating the function. The value of `candidate` is equal to `perm`, which is the third permutation of `chars`. The values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`**
