The code counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the input string `s`. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned based on the counts of these characters in `s`. The initial state does not affect the counting of characters in the string `s`. Therefore, the output state reflects the results of the counting operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer from input, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
