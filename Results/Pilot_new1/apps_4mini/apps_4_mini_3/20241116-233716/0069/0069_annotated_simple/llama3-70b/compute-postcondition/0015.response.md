According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times, where `T` is a positive integer that specifies the number of iterations. If the loop has just completed one iteration, the state at the end of the previous iteration is relevant for determining whether the loop can execute again. 

Since the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the iteration count. After one iteration, the loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations `T` has not been exhausted.

If `T` is greater than 1 at the end of the last iteration, it means there are still iterations left. Therefore, we need to adjust `T` to reflect that one iteration has been completed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), T is greater than 1**
