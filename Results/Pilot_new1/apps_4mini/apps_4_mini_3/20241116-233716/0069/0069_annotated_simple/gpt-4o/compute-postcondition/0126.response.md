The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s`. 

- `T` is a positive integer, constrained between 1 and 100.
- `n` is a positive integer, constrained between 1 and 100,000.
- `x` is an integer, constrained between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000.
- `s` is a binary string of length `n`, consisting solely of characters '0' and '1'.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot detail the return value. However, we can summarize the accepted parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters T (a positive integer), n (a positive integer), x (an integer), and s (a binary string of length n).**
