Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is incremented by 1 if the integer `x` satisfies the condition that the difference between `x` and the first element `b` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient of that difference divided by `balance` is non-negative. If the condition is not met, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
