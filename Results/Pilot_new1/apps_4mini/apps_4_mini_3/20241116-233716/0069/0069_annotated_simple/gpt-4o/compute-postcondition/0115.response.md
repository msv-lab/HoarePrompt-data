Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of elements in the string `s`. If `balance` is 0, indicating equal counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, then if `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` is appended with -1; otherwise, it is appended with 0. If `balance` is not 0, `count` reflects the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that the difference `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and `results` is updated to include this `count`. Additionally, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length 1 filled with zeros, and no counts are computed.***
