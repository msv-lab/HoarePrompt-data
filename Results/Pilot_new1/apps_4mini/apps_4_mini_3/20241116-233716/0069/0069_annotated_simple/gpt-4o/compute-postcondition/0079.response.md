According to the code, the loop will execute `T` times, and the variable `_` is used as a placeholder for the loop iteration. The loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `T` is greater than 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, we don't have information about the value of `T`, but we know that the loop will execute again if `T` is greater than 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `T` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` that represents the cumulative balance based on the characters in string `s`, `balance` is 0, `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1, `T` is greater than 1**
