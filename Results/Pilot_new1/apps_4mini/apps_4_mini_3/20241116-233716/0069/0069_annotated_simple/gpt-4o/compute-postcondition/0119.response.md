The `print(result)` statement outputs the value of `result`. The value of `result` is the first output in `results`, and since `results` contains at least 1 output, `result` has a defined value. The values of `T` and `n` are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state is: `results` contains at least 1 output, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, and the value of `result` is printed.

Output State: **`results` contains at least 1 output, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, and the value of `result` is printed**.
