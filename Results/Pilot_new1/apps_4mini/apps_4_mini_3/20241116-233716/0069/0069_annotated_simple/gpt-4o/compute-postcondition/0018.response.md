According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it can be assured that `i` can be equal to `n + 1` in the next iteration. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and `s[2]`.**
