The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition of `s[i - 1]`. The value of `prefix_balances[1]` can be either 1 or -1, depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'. The value of `s[i - 1]` determines whether we add 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '0') or subtract 1 (if `s[i - 1]` is '1') from `prefix_balances[i - 1]`. Since `i` is greater than `n + 1`, we do not have specific values for `i` or `n`, but we know that the update occurs based on `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the value of `s[i - 1]`; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`**
