Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for at least one index `i` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n), `prefix_balances[i]` is not equal to 0. If `n` is greater than 0, then the cumulative balance represented in `prefix_balances` indicates that the number of '0's is not equal to the number of '1's in the first `n` characters of string `s`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `1`.***
