Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' up to the i-th position in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, and `i` will range from 1 to `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `1` filled with zeros. The final value of `prefix_balances[n]` will depend on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` and will equal `balance` if `n` is greater than 0.**
