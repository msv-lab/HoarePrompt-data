The value of `results` is modified by appending `-1`. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of those variables and the modification to `results`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of integers, `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` has `-1` appended to it.**
