Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `b` is the second element of the list, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This ensures that `x` is sufficiently related to `b` and `balance` such that the conditions are met for incrementing `count`.***
