Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` for each '0' and `-1` for each '1' up to the i-th position in the string `s`. The value of `balance` is 0, indicating that the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` are equal. If `n` is at least 1, the loop has executed `n` times; otherwise, if `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of length `1` filled with zeros.***
