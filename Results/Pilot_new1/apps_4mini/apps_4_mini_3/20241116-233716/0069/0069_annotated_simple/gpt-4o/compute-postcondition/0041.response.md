Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of integers representing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, and `balance` is an integer. If `balance` is equal to 0, and if `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, then `results` will contain `-1`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` will contain `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` will represent the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` will include this `count`. The case where `n` is 0 or lower is handled by ensuring `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, which means no elements will contribute to `count` in the else part.***
