The `print(result)` statement outputs the value of `result`. The value of `result` is the second output in the `results`, and since `results` contains at least 2 outputs, `result` has a defined value. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `result` is printed.

Output State: **`results` contains at least 2 outputs, `T` is greater than 0, `n` can be any value, and `result` is printed**.
