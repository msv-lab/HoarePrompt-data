The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables, `prefix_balances` and `b`, are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`, and `count` is increased by 1**
