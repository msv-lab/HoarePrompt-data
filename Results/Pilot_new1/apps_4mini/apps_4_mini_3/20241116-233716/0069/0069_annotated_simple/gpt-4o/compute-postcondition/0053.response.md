According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the range defined by `n`. The loop is set to run for `i` values from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which is the upper limit of the loop range. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1` (the current value), and since the loop condition is already at its upper limit, the range becomes invalid for further iterations.

Since `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, we must ensure that the state reflects that `i` is now out of the range for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to indicate that `i` is now greater than `n + 1` to reflect the end of the loop's execution.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on whether `s[0]` is '0' or '1'; `i` is greater than `n + 1`; `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`**
