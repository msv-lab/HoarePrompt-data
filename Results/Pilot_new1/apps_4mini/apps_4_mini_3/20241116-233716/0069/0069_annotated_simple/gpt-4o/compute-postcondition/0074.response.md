Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length at least `n + 2`, `b` is `prefix_balances[n]`, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This ensures that `count` is incremented only when the difference between `x` and `b` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`.***
