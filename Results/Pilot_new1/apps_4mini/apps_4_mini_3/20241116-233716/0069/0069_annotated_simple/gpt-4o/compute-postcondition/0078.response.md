Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` that represents the cumulative balance based on the characters in string `s`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1; if `x` is not found, `results` contains 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `1`, and `results` will reflect whether `x` is present (resulting in -1) or not (resulting in 0). If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, and `results` includes this `count`.***
