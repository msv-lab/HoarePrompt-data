Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and the balance is not equal to `x`. The difference `(x - balance)` is not divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, meaning that either `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` or the values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` do not allow for a whole number result when dividing `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`.*
