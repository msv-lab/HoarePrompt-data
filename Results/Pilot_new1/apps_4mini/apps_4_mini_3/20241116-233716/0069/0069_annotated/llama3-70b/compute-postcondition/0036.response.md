Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the loop will not execute the second condition (division by zero), and the output will depend on the first condition. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which will be valid as long as `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`. If `T` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and no outputs are generated. If `T` is greater than 100, the loop does not execute due to the constraints.**
