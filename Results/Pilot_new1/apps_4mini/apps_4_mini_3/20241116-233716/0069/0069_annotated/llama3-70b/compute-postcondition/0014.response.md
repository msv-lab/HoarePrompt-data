Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If the difference between `x` and `balance` is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, the function prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` to prevent division by zero, while maintaining the relationships between `x`, `balance`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1` throughout.
