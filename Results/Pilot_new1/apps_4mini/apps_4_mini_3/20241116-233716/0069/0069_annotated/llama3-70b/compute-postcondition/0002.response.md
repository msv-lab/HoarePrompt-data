The code snippet assigns values to `n` and `x` using the `map` function, which converts the input values into integers. The variables `n` and `x` will take on new values based on the input provided, but the specific values are not known at this point. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, and `x` is an integer within the range of -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000. 

Since the values of `n` and `x` are directly taken from input, the output state will reflect that `n` and `x` have been updated to the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer**
