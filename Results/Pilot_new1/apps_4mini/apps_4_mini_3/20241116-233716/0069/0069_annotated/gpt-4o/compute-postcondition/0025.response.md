Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` indicates the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`; `balance` is 0. If `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include -1. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, `results` is updated to include 0. In both cases, the integrity of `prefix_balances` and the value of `balance` remain unchanged.***
