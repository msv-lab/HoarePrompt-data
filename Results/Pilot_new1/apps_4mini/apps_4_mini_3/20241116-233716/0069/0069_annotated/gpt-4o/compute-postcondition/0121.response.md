The function prints `result`, but the value of `result` is not defined in the initial state. The initial state indicates that `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, but it does not specify that `result` is defined or what its value is. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the function attempts to print `result` without it being defined.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the function attempts to print an undefined variable `result`.**
