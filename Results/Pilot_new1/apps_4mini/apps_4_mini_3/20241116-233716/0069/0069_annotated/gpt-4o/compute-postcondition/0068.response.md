Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are also equal to 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is incremented by 1 if the difference between `x` and `b` (which is 0) is divisible by `balance` and the quotient is non-negative. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
