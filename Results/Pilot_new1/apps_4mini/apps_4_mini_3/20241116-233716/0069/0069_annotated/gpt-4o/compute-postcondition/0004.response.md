The code initializes an empty list `results`. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as no other operations are performed on them. Therefore, the output state reflects the current state of the variables.

Output State: **`T` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list.**
