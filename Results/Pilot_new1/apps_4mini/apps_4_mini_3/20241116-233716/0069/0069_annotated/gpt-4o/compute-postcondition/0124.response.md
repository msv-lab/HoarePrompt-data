According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 4 elements, `result` should be the fourth element in the list, and the loop variable should be updated accordingly.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `results` is a list with at least 4 elements, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `result` is the fourth element in the list `results`.**
