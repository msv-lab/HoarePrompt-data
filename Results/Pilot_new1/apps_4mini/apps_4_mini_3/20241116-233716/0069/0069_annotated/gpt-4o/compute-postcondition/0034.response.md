Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[0]`, and `count` is an integer. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not met, `count` remains 0. This covers the cases where `x` is less than or equal to `b`, where `balance` is zero, and where `x - b` is not divisible by `balance`.***
