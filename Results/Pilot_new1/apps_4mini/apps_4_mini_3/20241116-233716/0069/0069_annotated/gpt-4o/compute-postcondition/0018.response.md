According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Since `n` is greater than 1, it does not restrict the loop from executing again, but for the loop to continue, `n` must also be at least 3 (to ensure `i` can be less than or equal to `n`). 

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 3 and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on `s[1]`; `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2**
