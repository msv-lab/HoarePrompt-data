Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements initialized with zeros, `balance` is not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` is increased by 3. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This ensures that the conditions for incrementing `count` are strictly followed, considering both scenarios where the conditions are met and where they are not.***
