According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. 

We also need to consider the conditions that affect `results`:
1. If `balance` is 0, `results` includes `-1` if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, and `0` if it is not.
2. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of valid indices `b` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes this `count`.

Moreover, the loop will not execute if `T` is 0 or lower, or if `n` is 0 or lower, which means `prefix_balances` would remain initialized with all zeros.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states so that:
- `results` is not empty (it must contain at least one element).
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure `prefix_balances` is initialized correctly.
- `T` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted states would be:
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length greater than 1, `results` is not empty, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0**
