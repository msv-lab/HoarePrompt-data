Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are equal to 0. If `balance` is equal to 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`. If `balance` is equal to 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` represents the number of valid indices `b` in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes this `count`. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains initialized as described and the loop does not execute.***
