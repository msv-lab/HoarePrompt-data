Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, where `balance` is calculated as `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `x` is an integer derived from `data[index + 1]`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not found in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes `-1` and `0`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` with a non-negative quotient, and `results` is updated to include this `count`. Additionally, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, and `index` has been increased by 3. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains initialized with all zeros.***
