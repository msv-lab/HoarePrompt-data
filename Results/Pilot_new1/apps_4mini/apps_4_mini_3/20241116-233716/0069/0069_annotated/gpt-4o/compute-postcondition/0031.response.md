Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is `prefix_balances[0]`, and `count` is 0 initially. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the conditions are satisfied. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged at 0.***
