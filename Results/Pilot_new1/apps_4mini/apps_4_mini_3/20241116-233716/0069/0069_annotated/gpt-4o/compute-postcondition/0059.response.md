The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. The previous values of the affected variables are `prefix_balances` (which remains unchanged), `balance` (which remains unchanged), and `x` (which is an element in `prefix_balances` and remains unchanged). The `results` list is affected by the addition of `-1`. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, all other indices are equal to 0; `balance` is equal to 0; `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`; and `results` now includes `-1`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, all other indices are equal to 0; `balance` is equal to 0; `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`; and `results` now includes `-1`.**
