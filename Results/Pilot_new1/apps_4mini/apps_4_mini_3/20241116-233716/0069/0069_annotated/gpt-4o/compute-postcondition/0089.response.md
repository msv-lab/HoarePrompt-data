Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is either updated to 2 or 0 based on the value of `s[i - 1]`, `balance` is `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `x` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `results` includes `-1`, `T` is greater than the current iteration index, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` is `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 2.**
