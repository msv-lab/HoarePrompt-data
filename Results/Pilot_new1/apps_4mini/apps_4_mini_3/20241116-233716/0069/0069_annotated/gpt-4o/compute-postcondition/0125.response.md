Output State: **`results` is a list containing the outputs to be printed, with its length indicating the number of results printed. If `T` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute and `results` remains an empty list. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` is a list of length 1 containing only `0`, and the loop does not execute. If `results` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no values are printed. If `results` contains elements, the loop executes for each element in `results`, printing each `result` in sequence.**
