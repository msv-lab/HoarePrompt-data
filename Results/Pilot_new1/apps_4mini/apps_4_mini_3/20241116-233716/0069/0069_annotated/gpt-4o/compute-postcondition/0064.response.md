The variable `count` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `prefix_balances` is not affected by this assignment, and the value of `balance` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and all other indices are also equal to 0; `balance` is not equal to 0; `count` is 0**
