The value at `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the values of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. Given that `i` is 2, we check the previous value of `prefix_balances[1]` and the character `s[1]` (which corresponds to `s[i - 1]`). 

The output state reflects the updated value at index 2 of `prefix_balances`, which is determined by adding `1` if `s[1]` is `'0'`, or subtracting `1` if it is not.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)`**
