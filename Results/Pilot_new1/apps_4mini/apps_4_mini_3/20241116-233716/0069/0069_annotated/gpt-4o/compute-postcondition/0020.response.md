Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` indicates the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's up to index `i - 1` in the string `s`. The value of `balance` is 0, indicating that the total count of '0's and '1's in the string `s` is equal.***
