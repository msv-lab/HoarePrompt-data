The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the result of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` plus either 1 or -1, depending on whether `s[i - 1]` is '0' or not. The value of `prefix_balances` is affected at index `i`, while the other variables remain unchanged. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, we can assume `prefix_balances` has at least two elements, and `s` has enough characters. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[i]` based on the value of `s[i - 1]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
