According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. 

To ensure that the loop executes, we need to adjust the states as follows:

1. If `T` is greater than 0, then there should be at least one test case processed, which means `results` should contain the outcomes based on those test cases.
2. If `T` is 0, the loop will not execute, hence `results` will remain an empty list, and we cannot proceed with the loop.
3. If `results` is empty (which would be the case if no test cases were processed or if all processed cases did not append any results), the loop cannot execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty, which implies that at least one test case has been processed and appended a result.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `T` is greater than 0**
