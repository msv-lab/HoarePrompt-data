According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements left in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements remaining, and `result` is the first element in that list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements remaining (which it does), and `result` must be updated to the next element in the list. Therefore, `result` should be the second element in the list after the first iteration.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element remaining, `result` is the second element in the list**
