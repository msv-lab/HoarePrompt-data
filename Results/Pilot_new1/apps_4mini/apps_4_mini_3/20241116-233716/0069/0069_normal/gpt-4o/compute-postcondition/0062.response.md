Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, `balance` is equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, and `index` has been increased by 3. If `x` is an integer that exists in `prefix_balances`, then `-1` has been appended to `results`. If `x` is an integer not present in `prefix_balances`, then `0` has been appended to `results`.***
