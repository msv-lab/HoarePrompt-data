According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the contents of the `results` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element remaining, which means it had at least 1 element before the last iteration began. After the last iteration, there is still at least 1 element remaining, so for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least 2 elements, and the current `result` should be the first element in the list.

State: **`results` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements remaining, result is the first element in the list**
