Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable, `balance` is not equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `index` is increased by 3. If `(x - b) % balance` is equal to 0 and `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains 0.***
