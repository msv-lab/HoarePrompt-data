Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances of '0's and '1's in the string `s` up to each index from 1 to `n`, the value of `balance` is equal to 0, and the value `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`. If `n` is at least 1, then the loop has executed `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1.```
