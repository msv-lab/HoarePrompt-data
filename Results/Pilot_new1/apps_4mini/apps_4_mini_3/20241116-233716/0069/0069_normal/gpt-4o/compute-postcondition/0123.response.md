The code prints the value of `result`, which is the first element of the list `results`. Since `results` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `result` has a specific value corresponding to the first element of that list. The execution of the print statement does not change the state of any variables.

Output State: **`results` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements remaining, `result` is the first element in the list, and the function prints the value of `result`.**
