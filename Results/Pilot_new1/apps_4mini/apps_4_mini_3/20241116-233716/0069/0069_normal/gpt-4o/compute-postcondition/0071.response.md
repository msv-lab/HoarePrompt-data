Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable with at least 4 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `index` is increased by 1. If the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is non-negative, then `count` is increased by 1. If the conditions are not met, `count` remains unchanged.***
