Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, and `balance` is 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to `results`. In the case where `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, and the same logic applies to appending values to `results`.***
