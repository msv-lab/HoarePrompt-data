Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance of zeros and ones from the string `s`, calculated for each index from 1 to `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop executes `n` times, updating `prefix_balances` accordingly. If `n` is less than 1, `prefix_balances` remains as a list of zeros of length `n + 1`. `balance` is not equal to 0, `T` is greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a string, and `index` is increased by 3.***
