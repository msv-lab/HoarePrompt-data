The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. Given that `i` is 3, this means we are updating `prefix_balances[3]` based on the value of `prefix_balances[2]` and the character at `s[2]`. The previous value of `prefix_balances[2]` is already known from the initial state. The character `s[2]` will determine whether we add 1 or subtract 1 from `prefix_balances[2]`.

Since the specific values of `prefix_balances[2]` and `s[2]` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact new value of `prefix_balances[3]`. However, the output state will reflect that `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the calculation involving `prefix_balances[2]` and the character in `s`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the character `s[2]`**
