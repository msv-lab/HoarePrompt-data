The code takes input from the user and splits it into a list called `data`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, but `data` will now hold the split values of the input. Since `data` can contain multiple values based on the user's input, it will be a list of strings.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, and `data` is a list of input strings**.
