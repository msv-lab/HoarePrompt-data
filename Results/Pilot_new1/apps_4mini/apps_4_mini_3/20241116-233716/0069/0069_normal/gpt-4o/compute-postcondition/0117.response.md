Output State: **`results` contains the outcomes based on the calculations performed for each test case, `prefix_balances` is a list of cumulative balances of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, `T` is the total number of test cases, `x` is an integer, and `index` is incremented by 3 for each test case. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list. If `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length 1, and the logic for appending values to `results` applies accordingly, resulting in either -1 or 0 being appended based on the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`, otherwise 0 is appended. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is the number of valid indices in `prefix_balances` where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`.**
