Functionality: ** The function accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (the length of a binary string), an integer `x`, and a binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in `s` and determines how many indices in the prefix balances allow for a valid transformation to reach `x` using the balance. If the balance is zero and `x` is present in the prefix balances, it returns -1; if not, it returns 0. If the balance is not zero, it counts valid indices where the transformation is possible and returns that count. The function prints the results for each test case. **
