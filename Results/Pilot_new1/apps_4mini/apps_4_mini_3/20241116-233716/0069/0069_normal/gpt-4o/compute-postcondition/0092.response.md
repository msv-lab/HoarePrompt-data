According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4 in the next iteration, and `n` must be at least 4 to allow this execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be updated to 4.
- `n` should be adjusted to be at least 4 to ensure the loop can continue.

State: **`prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2 or 0 if `s[1]` is '0', or 0 or -2 if `s[1]` is '1'; `i` is 4; `n` is at least 4**
