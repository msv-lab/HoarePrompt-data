The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. Given that `index` is 1, this means `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`. The values of `T`, `results`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state indicates the values of the affected variables.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[1])`, `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[2])`, and `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]**.
