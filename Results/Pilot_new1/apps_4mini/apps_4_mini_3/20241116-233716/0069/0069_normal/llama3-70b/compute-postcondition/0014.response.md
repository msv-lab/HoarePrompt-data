Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `iteration` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x`, and the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it computes and prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that `cnt0` and `cnt1` are distinct to avoid division by zero.***
