The values of `n` and `x` are assigned new values from the input, which are both positive integers. The previous values of `n` and `x` are not specified, but they will be updated based on the input. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `x`, while indicating that they are now assigned from input.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `iteration` is 0, and `n, x` are assigned new values from input.**
