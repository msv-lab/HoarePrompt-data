Postcondition: ***`cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is assigned the value `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1, indicating that `x` is perfectly balanced with respect to the difference of counts of '0's and '1's. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the calculation `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which is an integer reflecting the adjusted value based on the balance of counts. This encompasses the case where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a division by zero situation, which should be handled separately to avoid runtime errors.***
