The variables `n` and `x` are assigned new values based on the input. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5) and `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9). After executing the code, `n` and `x` will take on the values provided by the user input. The other variables (`s`, `iteration`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), and the values of `s`, `iteration`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged.**
