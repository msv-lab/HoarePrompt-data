Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special handling is required as the behavior is undefined in that case; the output will be -1 when `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the output will be `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute and all variables remain unchanged. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute as there is no input to process, leaving `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` undefined.**
