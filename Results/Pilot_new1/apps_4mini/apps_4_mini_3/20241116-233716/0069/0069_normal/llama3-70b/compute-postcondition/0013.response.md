Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 <= x <= 10^9), `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `iteration` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function computes and prints the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, handling the edge case where `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1`, which would lead to a division by zero if not properly accounted for, as `cnt0` and `cnt1` must be distinct for the division to be valid.***
