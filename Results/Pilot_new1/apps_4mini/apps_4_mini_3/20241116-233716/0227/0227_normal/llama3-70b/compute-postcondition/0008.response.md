According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its last value, which is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`, which means `i` should be increased to `n`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` can take the value of `n`. The state of `m` will not change because the loop has not executed yet for the current value of `i`. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be set to `n`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `n`**
