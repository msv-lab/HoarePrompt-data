The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, but the specific values of the elements in `a` are not provided. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` has been sorted, but we cannot specify its contents.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of integers from input.**
