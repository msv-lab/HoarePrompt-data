Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is either 1 or 2. If the element at index `i` of `a` is not equal to twice the element at index `i - 1` of `a`, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being 2. If the element at index `i` is equal to twice the element at index `i - 1`, then `m` remains 1.***
