Output State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If no such `x` is found after iterating through all elements of `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False. `i` is 3, `m` is unchanged, and `n` is greater than 3.**
