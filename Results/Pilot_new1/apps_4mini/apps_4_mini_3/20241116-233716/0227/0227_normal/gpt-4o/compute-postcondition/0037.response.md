The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. Since the initial state specifies that `can_form` is already `True`, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`m`, `a`, `x`, and `assigned`) remain unaffected as there are no operations performed on them. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `x`, and `assigned` are unchanged.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `a`, `x`, and `assigned` are unchanged**.
