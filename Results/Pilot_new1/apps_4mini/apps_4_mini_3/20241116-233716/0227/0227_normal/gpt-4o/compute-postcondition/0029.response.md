The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`, changing its previous value from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`m`, `assigned`, `i`, `n`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this change.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[i]`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `a[2]`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`**
