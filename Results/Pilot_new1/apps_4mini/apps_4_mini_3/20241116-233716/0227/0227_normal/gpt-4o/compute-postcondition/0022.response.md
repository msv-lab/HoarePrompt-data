The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. The values of `can_form` and `assigned` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False, `assigned` is either empty or contains only elements such that for every `x` in `assigned`, there does not exist an element `a[i]` in `assigned` for which `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`; `m` is increased by 1.
