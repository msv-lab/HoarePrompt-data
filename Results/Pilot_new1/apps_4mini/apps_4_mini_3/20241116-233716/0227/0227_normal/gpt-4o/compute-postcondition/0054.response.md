The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 3, `assigned` includes at least 2 elements, `m` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `assigned` includes at least 2 elements, `m` is unchanged, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**.
