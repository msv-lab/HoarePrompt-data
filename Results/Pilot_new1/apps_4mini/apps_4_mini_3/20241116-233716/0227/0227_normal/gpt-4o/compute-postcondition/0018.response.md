Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing at least 2 distinct positive integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, indicating that a valid pairing has been found; otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
