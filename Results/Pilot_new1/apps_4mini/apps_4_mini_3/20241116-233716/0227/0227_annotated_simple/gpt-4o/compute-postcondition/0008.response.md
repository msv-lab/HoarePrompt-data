The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, `x`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`.
