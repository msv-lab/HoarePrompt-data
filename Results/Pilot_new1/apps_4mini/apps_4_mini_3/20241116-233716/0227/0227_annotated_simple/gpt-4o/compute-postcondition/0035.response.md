Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `assigned` is a list with at least 3 elements, and `x` is the third element in the list `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the `assigned` list, the loop is exited, and `can_form` remains True. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, the state of `can_form` is unchanged, remaining True, and the loop continues if applicable.***
