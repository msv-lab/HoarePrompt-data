The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` was 3, so after execution, `m` becomes 4. The values of `can_form`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is False, `m` is 4, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is 4, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3**
