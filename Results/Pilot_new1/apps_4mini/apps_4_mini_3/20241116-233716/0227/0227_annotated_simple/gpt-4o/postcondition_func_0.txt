The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts and returns the number of groups formed based on the condition that for each element `a[i]`, if there is no previously assigned element `x` such that `a[i] - x` is also in the assigned set, then a new group is formed. The function returns the total count of such groups. If `n` is 1, it will always return 1 since there is only one element.
