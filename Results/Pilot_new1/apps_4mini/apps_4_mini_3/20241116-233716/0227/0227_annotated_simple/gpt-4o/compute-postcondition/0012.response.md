The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not depend on any of the previous values of the affected variables, and it does not change them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the other variables along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `assigned`, and `can_form` is True**.
