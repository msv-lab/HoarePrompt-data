The value of `can_form` is assigned as `False`, which means it remains unchanged from its initial value. The states of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `n`, and `assigned`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is False; `m` is increased to 3; `i` is 3; `n` is greater than 3; `assigned` now contains the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`can_form` is False; `m` is increased to 3; `i` is 3; `n` is greater than 3; `assigned` now contains the element `a[i]`**.
