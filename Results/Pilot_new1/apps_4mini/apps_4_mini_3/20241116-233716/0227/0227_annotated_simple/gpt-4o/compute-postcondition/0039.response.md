Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2, `assigned` is a list with at least 4 elements, and `x` is the fourth element in the list `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` remains True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing beyond this block.***
