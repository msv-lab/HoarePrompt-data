The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the condition 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer `a[k]` satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, the program returns the count of groups formed based on the condition described, which is stored in variable `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers, and return the count of groups formed based on certain conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, and returns the count of groups formed based on specific conditions.**
