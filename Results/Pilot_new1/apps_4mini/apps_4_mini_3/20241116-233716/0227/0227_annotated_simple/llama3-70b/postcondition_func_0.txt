The function accepts an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts how many integers in the list do not satisfy the condition `a[i] == a[i - 1] * 2` for each consecutive pair of integers. If the count is greater than 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 23, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
