Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It counts how many elements in the sorted list are not double the preceding element, starting the count from 1. If the count exceeds 23, it returns -1; otherwise, it returns the count. If `n` is 1, it directly returns 1 since there are no preceding elements to compare. The function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) or where the input list does not meet the constraints. **
