Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, the loop is exited. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, the program continues without breaking out of the loop.***
