Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1, and the elements in `assigned` and the value of `i` remain unchanged. If `can_form` is True, the state of `m`, `assigned`, and `i` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `assigned` has fewer than 2 elements, `can_form` remains False, `m` is still incremented by 1, and the state of `assigned` and `i` remains unchanged.***
