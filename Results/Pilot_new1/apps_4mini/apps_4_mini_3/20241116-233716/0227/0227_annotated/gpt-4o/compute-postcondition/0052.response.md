Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if the difference between `a[2]` and `x` (which is `a[2]`) is in `assigned`, resulting in `m` being incremented by 1. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, `m` is still incremented by 1, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2, with `x` being `a[2]`.***
