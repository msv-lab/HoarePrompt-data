Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` is the third element in `assigned`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains unchanged and the program continues without any modifications to its state.***
