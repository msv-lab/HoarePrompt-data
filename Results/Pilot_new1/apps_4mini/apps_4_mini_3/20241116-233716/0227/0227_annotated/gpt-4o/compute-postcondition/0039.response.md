Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains at least one more element, and `x` is the next element in the list `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no changes occur to `can_form` or `m`.***
