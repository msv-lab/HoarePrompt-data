Postcondition: ***If `can_form` is False, then `m` is incremented by 1. If `assigned` was empty before the loop, it now includes `a[2]`, `i` remains unchanged, and `n` is greater than the final value of `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i` before the loop starts, the values of `m`, `i`, and `assigned` remain unchanged. If `can_form` is True, the values of `m`, `i`, and `assigned` also remain unchanged.***
