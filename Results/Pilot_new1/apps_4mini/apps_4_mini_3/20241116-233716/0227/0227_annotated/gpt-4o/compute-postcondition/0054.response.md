The value of `can_form` is assigned `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, with `x` being the third element in `assigned`.

Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` includes at least 3 elements, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, with `x` being the third element in `assigned**
