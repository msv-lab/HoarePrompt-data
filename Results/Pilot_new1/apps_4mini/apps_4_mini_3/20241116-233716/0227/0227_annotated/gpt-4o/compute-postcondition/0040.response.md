According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `assigned` list. Since `assigned` contains at least one more element, the loop can continue to execute as long as there are still elements left in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the next element in the list `assigned`. For the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must contain at least one additional element beyond the current `x`. Therefore, `x` needs to be updated to the next element in the list `assigned`, and the length of `assigned` must be at least 2 to ensure that there are more elements to iterate through.

State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `x` is the next element in the list `assigned`**
