The variable `a_block` is calculated using the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this operation. The output state will reflect the values of all variables, including the newly calculated `a_block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
