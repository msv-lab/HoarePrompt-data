Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is undefined; min_block_time cannot be calculated; `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.***
