Given the initial state where `n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input, `a` is an integer from input, `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `b` is undefined:

The code attempts to calculate `min_block_time` using the expression `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. However, since `b_block` is based on `b`, which is undefined, we cannot compute `b_block`. Therefore, the calculation for `min_block_time` cannot proceed.

The output state reflects that `b_block` is undefined, which prevents the calculation from being completed.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` is an integer from input; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_block` is undefined; min_block_time cannot be calculated.**
