The variables `a` and `b` are assigned new values from the input, which is processed by `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unchanged, and `n`, `m`, and `k` remain as integers assigned from input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b` while indicating that `n`, `m`, and `k` are still unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned from input; `a` and `b` are new integers from input.**
