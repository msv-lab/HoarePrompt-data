The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates under the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers within the range of 1 to `n·m·k` with the condition that `a` is not equal to `b`. 

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, based on the constraints alone, we cannot determine the specific return value or behavior of the function. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates under constraints for integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b). The specific return value is not provided.**
