The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`, which is an integer representing an apartment number. The constraints specify that `apartment` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k. The function returns values for 'block' and 'floor' based on calculations derived from the given apartment number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding 'block' and 'floor' values based on its calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on calculations from the given apartment number.**
