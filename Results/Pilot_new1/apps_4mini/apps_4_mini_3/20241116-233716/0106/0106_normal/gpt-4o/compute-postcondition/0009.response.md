To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the code provided.

1. The variables `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are already calculated based on the initial state.
2. The code snippet calculates `min_walk_time` as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Since the values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are known from the initial state, `min_walk_time` will be assigned the smaller of the two values.

Thus, the output state reflects the values of `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, and the newly computed `min_walk_time`.

Output State: **`direct_walk_time` is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
