The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The value of `apartment` is not provided, but it is used in the calculation. The previous value of `block` is also dependent on `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, but since we are only calculating `floor_within_block`, we focus on that.

The output state will include the information about `floor_within_block` being calculated based on the given formula. Therefore, the output state is: `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k).

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `floor_within_block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) % (m * k)**
