To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we need to analyze the assignment of the variable `block`.

The variable `block` is calculated using the formula:

```
block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
```

Here, `apartment` is assumed to be an integer within the range specified (1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k). The variables `m` and `k` are also within the range of positive integers (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000).

1. **Calculation of `m * k`:** This results in a positive integer since both `m` and `k` are positive integers.

2. **Calculation of `(apartment - 1)`:** This gives a non-negative integer, as `apartment` is at least 1.

3. **Integer Division `//`:** The expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k)` calculates how many complete blocks of size `m * k` fit into `apartment - 1`.

4. **Final Calculation of `block`:** Adding 1 to the result of the integer division gives the block number that the apartment belongs to.

Since the exact values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, we will state the output state in a generalized manner.

Output State: **`block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1**
