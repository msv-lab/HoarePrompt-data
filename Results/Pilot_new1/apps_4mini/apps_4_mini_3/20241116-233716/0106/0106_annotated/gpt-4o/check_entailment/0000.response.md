To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, we need to evaluate the logic implemented in the functions and how they relate to the problem requirements.

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem Description**:
   - Edward and Natasha live in a building with a specific structure defined by `n` (number of blocks), `m` (number of floors per block), and `k` (number of apartments per floor).
   - The time to navigate through the building is defined by:
     - 5 seconds per floor (up or down).
     - 15 seconds to move between adjacent blocks.
     - 10 seconds wait for the elevator, plus 1 second per floor for the elevator ride.
   - Edward can only exit from the first floor of his block, and he can enter a block instantly.

2. **Function 1** (`func_1`):
   - It uses the `get_location` function to determine Edward's and Natasha's block and floor.
   - The time to exit is calculated based on whether Edward is already on the first floor or not.
   - It calculates the minimum walking time either clockwise or counterclockwise between blocks.
   - Finally, it computes the time to reach Natasha's floor.

3. **Function 2** (`get_location`):
   - This function calculates the block and floor of a given apartment.
   - However, it relies on `m` and `k` being in the global scope, which can lead to errors if they are not defined.

### Issues Identified

- **Undefined Variables**: The `get_location` function does not take `m` and `k` as parameters, which could lead to errors when it is called. This is a critical flaw as it breaks the encapsulation of the function.
  
- **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If Edward is on the first floor of his block, the time to exit is correctly set to 0. However, if he is on any other floor, the calculation assumes he will always use the elevator without considering the fastest combination of using stairs or the elevator.
   - The calculation of `min_walk_time` does not account for the cases where moving in one direction might lead to a longer overall time due to the need to return to the first floor.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with undefined variables and the potential oversight in calculating the best method for Edward to reach Natasha, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description comprehensively. 

Thus, the final determination is:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle cases where the elevator or stairs might not be the optimal choice depending on the starting and target floors, and it also has issues with variable scope that can lead to runtime errors.
