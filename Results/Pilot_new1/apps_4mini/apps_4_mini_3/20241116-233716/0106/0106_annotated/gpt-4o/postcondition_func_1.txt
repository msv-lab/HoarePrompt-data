The function accepts an integer parameter `apartment` and calculates the `block` and `floor` within that block based on the apartment number. However, the function relies on the variables `m` and `k`, which are not defined within the function or passed as parameters, leading to potential errors if they are not defined in the global scope. The function returns a tuple containing the calculated `block` and `floor`. If `m` and `k` are not defined, a NameError will occur when the function is called.
