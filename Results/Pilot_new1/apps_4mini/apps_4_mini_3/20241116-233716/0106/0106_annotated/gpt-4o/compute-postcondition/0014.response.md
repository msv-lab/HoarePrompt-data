Functionality: ** The function accepts five parameters: integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and apartment numbers `a` and `b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from apartment `a` and reach apartment `b` based on their respective floors and blocks. However, the function does not define how to calculate `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` since the `get_location` function is not provided, leading to potential undefined values for `min_walk_time` and `time_to_target_floor`. As a result, the function may return an undefined value for `total_time`. **
