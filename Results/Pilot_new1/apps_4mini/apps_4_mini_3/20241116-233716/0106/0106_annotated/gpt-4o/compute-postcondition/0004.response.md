The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer that represents an apartment number, and it must be distinct and within the range of 1 to n·m·k, where n, m, and k are positive integers constrained between 1 and 1000. The function returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the calculations derived from the `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding 'block' and 'floor' values based on its calculations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on calculations involving the apartment number, m, and k.**
