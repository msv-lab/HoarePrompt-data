The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers representing dimensions with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000. The parameters `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers, constrained by 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. The function does not return a defined value for `total_time` due to the undefined values of `min_walk_time` and `time_to_target_floor`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, and b, but does not return a defined value for total_time due to undefined values of min_walk_time and time_to_target_floor.**
