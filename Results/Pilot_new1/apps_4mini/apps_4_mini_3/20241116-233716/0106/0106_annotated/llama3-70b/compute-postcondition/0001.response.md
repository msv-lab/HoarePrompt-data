The variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from `input()`, which expects two integers separated by space. The `map(int, ...)` function converts these inputs into integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `a` and `b` as input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned positive integers from input such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are input integers.**
