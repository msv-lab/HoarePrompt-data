The code calculates `min_floor_time` using the formula `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. The previous values of the affected variables are `a_floor`, which is greater than `b_floor`, and both are derived from the calculations involving the input integer `a` and the integer `b`. The exact values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are not specified, but since `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, we can denote `a_floor = b_floor + x` for some positive integer `x`.

Thus, substituting this into the formula gives us:
```
min_floor_time = (b_floor + x - b_floor) * 5 + 10
                = x * 5 + 10
```

The output state reflects the relationship between the variables without specific numeric values, as they depend on the input values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an input integer; `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10.**
