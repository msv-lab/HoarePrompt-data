Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. `a` is an input integer. `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`. `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. The value of `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.***
