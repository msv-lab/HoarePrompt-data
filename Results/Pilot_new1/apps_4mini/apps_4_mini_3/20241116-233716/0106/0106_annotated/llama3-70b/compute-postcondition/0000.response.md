The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which reads a line of input, splits it into separate values, and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not specified but are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000. Therefore, after execution, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values provided by the user input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned positive integers from input such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000**
