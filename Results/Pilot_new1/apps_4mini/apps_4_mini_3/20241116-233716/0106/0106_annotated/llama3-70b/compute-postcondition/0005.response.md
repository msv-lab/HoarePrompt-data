The value of `b_block` is assigned the expression `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `m` and `k` are positive integers from input, and `b` is unknown. The calculation of `b_block` depends on the value of `b`, which is not specified. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b_block` is dependent on the unknown `b`. The states of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `a_block`, and `b_floor` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers from input; `a` is an input integer; `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1` where `b` is unknown.**
