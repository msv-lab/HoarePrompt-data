Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` is an input integer; `min_block_time` is not defined; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the values of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; the result of `print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)` is not determinable without specific values for `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
