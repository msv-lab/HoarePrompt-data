The variable `time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The calculation depends on the value of `floor_b`, which is not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`.

Output State: **`time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5**
