Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are distinct integers; `a_floor` is calculated as (a - 1) % m + 1, and `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`; `a_block` is calculated as (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 and `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is calculated as min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; the output of the print statement is `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.**
