The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the values from `input()`, which are split and converted to integers. The initial state indicates that `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input, but those values do not affect `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are distinct integers within the specified range, they will take on the values provided by the user input. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a` and `b` are now assigned new values based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new positive integer values from input; `a` and `b` are assigned new distinct integer values from input.**
