The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. However, it operates within the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate under the specified constraints of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, but without further details on the output, we cannot define its functionality completely.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that n, m, and k are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and a and b are distinct integers (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k), but the output is not specified.**
