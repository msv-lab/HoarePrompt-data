To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze how it computes the time it takes for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description.

### Breakdown of the Code

1. **Function `get_location(apartment)`**: This function calculates the block (or подъезд) and floor of the given apartment number.
   - `block` is calculated by dividing the apartment number by the total number of apartments per block (`m * k`).
   - `floor_within_block` is calculated to find the specific floor within that block.
   - The floor is then determined by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k`.

2. **Time Calculations**:
   - `time_to_exit`: If Edward is on the first floor, it takes 0 seconds to exit; otherwise, it includes a 10-second wait for the elevator and additional seconds to go down to the first floor.
   - `direct_walk_time`: This is the time taken to walk directly from Edward's block to Natasha's block.
   - `reverse_walk_time`: This is the time taken to walk in the opposite direction.
   - `min_walk_time`: The minimum of the two walking times is chosen.
   - `time_to_target_floor`: This is the time taken to go from the first floor to Natasha's floor.

3. **Total Time Calculation**: Finally, it sums up `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` to get the total time.

### Case Analysis

Now, let's consider potential edge cases that could break the logic:

- **Edge Case 1**: What if Edward lives on the first floor (e.g., apartment 1) and Natasha lives on the first floor of another block (e.g., apartment 2)? The program should correctly identify that Edward can walk directly to Natasha without needing to use the elevator.
  
- **Edge Case 2**: If Edward and Natasha are in adjacent blocks (e.g., apartments 1 and 2), the program should ensure that it calculates the walking time correctly, accounting for the circular nature of the building.

- **Edge Case 3**: The program should handle cases where Edward is on the last floor of a block and Natasha is on the first floor of another block. The elevator logic should be correctly implemented to ensure the total time reflects the elevator wait and travel time accurately.

### Testing the Code

Let's analyze a specific case:

- **Input**: `1 1 1` (1 block, 1 floor, 1 apartment) and `1 2` (Edward in apartment 1, Natasha in apartment 2).
- **Expected Output**: Since there is only one apartment, this case should not exist as both apartments can't be different.

However, we can check a valid case:

- **Input**: `2 1 1` (2 blocks, 1 floor, 1 apartment each) and `1 2` (Edward in apartment 1, Natasha in apartment 2).
- **Expected Output**: Edward can walk directly to Natasha, which should take 15 seconds.

### Conclusion

Upon reviewing the program, it seems to handle the cases discussed correctly. However, the logic for calculating the time when both apartments are on the first floor might be flawed because it does not account for the case where the blocks are adjacent correctly, as it only considers the absolute difference between blocks.

Therefore, the program does not handle every potential case correctly, particularly for edge cases involving apartments on the same floor but different blocks.

Correctness: **False**
