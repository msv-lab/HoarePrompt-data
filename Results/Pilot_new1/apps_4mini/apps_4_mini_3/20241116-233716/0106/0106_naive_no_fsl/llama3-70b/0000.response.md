To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic and calculations made in the code against the problem description.

1. **Understanding Input and Output**:
   - The program takes inputs for the number of entrances (`n`), floors per entrance (`m`), and apartments per floor (`k`).
   - It also takes the apartment numbers for Edward (`a`) and Natasha (`b`).
   - The output is the minimum time in seconds for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment.

2. **Calculating Floors and Entrances**:
   - The code calculates the floor and entrance (block) for both Edward and Natasha using:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - This part seems accurate according to the problem description for determining which floor and entrance the apartments belong to.

3. **Calculating Time**:
   - The program calculates the time to move between entrances using:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This correctly accounts for the circular nature of the building.

4. **Handling Floor Movement**:
   - The program calculates the time for moving between floors using:
     ```python
     if a_floor > b_floor:
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - However, this logic incorrectly adds a 10-second lift wait time regardless of whether Edward is going up or down. The wait time should only apply if he is using the lift to go down, not when he is going up.

5. **Potential Case of Incorrectness**:
   - Consider the following case:
     - Inputs: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`, `a = 1`, `b = 2` (not valid since `b` must be ≤ `n·m·k`).
     - Let's take a valid case: `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 2`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`.
     - According to the problem, Edward is in apartment 1 on the first floor of the only entrance, and Natasha is in apartment 2 on the same floor.
     - The expected output should be 0 seconds since they are on the same floor and entrance, but the program would incorrectly calculate a time based on the floor movement logic.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where both Edward and Natasha are on the same floor and entrance. Thus, it can produce incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
