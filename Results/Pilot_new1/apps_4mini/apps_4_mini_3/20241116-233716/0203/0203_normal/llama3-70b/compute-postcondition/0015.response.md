The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. The states of the other variables (`n`, `fractions`, and `fraction`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 3 characters remaining, `fraction` is the third character in the string, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.
