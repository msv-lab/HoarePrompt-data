The code snippet `print('D')` outputs the string 'D' to the console. It does not change the values of any of the variables `depublicans`, `remocrats`, or `fractions`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the action taken by the print statement.

Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`; 'D' is printed to the console.**
