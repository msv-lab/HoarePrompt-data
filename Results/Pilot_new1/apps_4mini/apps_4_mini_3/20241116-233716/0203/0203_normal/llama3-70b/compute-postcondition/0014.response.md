According to the code, the loop iterates over the characters in the string `fractions`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are characters remaining in the string. At the end of the last iteration, the string `fractions` has at least 2 characters remaining, and `fraction` is the second character in the string.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more character in the string after the current `fraction`. Since `fraction` is currently the second character, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `fractions` must have at least 3 characters remaining (the current character and at least one more).

The `fraction` will also need to be updated to the next character in the string, which will be the third character.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 3 characters remaining, and `fraction` is the third character in the string.**
