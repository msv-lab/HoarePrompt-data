According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string. Since `fractions` is a non-empty string and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will iterate over each character until all characters have been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that the loop has processed one character from `fractions`. To execute one more time, the loop must have at least one more character left in `fractions`. 

If `fractions` was of length `k`, then after processing one character, the remaining characters would be `k - 1`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `fractions` should have at least `k` characters, and the index of the current character being processed should be `1` (indicating the second character).

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with at least 2 characters remaining, fraction is the second character in the string, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
