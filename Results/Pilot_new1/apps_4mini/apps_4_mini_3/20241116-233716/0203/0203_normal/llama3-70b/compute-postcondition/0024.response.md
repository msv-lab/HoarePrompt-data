Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `fractions` is a non-empty string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed to the console. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, 'R' is printed to the console. This includes the case where `depublicans` and `remocrats` are equal, in which case 'R' is also printed.***
