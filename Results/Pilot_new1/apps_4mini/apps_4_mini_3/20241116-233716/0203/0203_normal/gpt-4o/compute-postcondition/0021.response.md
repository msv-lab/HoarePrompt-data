The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. The state of `r_queue` will change as it will lose its first element, but other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue`, and `r_queue` has one less element.**
