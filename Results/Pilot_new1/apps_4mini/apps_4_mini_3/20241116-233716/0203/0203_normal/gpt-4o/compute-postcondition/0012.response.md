The code appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 1, so after executing the code, `r_queue` will have 1 added to it. The values of the other variables (`n`, `votes`, and `v`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `r_queue` now contains the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`, and `r_queue` contains 1**
