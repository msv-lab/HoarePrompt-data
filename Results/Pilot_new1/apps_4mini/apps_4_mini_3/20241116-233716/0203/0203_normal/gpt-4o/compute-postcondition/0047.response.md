Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes these votes to determine the final outcome based on the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters. If there are remaining 'D' characters after processing, it prints 'D', otherwise it prints 'R'. If `n` is 0, no votes are processed and the function will not print anything. **
