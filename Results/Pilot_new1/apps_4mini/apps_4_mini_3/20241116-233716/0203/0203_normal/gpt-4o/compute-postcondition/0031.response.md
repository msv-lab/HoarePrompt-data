The code appends the value `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The previous value of `r_index` is known (it is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`), but the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the new element added to `r_queue` is dependent on the unknown value of `n`. The states of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `r_index` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the value of the removed element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the value of the removed element from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` now has an additional element `r_index + n`.**
