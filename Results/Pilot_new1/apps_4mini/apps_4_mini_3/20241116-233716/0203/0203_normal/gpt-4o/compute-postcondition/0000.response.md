The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and the variable `votes` is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `votes` remains a string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length n**
