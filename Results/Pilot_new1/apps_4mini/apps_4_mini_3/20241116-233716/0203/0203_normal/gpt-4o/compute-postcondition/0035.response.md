The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged before the operation. After executing the code, `r_queue` will have one less element, as the first element is removed, and `r_index` will hold the value of that removed element. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`**.
