The code appends the value of `i` to the `d_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `d_queue` will contain the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` is a list containing 0, `r_queue` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
