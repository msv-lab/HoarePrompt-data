The code appends the value of `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. The initial state indicates that `d_queue` has one less element, and `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`. Therefore, after executing the code, `d_queue` will have one more element, which is the sum of `d_index` and `n`. The values of `d_index`, `r_queue`, and `r_index` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has one more element with the value `d_index + n`, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, `r_queue` has one less element, and `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`**.
