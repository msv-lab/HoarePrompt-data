The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue`. The initial value of `i` is 2, so after execution, the `r_queue` will include the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of `votes`, and the value 2 has been appended to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of `votes`, and the value 2 has been appended to `r_queue`.**
