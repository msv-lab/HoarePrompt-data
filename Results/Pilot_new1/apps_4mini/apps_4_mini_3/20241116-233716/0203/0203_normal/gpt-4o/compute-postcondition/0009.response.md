Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length `n`, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `votes` (`v`) is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the index 0, and `r_queue` remains empty. If `v` is not 'D' (which includes the case where `v` is 'R' or any other character), then `d_queue` remains empty, and `r_queue` contains the index 0.***
