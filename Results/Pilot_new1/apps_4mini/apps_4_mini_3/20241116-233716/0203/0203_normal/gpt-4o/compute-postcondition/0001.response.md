The variable `votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which means it will take an input string and remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer and `votes` is a string of length `n`. Since the length of the string `votes` will now be determined by the input, the output state reflects that `votes` is now a string of length equal to the input value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `votes` is a string of length n (input string after stripping whitespace)**
