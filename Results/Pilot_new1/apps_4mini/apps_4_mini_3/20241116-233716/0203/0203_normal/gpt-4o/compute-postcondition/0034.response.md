The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. Since `d_queue` has one additional element which is `d_index + n`, the value of `d_index` will be the first element of `d_queue` before the pop operation. After this operation, `d_queue` will have one less element. The state of `r_queue` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is the first element of the original `d_queue`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged**.
