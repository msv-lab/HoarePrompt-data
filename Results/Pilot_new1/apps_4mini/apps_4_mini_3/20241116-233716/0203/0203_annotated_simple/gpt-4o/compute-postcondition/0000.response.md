The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the output state reflects that `n` now holds the value of the input integer. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000**
