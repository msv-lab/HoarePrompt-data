The variable `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue` by using the `pop(0)` method, which removes that element from `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` is non-empty, this operation is valid, and the first element is successfully removed and assigned to `d_index`. The state of `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `d_queue` and the assignment to `d_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `d_index` is the removed first element; `r_queue` is non-empty**
