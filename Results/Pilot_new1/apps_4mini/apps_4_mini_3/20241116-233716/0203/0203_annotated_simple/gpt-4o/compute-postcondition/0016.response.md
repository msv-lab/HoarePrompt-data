The code appends the value of `i` to `r_queue`. The value of `i` is 2, and since `r_queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, we can infer it is an empty list or not defined yet. Therefore, after the execution, `r_queue` will contain the value 2. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the character at index 2 of `votes`, and `r_queue` contains the value 2.**
