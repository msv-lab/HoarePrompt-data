The variable `r_queue` is assigned an empty list. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed by this assignment. The states of `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
