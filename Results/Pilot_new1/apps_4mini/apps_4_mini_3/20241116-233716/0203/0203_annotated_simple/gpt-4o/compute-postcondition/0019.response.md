Output State: **`d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` contains the indices of characters that are not 'D', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, and `votes` is a non-empty string. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty.**
