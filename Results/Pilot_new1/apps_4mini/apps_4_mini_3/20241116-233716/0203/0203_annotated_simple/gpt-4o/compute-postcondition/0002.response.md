The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000; `votes` is an input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `d_queue` is an empty list.
