The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes the votes in a way that simulates a competition between 'D' and 'R' characters based on their indices. If there are unmatched 'D' characters remaining after processing, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 200000, nor does it check if the input string `votes` is empty before processing.
