Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is a non-empty queue, `r_queue` can be either empty or non-empty. The loop will execute and process elements from `d_queue` against `r_queue` until one of the queues is empty. If `d_queue` becomes empty, all 'D' characters have been processed, and `r_queue` contains indices of unmatched 'R' characters. If `r_queue` becomes empty, all 'R' characters have been processed, and `d_queue` contains indices of unmatched 'D' characters.***
