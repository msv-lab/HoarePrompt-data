The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`, which is non-empty. The operation `pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue`, so after execution, `r_queue` will have one less element. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `d_index` is the removed first element; `r_queue` is non-empty with one element removed; `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is non-empty with the first element removed; `d_index` is the removed first element; `r_queue` is non-empty with one element removed; `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`.**
