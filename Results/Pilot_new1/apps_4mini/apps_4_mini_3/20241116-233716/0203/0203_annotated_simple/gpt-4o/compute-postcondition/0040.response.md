Output State: **If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty, the loop will execute until one of the queues is empty. After the loop, if `d_queue` is empty, it indicates that all 'D' characters have been processed against 'R' characters, and the remaining `r_queue` will contain indices of unmatched 'R' characters. Conversely, if `r_queue` is empty, it indicates that all 'R' characters have been processed, and the remaining `d_queue` will contain indices of unmatched 'D' characters. If either queue is initially empty, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain unchanged.**
