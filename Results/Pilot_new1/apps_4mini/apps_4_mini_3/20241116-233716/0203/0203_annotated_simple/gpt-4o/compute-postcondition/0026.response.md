Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is updated based on the comparison between `d_index` and `r_index`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has an additional element equal to `d_index + n`, while `r_queue` remains unchanged except for the removal of its first element, which is assigned to `r_index`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has a new element equal to `r_index + n` appended to it, and `d_queue` remains unchanged except for the removal of its first element. In both cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed element from `r_queue`.***
