Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` = 1) and `remocrats` remains 0. If the first character of `fractions` is 'R', then `depublicans` remains 0 and `remocrats` is incremented by 1 (resulting in `remocrats` = 1).***
