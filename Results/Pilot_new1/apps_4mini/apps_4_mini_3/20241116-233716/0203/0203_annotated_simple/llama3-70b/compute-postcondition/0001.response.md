The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which accepts a string from user input. The initial state indicates that `fractions` is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. Therefore, the value of `fractions` will be updated to whatever string the user inputs, but the length of the string will still be `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 200000`). The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `fractions` is updated to user input**.
