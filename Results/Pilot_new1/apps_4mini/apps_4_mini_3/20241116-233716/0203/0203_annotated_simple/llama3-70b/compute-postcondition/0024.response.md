Postcondition: ***`depublicans` and `remocrats` are the counts of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string `fractions`, respectively, and `n` is the length of `fractions` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, the output is 'D'. If `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, the output is 'R'. If `fractions` is an empty string, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0, and the output is 'R' since there are no 'D' characters.***
