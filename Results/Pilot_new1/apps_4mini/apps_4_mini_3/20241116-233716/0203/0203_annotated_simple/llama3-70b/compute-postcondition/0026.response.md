Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` representing the number of characters in the string `fractions`, followed by a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. If the input string is empty, it defaults to printing 'R'. The function does not handle any exceptions for invalid input or empty string cases explicitly, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
