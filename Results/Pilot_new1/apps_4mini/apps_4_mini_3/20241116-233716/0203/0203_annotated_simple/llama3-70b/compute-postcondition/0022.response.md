Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `n` is the length of `fractions` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). If `fractions` is an empty string, then both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.***
