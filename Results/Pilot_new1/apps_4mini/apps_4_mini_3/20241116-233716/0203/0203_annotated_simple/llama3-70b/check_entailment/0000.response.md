The provided program attempts to determine the outcome of a voting scenario based on the fractions of employees. However, upon reviewing the logic of the program, it does not correctly simulate the voting process as described in the problem statement.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. The program counts the number of employees from each fraction ('D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats).
2. It then simply checks which count is greater and prints 'D' or 'R' based on that comparison.

### Issue with the Logic:
The problem description states that the voting process involves employees denying each other the right to vote based on their strategic decisions. The program does not account for this dynamic interaction. Instead, it only considers the initial counts of 'D' and 'R' without simulating the actual voting and denying process.

### Counterexample:
Consider the case where the input is:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this scenario:
- Employee 1 (D) can deny Employee 2 (R).
- Employee 2 (R) can deny Employee 3 (D).
- Employee 3 (D) can deny Employee 4 (R).
- Employee 4 (R) can deny Employee 5 (D).

Following this sequence, the last employee eligible to vote would be one of the 'D's or 'R's depending on how they deny each other. The final outcome is not determined simply by counting the initial number of 'D's and 'R's.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly implement the voting logic described in the problem, it will fail to provide the correct outcome for many cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
