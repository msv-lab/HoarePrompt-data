The variable `depublicans` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `n` and `fractions` remains unchanged, as the code only assigns a value to `depublicans`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `depublicans` is 0**.
