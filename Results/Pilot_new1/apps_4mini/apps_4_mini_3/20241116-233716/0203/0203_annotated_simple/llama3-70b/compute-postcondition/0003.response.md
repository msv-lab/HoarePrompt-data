The variable `remocrats` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of all variables after executing the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000), `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, and `remocrats` is 0**
