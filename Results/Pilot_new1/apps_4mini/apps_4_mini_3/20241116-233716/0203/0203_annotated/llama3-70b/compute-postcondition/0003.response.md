The variable `remocrats` is initialized to 0. The other variables, `n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `remocrats` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
