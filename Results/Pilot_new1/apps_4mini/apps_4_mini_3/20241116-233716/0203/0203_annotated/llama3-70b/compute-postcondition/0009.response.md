Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, if the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` = 1 and `remocrats` = 0). Otherwise, if the first character is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 (resulting in `depublicans` = 0 and `remocrats` = 1).***
