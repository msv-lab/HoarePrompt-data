According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. For the loop to execute, the string must contain at least one character, which is guaranteed since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). 

At the start of the loop, the variable `fraction` will take on the value of the first character in the `fractions` string. Since `n` is positive, `fractions` will have at least one character, and `fraction` will be the first character in the string.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `fraction` is initialized to the first character of the `fractions` string. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character of `fractions`**
