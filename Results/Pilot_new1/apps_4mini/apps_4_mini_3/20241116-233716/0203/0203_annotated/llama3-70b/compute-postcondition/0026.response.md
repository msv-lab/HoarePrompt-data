Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (which represents the number of characters) and a string `fractions` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and any other character (remocrats) in the string. If the count of 'D' is greater than the count of 'R', it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or where `fractions` is empty, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such cases were to occur. **
