The variable `depublicans` is initialized to `0`. The values of `n` and `fractions` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, and `depublicans` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`, and `depublicans` is 0**
