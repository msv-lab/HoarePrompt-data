The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of employees, constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which indicate the fraction type for each employee. 

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the characteristics of the employees. However, the specific output behavior based on the inputs is not provided in the details. Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.**
