Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and `fractions` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000). If `n` is 0 (though not possible as per the initial state), the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `fractions` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` are also 0.**
