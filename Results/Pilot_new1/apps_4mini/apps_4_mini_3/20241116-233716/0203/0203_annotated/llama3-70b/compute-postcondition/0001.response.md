The variable `fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, which represents a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. The value of `n` is not affected by this assignment, and it remains a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `fractions` is an input string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is an input string of length `n`**
