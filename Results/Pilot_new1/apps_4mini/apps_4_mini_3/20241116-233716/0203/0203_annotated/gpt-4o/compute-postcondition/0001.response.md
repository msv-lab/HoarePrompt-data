The value of `votes` is assigned the value from `input().strip()`, which accepts input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, but the value of `votes` is now a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. Therefore, the output state reflects the new assignment to `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' (updated from input)**
