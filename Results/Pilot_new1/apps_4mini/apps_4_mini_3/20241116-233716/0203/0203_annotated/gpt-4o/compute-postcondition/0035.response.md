The operation `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` has at least 2 elements, it will still have elements after this operation. The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged, but `r_queue` will have one less element. The output state reflects the change in `r_queue` and the assignment to `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` has at least 1 element remaining, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the removed first element of `r_queue`.**
