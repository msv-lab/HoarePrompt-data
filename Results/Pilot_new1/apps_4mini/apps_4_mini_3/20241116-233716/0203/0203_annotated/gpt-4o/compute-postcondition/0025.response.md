The code appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` is the first element popped from `r_queue`, but since `r_queue` remains unchanged in terms of its elements, this means that `r_index` has a specific value based on that first element. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so we treat it as a variable. 

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated `r_queue` with the new element added, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element, `d_index` is assigned a value that is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` is updated with `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `r_queue`.**
