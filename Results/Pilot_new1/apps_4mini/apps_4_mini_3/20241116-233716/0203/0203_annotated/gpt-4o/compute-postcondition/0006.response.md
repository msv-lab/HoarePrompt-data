The `d_queue` list is modified by appending the value of `i`, which is currently 0. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated `d_queue` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `d_queue` is [0]; `r_queue` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `v` is 'D'**
