The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The value of `i` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` will range from 0 to 199,999. The state of `votes` and `v` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n - 1`; `v` is `votes[n - 1]`, and `d_queue` now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `n - 1`; `v` is `votes[n - 1]`, and `d_queue` now includes the value of `i`.**
