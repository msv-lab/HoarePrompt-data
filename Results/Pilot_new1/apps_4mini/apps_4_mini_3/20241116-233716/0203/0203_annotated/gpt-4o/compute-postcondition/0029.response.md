The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` is not empty, this operation will succeed, and the first element will be removed from `r_queue`. The state of `d_queue` and `d_index` remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is now one element smaller, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.

Output State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is now one element smaller, and `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
