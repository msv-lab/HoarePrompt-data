The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. No variables are changed or updated, and the program stops execution. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables before termination.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the output is 'No'.**
