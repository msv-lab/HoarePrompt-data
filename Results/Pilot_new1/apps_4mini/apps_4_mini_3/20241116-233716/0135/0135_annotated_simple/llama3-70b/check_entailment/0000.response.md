To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code against the problem description.

### Code Logic Breakdown:
1. The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.
2. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to track the distinct remainders.
3. It iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (inclusive).
4. For each integer `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by `i` using `n % i`.
5. It checks if this remainder is already in the `seen` set:
   - If it is, the program prints 'No' and exits, indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If it is not, the remainder is added to the `seen` set.
6. After the loop, if no duplicates were found, it prints 'Yes'.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations provided in the code accurately describe the logic and state of the program after the loop. They clarify that if `k` is at least 1, the `seen` set will contain the unique remainders of `n % i` for `i` from 1 to `k`.

### Edge Cases:
1. When `k = 1`, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is always 0. Thus, the output should be 'Yes'.
2. When `k = 2`, the remainders are `n % 1` (0) and `n % 2`. Since `n % 1` is always 0, the output will be 'No' if `n % 2` is not 0.
3. For larger values of `k`, if `n` is less than or equal to `k`, the remainders will include values from 0 to `n`, which are distinct.
4. If `k` is greater than `n`, then the remainders will include `0` (from `n % 1`) and other values, but since `n % n = 0`, it will lead to a duplicate.

### Testing Potential Cases:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 4`:
  - Remainders: `4 % 1 = 0`, `4 % 2 = 0`, `4 % 3 = 1`, `4 % 4 = 0`. Here, `0` appears multiple times, so the output is 'No'.
  
- For `n = 5` and `k = 3`:
  - Remainders: `5 % 1 = 0`, `5 % 2 = 1`, `5 % 3 = 2`. All distinct, so the output is 'Yes'.

- For `n = 10` and `k = 5`:
  - Remainders: `10 % 1 = 0`, `10 % 2 = 0`, `10 % 3 = 1`, `10 % 4 = 2`, `10 % 5 = 0`. Here, `0` appears multiple times, so the output is 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies when the remainders are distinct and when they are not. It handles various edge cases appropriately, including when `k` is less than, equal to, or greater than `n`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
