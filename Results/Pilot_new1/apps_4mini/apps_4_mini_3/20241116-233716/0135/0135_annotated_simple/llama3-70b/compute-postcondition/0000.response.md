The values of `n` and `k` are assigned using `map(int, input().split())`, which means they will take input from the user and convert them into integers. Since `n` and `k` are defined as integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\), the output state will reflect the new values of `n` and `k` after the input is provided. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\)**
