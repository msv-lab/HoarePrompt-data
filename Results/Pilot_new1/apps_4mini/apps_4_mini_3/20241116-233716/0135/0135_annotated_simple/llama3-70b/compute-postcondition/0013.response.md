Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^{18}\), `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` contains 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1. If `remainder` is found in `seen`, the output is 'No' and the program execution is terminated; otherwise, the program continues without any output.***
