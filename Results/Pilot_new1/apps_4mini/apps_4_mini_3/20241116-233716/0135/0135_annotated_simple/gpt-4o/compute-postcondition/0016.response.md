The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than `n`, the function does not return a value, and if `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` contains the distinct remainders of `n % i` for `i` from 1 to `k`. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` is empty.
- In Case 3, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, and if `k` is less than `n`, it will either not return a value or return 'Yes' based on the conditions described. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k. It returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n; if k is less than n, it does not return a value or returns 'Yes' based on the distinct remainders of n % i for i from 1 to k.**
