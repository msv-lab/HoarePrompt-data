To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to check if all remainders when dividing `n` by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`.

### Code Analysis:
The function `func_1(n, k)` does the following:

1. **Initial Check**: 
   - If `k >= n`, the function returns 'No'. This is correct because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainder when dividing by `n` (which is `0`) will be repeated for both `i = n` and `i = k` (if `k` is also `n`), leading to non-distinct values.

2. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The function initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to track distinct remainders.
   - It then iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i` for each `i`.
   - If the calculated remainder is already in the `seen_remainders` set, it returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct.
   - If the remainder is not in the set, it adds it to the set.

3. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases Considered:
- The function correctly handles the case when `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- It checks for duplicates efficiently using a set.

### Potential Issues:
Now let's consider if there are any potential cases where the program may fail. 

1. **When `k` is less than `n`**: 
   - The function should accurately compute the remainders for all `i` from `1` to `k`. 
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the remainders would be:
     - `10 % 1 = 0`
     - `10 % 2 = 0`
     - `10 % 3 = 1`
     - `10 % 4 = 2`
     - `10 % 5 = 0`
   - In this case, the function would return 'No' because `0` appears multiple times.

2. **When `k` is very large**: 
   - The function should still work efficiently due to the use of a set to track remainders, but we should ensure it does not lead to performance issues. However, since the loop is bounded by `k`, it will always terminate.

3. **Values of `n` and `k` at their limits**: 
   - The function handles the edge cases where both `n` and `k` are at their maximum value of `10^18` correctly since Python's integers can handle large values.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering potential edge cases, the function behaves correctly according to the problem description. It accurately checks for distinct remainders and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
