The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it checks the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder has been seen before (i.e., it is not unique), it returns 'No'. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'. Therefore, the function effectively checks if `k` is less than `n` and whether the remainders of the divisions are unique.
