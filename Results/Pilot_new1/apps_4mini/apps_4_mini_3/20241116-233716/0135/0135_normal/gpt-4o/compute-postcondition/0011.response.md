According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `k`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue executing.

Since `k` is already greater than or equal to 1, we do not need to modify it, but we need to ensure that it is at least 3 to allow for another iteration. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be 3.
- `k` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
