Let's analyze the provided code and problem description step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Provided Program:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
print(func_1(n, k))
```

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Check for `k >= n`:** The code correctly identifies that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders will not be distinct because `n mod n = 0` and `n mod 1 = 0`. Thus, it returns 'No'.
   
2. **Distinct Remainders:** If `k < n`, the function iterates through integers from `1` to `k`, calculating `n mod i` for each and checking if the remainder has been seen before. If a duplicate is found, it returns 'No'. If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values:** Consider `n = 1, k = 1`. The output should be 'Yes' because `1 mod 1 = 0`, and there's no other `j` to compare with.
2. **Large Values:** For `n = 10^18` and `k = 10^18`, the function will return 'No' due to the first condition, which is correct.
3. **Remainders for Small `k`:** For `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders will be `5 mod 1 = 0`, `5 mod 2 = 1`, and `5 mod 3 = 2`, which are distinct, and the function should return 'Yes'.

### Output Hints:
The hints state:
- The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- It checks for unique remainders when `k < n`.

### Validation Against the Output Hints:
The hints accurately describe the behavior of the function. The logic for checking distinct remainders is sound, and the handling of the case where `k >= n` is also correct.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the code and considering edge cases, the function appears to handle all specified scenarios correctly. There are no apparent logical flaws, and the output hints align with the expected behavior of the code.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly checks for distinct remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k`, adhering to the problem description.
