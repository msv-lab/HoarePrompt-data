According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4. Additionally, `k` must be at least 4 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, and `remainder` is either 0, 1, or 2.**
