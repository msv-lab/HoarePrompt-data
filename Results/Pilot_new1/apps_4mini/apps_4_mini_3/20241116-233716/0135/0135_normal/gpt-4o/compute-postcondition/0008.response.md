Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. If `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the function does not return anything, indicating that `remainder` is not a previously seen value.***
