Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to 1, then the loop executes at most k times, with `seen_remainders` containing the unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to k. If any `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set.**
