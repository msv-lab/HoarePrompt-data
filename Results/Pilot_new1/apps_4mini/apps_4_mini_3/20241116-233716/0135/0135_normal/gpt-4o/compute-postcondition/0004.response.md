According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `k + 1`. The current states of `n` and `seen_remainders` do not affect the execution of the loop. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `k` must be at least 1, and the variable `i` will start at 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
