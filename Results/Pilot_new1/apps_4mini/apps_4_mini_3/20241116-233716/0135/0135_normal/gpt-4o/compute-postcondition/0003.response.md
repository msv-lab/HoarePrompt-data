The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `seen_remainders` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
