The variables `n` and `k` are assigned values from the input, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the user's input, and they can be any integers within the specified range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are now assigned input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
