Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute k times, with `seen` containing all unique remainders of n divided by each integer from 1 to k. If any remainder repeats, the program will print 'No' and exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set.**
