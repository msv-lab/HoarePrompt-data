The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as it is defined without any input arguments. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are integers with the conditions that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The output of the function is not provided in the prompt, so we cannot determine the specific return value or the conditions under which it returns different values. 

Therefore, based on the information given, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly, but operates under the constraints that n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The specific return value is not provided.**
