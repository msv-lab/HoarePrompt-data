The value of `remainder` is added to the `seen` set. Since `remainder` is derived from `n % 3`, it can be either 0, 1, or 2 based on the value of `n`. The state of `seen` will now include the new value of `remainder`. Other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder` added to it, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is updated to `n % 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder` added to it, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is updated to `n % 3**
