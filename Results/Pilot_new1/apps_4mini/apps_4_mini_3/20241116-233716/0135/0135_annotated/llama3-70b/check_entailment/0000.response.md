To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description Recap:
The problem requires us to check if all remainders of `n` divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n % i = n % j`. 

### Code Analysis:
The provided code performs the following steps:
1. It reads two integers, `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the unique remainders.
3. It iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`.
4. If the calculated remainder has already been seen (exists in the `seen` set), it prints "No" and exits.
5. If all remainders are unique, it prints "Yes" after the loop.

### Annotations Review:
The annotations clarify the behavior of the function:
- It states that if `k` is at least `1`, the loop will execute up to `k` times, calculating the remainders.
- If `k` is less than `1`, the loop does not execute, and the set remains empty, leading to "Yes".

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `k = 1`:** 
   - The only remainder calculated is `n % 1`, which is always `0`. Hence, the output should be "Yes" because there are no pairs `(i, j)` to compare.
   
2. **Case when `k = 2`:**
   - The remainders would be `n % 1` (which is `0`) and `n % 2`. The output is "No" if `n` is even (since `n % 2` would also be `0`), and "Yes" if `n` is odd. The code does not handle this correctly since it will always print "Yes" when `k < 1`.

3. **General Case:**
   - The code correctly identifies duplicates for any `k >= 1` but does not handle cases where `k` is less than `1` correctly, as the output defaults to "Yes" without any checks.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `1` appropriately, which could lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the annotations mention that if `k` is less than `1`, the loop will not execute, and it will print "Yes", which is misleading because the problem states that `1 ≤ n, k`, making `k` less than `1` invalid.

Thus, there are scenarios where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. The program fails to account for cases where `k` is less than `1`, leading to potentially incorrect outputs.
