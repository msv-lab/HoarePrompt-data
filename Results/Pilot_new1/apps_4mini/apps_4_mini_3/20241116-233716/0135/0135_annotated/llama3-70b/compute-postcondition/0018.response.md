The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change as the program exits before any further execution can take place. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `seen` contains the value of `remainder` added to it, `i` is 3, `remainder` is updated to `n % 3`, and the output is 'No', and the program exits.
