Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute up to k times, calculating the remainder of n divided by i for each i from 1 to k. The set 'seen' will contain all unique remainders calculated during the loop. If any remainder is repeated, the loop will print 'No' and exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and 'seen' remains an empty set.**
