The variable `seen` is assigned a new empty set. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as this operation does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `seen` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `seen` is an empty set**
