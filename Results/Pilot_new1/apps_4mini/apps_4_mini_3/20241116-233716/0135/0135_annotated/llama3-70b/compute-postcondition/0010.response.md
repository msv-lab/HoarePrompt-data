The value of `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 2, so `remainder` will be the result of `n % 2`. The previous value of `remainder` was 0, but it will be updated to the new calculated value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is updated to `n % 2`**
