The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from the input, which consists of two integers separated by a space. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not specified, but they are integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` and `k` are now assigned specific input integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
