Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`. It returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it calculates the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k` and checks for duplicates. If any duplicate remainders are found, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function assumes that `k` is at least 1, as the loop will not execute for `k` less than 1, but this case is not explicitly handled in the code. **
