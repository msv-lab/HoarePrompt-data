The code initializes `seen_remainders` as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. The initial state indicates that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function would return 'No', but since the code snippet provided does not include any return statement, it does not affect the output state. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new initialization of `seen_remainders`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
