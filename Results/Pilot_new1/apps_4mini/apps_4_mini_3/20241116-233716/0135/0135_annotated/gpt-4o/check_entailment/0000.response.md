To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The task is to check if all remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to ensure that there are no pairs `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if (k >= n):
        return 'No'  # If k is greater than or equal to n, return 'No'
    
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'  # If a duplicate remainder is found, return 'No'
        
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    
    return 'Yes'  # If all remainders are unique, return 'Yes'
```

### Code Annotations:
1. The program returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
2. It checks for duplicate remainders and returns 'No' if any are found.
3. If no duplicates are found during the loop, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case when `k >= n`:** The program correctly returns 'No' because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders will not be distinct. For instance, `n mod n = 0` and `n mod 1 = 0`, which are duplicates.
   
2. **Case when `k < n`:** The program iterates from `1` to `k` and checks remainders. However, the crucial part is whether the remainders can be distinct. 

### Testing with Examples:
1. **Example Input:** `n = 4`, `k = 4`
   - Remainders: `4 mod 1 = 0`, `4 mod 2 = 0`, `4 mod 3 = 1`, `4 mod 4 = 0` → Duplicates found (0).
   - Output: 'No' (correct).

2. **Example Input:** `n = 5`, `k = 3`
   - Remainders: `5 mod 1 = 0`, `5 mod 2 = 1`, `5 mod 3 = 2` → All distinct.
   - Output: 'Yes' (correct).

### Potential Missing Logic:
- The program does not explicitly handle the case when `k` is `0`. While the constraints state `1 ≤ k`, if we were to consider an edge case where `k` could be `0`, the loop would not execute, and it would return 'Yes' without checking anything.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for the valid ranges of `n` and `k` given the constraints. However, it does not account for the case where `k` is `0`, which is not explicitly handled in the code comments or logic, even though the constraints suggest it won't happen.

Thus, since the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically for the edge case of `k = 0`), we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program would fail to provide a valid output if `k` were to be `0` (even though the provided constraints suggest it won't happen).
