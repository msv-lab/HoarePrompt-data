Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if either `(b - a) % c != 0` or `(b - a) / c < 0`, the function prints 'NO'. This covers all cases where `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is not equal to 0.***
