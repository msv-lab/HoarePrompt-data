Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, with `b` not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with a non-negative result when divided, 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed, which includes scenarios where `c` is not zero but either `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative.***
