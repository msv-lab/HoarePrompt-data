The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned based on the input provided, which is split into three integers. Since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the output state will reflect that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers based on the input.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input provided**
