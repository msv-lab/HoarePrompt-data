To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze both the code and the problem description thoroughly.

### Problem Description Analysis:
1. The sequence starts with the integer `a` and has a common difference `c`.
2. We need to check if the integer `b` appears in this sequence.
3. If `c` is zero, the sequence is constant (all elements are `a`).
4. If `c` is not zero, we can determine if `b` can be expressed as `a + n*c` for some non-negative integer `n`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The code checks if `a == b`, which is correct. If they are equal, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
   
2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The code checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding multiples of `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which ensures that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., not trying to reach a smaller `b` with a positive `c` or a larger `b` with a negative `c`).

### Edge Cases:
- The code handles the edge case where `c` is zero correctly.
- For non-zero `c`, it correctly checks divisibility and the sign of `(b - a) / c`.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints describe the behavior of the function accurately:
- They confirm that if `c` is zero, the function checks for equality between `a` and `b`.
- They also confirm that for non-zero `c`, the function checks for divisibility and the non-negativity condition.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic needed to determine if `b` is part of the sequence defined by `a` and `c`. It handles all edge cases as per the problem description and the output hints.

Therefore, after careful consideration of the code and the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly identifies whether `b` is part of the sequence for all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
