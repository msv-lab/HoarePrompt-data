Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are input integers, with `c` not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0, the output is 'NO'.***
