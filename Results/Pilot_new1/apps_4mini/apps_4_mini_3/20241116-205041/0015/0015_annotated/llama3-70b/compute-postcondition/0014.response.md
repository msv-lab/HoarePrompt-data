The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is an integer, and they are constrained such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. Since the output behavior of the function is not specified in the provided information, we cannot determine the return values or any specific case handling. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, each within the specified range. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters a, b, and c, each constrained between -10^9 and 10^9.**
