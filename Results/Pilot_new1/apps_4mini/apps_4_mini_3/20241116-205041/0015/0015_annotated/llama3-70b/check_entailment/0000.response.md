To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the annotations carefully.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a sequence defined by:
  - First element `s_1 = a`
  - The difference between consecutive elements is `c`, hence the sequence can be represented as:
    - `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for `i = 1, 2, 3, ...`
- We need to check if a given integer `b` appears in this sequence.

### Key Cases:
1. **When `c = 0`:**
   - The sequence does not change; all elements are equal to `a`.
   - Therefore, `b` can only appear if `a == b`.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The sequence can take the form of `a, a + c, a + 2c, ...`
   - For `b` to be in the sequence:
     - The difference `b - a` must be divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`)
     - Additionally, the result of the division `(b - a) / c` must be non-negative, which ensures we are looking at future elements in the sequence (i.e., `i` must be a positive integer).

### Code Analysis:
The provided code implements these checks correctly:
- If `c == 0`, it checks if `a == b` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
- If `c != 0`, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, printing "YES" or "NO" based on those conditions.

### Annotation Review:
The annotations provide a summary of the logic:
- They confirm that for `c = 0`, the output is "YES" if `a == b`, and "NO" otherwise.
- For `c != 0`, they correctly outline the conditions under which "YES" is printed.

### Edge Cases and Examples:
1. **Example 1:** Input `1 7 3`
   - Sequence: `1, 4, 7, ...` → Output: "YES" (Correct)
   
2. **Example 2:** Input `10 10 0`
   - Sequence: `10, 10, 10, ...` → Output: "YES" (Correct)

3. **Example 3:** Input `1 -4 5`
   - Sequence: `1, 6, 11, ...` → Output: "NO" (Correct)

4. **Example 4:** Input `0 60 50`
   - Sequence: `0, 50, 100, ...` → Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all specified cases and edge cases as outlined in the annotations. 

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
