Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9 and `c` is not equal to 0. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, if `(b - a)` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output is 'NO'.***
