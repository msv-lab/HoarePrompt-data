Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, the output is 'YES' if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This includes the edge cases where `c` is 0, or where the difference `(b - a)` is negative or not divisible by `c`.***
