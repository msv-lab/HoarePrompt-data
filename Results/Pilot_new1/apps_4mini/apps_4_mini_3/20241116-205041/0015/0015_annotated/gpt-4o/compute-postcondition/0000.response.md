The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values from the input after being converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, so they will be replaced by the input values. Therefore, the output state reflects that `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers based on the input values.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input values**
