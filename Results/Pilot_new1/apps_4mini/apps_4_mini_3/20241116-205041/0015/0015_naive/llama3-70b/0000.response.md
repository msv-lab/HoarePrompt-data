To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step.

The problem states that we need to check if a number `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence starting with `a` and having a common difference `c`.

The program provided is as follows:

```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Breakdown of the Logic:

1. **When `c == 0`:**
   - The sequence does not change, so all elements are equal to `a`.
   - If `a` equals `b`, the output is "YES".
   - If `a` does not equal `b`, the output is "NO".
   - This part is correct.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which means that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding `c` some number of times.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, ensuring that we are moving in the correct direction (i.e., `b` is reachable from `a` by adding `c` if `c` is positive, or subtracting `c` if `c` is negative).
   - This part is also correct.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **When `c` is positive and `b < a`:** 
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" since we cannot reach `b` from `a` by adding a positive `c`.
   
2. **When `c` is negative and `b > a`:**
   - The program correctly outputs "NO" since we cannot reach `b` from `a` by subtracting a negative `c`.

3. **When `c` is zero, but `a` is not equal to `b`:**
   - The program correctly outputs "NO".

4. **When `c` is zero, and `a` equals `b`:**
   - The program correctly outputs "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. There are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
