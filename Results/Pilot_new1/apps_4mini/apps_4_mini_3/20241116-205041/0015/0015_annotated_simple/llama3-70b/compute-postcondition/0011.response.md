The code prints 'NO', and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The conditions given in the initial state are satisfied, but they do not affect the output of the print statement. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is not equal to 0; the value of `(b - a) % c` is not equal to 0 or `(b - a) / c` is less than 0; and the program prints 'NO'.
