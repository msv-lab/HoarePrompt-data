The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state indicates that `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, with `c` not equal to 0, and that the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and is non-negative. The execution of the print statement does not change the values of the variables but produces an output. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of the division (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, and 'YES' is printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers; `c` is not equal to 0; the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of the division (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0; 'YES' is printed.**
