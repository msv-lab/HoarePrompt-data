Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is 0, the function prints 'YES' if `a` equals `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it prints 'YES' if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is non-negative; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This covers all scenarios including when `(b - a)` is negative, zero, or positive, as well as when `c` is positive or negative.***
