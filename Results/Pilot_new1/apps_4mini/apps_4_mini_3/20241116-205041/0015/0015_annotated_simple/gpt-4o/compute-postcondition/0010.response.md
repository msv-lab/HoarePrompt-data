The code snippet executes a print statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is not equal to 0, and the function prints 'NO'**.
