The code prints the string 'YES', which does not modify any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`. The initial state indicates that `b` is equal to `a`, but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified. The output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c` and acknowledges the print operation.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, `b` is equal to `a`, and 'YES' is printed.**
