According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. In order for the loop to execute again, `cubes` must have at least 4 lists. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 lists, and `cube` is the third list in `cubes`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least 4 lists, and `cube` should be the fourth list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 4 lists; `cube` is the fourth list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of digits from `cube`.**
