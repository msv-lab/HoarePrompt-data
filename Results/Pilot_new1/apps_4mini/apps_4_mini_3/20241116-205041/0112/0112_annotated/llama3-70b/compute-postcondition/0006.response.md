The `digits` variable is updated to include string representations of each digit from the `cube` list. Since `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we can infer that `cube` contains a finite number of digits. The operation `str(digit) for digit in cube` generates string representations of each digit in `cube`, and `digits.update()` adds these string representations to the `digits` set.

Assuming `cube` contains digits (e.g., [0, 1, 2]), the `digits` set will now include the string representations of these digits (i.e., '0', '1', '2'). Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 lists; `cube` is the second list in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of digits from `cube`.**
