The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the first occurrence of the string '0' from the list `digits`. Since it is stated that the string '0' is present in `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The state of the variable `cubes` remains unchanged, and the list `digits` will now not contain the string '0'. 

Therefore, the output state is: `cubes` is a list with at least 1 list, `digits` no longer contains '0'.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list with at least 1 list, `digits` no longer contains '0'**
