Output State: **`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`. If `digit` is found in any of the cube faces up to `n`, `found` is set to True. If `n` is 1, 2, or 3 and `digit` is not found in any of the cube faces, `used_cubes` remains unchanged with all values as False and `found` is False. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, it would be outside the specified bounds, which should not occur according to the initial state.**
