According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `digits` that has not been processed yet.

At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`. If `digit` is not found in any of the cube faces and `found` is False, it indicates that the loop has already processed the last `digit` in `digits`.

Since there is no specific information about the current value of `digit` or the length of `digits`, we can only conclude that for the loop to execute again, `digit` must be set to the next element in `digits`, and there must be at least one more element left in `digits`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that there is at least one more `digit` available in `digits` for the loop to run again.

State: **`used_cubes` contains boolean values indicating which cube faces have been used based on the presence of `digit` in `cube_faces`, found is False, and digit is the next element in `digits`, and `digits` has at least one more element**
