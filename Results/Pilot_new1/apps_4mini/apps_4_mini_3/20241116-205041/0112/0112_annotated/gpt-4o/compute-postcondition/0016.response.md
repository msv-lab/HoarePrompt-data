The code assigns `True` to the index `i` of the list `used_cubes`. Since `i` is 2, the third element (index 2) of `used_cubes` is set to `True`. The values of `n`, `digits`, and `digit` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated state of the `used_cubes` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is True**
