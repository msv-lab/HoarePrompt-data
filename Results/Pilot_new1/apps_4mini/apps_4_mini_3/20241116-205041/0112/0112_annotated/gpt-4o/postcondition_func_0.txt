The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list of `cubes` (which contains `n` lists of 6 integers each, with each integer ranging from 0 to 9). It returns an integer `x` that represents the highest number (from 0 to 3) that can be formed using the cubes, based on the results of the `can_form_number` function for the numbers 1, 2, and 3. If no numbers can be formed, it returns 0. The function does not validate the contents of `cubes` or check if `n` is within the specified range, which could lead to potential errors if the input does not conform to expected values.
