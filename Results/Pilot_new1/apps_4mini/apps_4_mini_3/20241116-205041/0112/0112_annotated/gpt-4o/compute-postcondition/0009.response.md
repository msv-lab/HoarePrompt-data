Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values initialized to False, `found` is False, and `i` is 0. If `used_cubes[0]` is False and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]`, then `used_cubes[0]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the loop. If `digit` is not in `cube_faces[0]` or `used_cubes[0]` is already True, the values of `used_cubes` and `found` remain unchanged.***
