The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, where `i` is 1. The `used_cubes` list has `n` boolean values initialized to `False`, so after the assignment, the second element (index 1) of `used_cubes` changes from `False` to `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `digits`, `digit`, `found`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the second element set to `True`, `found` is False, and `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values with the second element set to `True`, `found` is False, `i` is 1**
