According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the loop will execute at least once because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`. 

Before the loop starts, `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, which means the loop can execute accordingly. The initial value of `i` is 0 for the first iteration. The `digits` list has at least 1 element, and `digit` is set to the first element of that list. The `used_cubes` list has `n` False values, which is appropriate for tracking usage during the loop execution.

Therefore, to summarize the necessary states for the loop to execute:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` False values, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
