According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will iterate over each element in the `cubes` list. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 3 elements, and `cube` is the third element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `cube` needs to be the fourth element in the list, and the `cubes` list must have at least 4 elements.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 4 elements; `cube` is the fourth element in the `cubes` list; `digits` is updated with string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
