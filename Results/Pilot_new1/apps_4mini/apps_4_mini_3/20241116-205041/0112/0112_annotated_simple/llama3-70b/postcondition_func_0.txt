The function accepts an integer input `n`, representing the number of lists of integers (cubes) to be entered. It collects all unique digits from these lists, removes the digit '0' if present, and then constructs and prints the largest possible integer that can be formed from the remaining digits. If no valid digits remain after processing, the function will attempt to print an empty result, which may not be explicitly handled.
