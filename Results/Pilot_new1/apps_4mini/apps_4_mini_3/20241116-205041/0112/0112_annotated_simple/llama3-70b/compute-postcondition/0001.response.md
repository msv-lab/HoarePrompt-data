The variable `cubes` is assigned a list comprehension that creates a list of lists. The outer loop runs `n` times, which is an input integer in the range from 1 to 3. For each iteration, it takes input from the user, splits it into components, maps them to integers, and forms a list for that iteration. The exact structure of `cubes` will depend on the input provided during execution. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is an input integer and `cubes` is a list of lists based on that input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3; `cubes` is a list of lists based on user input.**
