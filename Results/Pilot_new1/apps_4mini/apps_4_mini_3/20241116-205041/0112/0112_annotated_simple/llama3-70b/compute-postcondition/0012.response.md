The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the element '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' is confirmed to be an element of `digits`, it will be successfully removed. The state of the other variables is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `digits` no longer contains '0'.

Output State: **`digits` no longer contains '0'**
