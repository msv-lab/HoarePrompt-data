According to the code, the loop iterates over the `cubes` list. For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be at least one more element in the `cubes` list beyond the second element that has already been processed.

At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 elements, and `cube` is the second element in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 3 elements, and `cube` needs to be updated to the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 elements, `cube` is the third element in the `cubes` list, and `digits` is updated with string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
