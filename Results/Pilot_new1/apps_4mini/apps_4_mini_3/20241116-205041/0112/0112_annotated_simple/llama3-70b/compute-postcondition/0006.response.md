The code updates the `digits` set with string representations of each digit in `cube`. The `cube` is the second element in the `cubes` list, and since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we can infer that `cubes` has at least 2 elements. The specific values of `cube` and `digits` are not provided, but we know that `digits` will be updated with new string representations.

Assuming `cube` contains integers, the set `digits` will now include the string representations of those integers. The previous state of `digits` is not specified, so we will indicate that it has been updated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 elements, `cube` is the second element in the `cubes` list, and `digits` is updated with string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
