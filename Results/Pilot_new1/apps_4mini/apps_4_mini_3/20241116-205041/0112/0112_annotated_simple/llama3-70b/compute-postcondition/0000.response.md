The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, but the specific value of `n` is not provided. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3**
