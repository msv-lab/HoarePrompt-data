According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `cubes` list. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 element, and `cube` is the first element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 2 elements, and `cube` should be updated to the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 elements, `cube` is the second element in the `cubes` list, and `digits` is updated with string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
