The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
