According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` collection. If the collection has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False and `digits` has at least one more element than what was processed in the previous iteration. 

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `digits` collection must have at least one additional element, and the `digit` variable should be updated to reflect the next element in the collection. If `digits` had at least one element before the last iteration, it should now have at least two elements.

State: **`found` is False, `digits` is a collection with at least two elements, `digit` is the next element in the collection**
