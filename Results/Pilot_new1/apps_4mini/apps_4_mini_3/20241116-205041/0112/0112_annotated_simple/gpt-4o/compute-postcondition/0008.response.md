The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
