According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and `i` is the current index of the loop iteration.

To determine the necessary adjustments:
- If `n` is currently 1, the loop cannot execute again because `i` would be equal to `n` after the last iteration.
- If `n` is currently 2, `i` would be 1 at the end of the last iteration, which allows for one more iteration.
- If `n` is currently 3, `i` would be 2 at the end of the last iteration, which also allows for one more iteration.

Since `n` can be 1, 2, or 3, and `found` is True, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again. If `n` is 1, it should be adjusted to 2. If `n` is 2, it should remain 2, and if `n` is 3, it should remain 3. Additionally, `i` should be incremented by 1 to reflect the next iteration.

Thus, the adjustments depend on the value of `n`:
- If `n` is currently 1, it becomes 2, and `i` becomes 1.
- If `n` is currently 2, `i` becomes 2.
- If `n` is currently 3, `i` becomes 3.

Since we need to ensure that the loop can execute again, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 2, and `i` needs to be updated to the next index.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, and `used_cubes[i]` is set to True if `used_cubes[i]` was initially False and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`. `i` is updated to reflect the next index.**
