According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, which means it can be either 2 or 3. 

Since `i` is currently less than `n` (because the loop has just completed an iteration), we need to determine the value of `i` after the last iteration to see if it can execute again. If `i` was 0 at the start of the loop, it would now be 1 after the first iteration. 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 2 (if `n` was 2) or keep it as is if `n` was 3. We also need to increment `i` to reflect that the loop has completed one iteration. 

Thus, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 to allow for another iteration, and we can set `n` to 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `i` is 2**
