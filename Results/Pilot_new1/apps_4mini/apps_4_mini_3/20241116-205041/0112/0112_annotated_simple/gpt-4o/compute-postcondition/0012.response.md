The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, but it was already `True` in the initial state, so there is no change in its value. The other variables (`n`, `digits`, `digit`, and `used_cubes[i]`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, and `used_cubes[i]` is set to True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True**
