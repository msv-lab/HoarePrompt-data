The code `digits.remove('0')` removes the string '0' from the set `digits`. Since the initial state specifies that '0' is included in `digits`, it will successfully be removed. The other elements in the set remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state reflects that '0' has been removed from `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of integers found in the lists of `cubes`, excluding '0'.**
