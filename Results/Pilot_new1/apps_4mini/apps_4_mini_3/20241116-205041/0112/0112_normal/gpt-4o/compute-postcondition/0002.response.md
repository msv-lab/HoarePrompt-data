According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least one element. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it does not directly affect the execution of the loop but indicates that the `used_cubes` list has a length that is valid for the context. 

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `digits` is not empty. At the start of the loop, `digit` will take the value of the first element in the `digits` list. 

Thus, the adjustments needed are to ensure that `digits` contains at least one digit, and `digit` is set to the first element of the `digits` list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False**
