The value of `found` is changed from `True` to `False`. The other variables `used_cubes` and `digits` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `found` is False, `used_cubes` is unchanged, and `digits` has at least one more element.

Output State: **`found` is False, `used_cubes` is unchanged, `digits` has at least one more element**
