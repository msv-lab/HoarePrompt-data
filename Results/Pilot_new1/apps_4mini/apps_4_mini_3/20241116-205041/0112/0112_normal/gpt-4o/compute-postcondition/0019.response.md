Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element; `digit` is the first element in `digits`; if `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, no changes are made to `used_cubes[i]` or `found`.***
