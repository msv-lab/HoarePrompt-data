Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of string representations of digits with at least 1 element, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, and `found` is set to True. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` remains True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[i]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]`, the values of `used_cubes` and `found` remain unchanged.***
