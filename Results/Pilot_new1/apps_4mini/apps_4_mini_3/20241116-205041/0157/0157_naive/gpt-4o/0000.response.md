To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

The problem requires calculating the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used in a compote, adhering to the ratio of 1:2:4. 

The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input, and then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of:
- The number of lemons available (`a`),
- Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), and
- A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`).

The total number of fruits used is then calculated as:
- `max_lemons * 1` (for lemons)
- `max_lemons * 2` (for apples)
- `max_lemons * 4` (for pears)

Finally, the program outputs the total number of fruits.

Now, let's consider a potential edge case:
1. Suppose Nikolay has 1 lemon, 1 apple, and 1 pear. According to the requirements, he cannot make any compote because he does not have enough apples or pears to meet the ratio. The expected output should be `0`. 
2. The program would calculate `max_lemons` as `min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4)`, which results in `min(1, 0, 0) = 0`. The total fruits calculated would be `0 * 1 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 4 = 0`. This is correct.

3. Now consider the case where Nikolay has 2 lemons, 5 apples, and 7 pears. The expected output is `7`, as he can use 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears. The program will calculate `max_lemons` as `min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4)`, which results in `min(2, 2, 1) = 1`. The total fruits calculated will be `1 * 1 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 4 = 7`. This is also correct.

4. For the input `4, 7, 13`, the expected output is `21`, as he can use 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears. The program calculates `max_lemons` as `min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4)`, resulting in `min(4, 3, 3) = 3`. The total fruits calculated will be `3 * 1 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 3 + 6 + 12 = 21`. This is correct as well.

Now, let's check if there are any other edge cases:
- If Nikolay has 0 lemons, apples, or pears, the program would still return `0` because `max_lemons` would be `0` due to the `min` function.

After analyzing various cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**.
