To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the requirements.

### Problem Requirements
Nikolay has:
- `a` lemons
- `b` apples
- `c` pears

The recipe requires:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

To make the compote, we need to find the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the available quantities.

### Code Analysis
The code provided is as follows:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. The function reads three integers from input, representing the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used by finding the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`)
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`) because each set requires 2 apples
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`) because each set requires 4 pears
3. It then calculates the total number of fruits used in the sets:
   - The total is computed as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

### Edge Cases
Let's consider some edge cases to see if the program handles them correctly:
- **Case 1**: When `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 4`. The output should be `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (correct).
- **Case 2**: When `a = 2`, `b = 5`, `c = 7`. The output should be `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (correct).
- **Case 3**: When `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`. The output should be `0` because there aren't enough pears (correct).
- **Case 4**: When `a = 4`, `b = 7`, `c = 13`. The output should be `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (correct).

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and checking various cases, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used to make the compote according to the given recipe. All edge cases and examples provided in the problem description yield the expected results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
