The function does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input three integers. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the input values, where `a` represents the number of whole lemons, `b` represents the number of fruits that can be used in pairs (2 fruits for each lemon), and `c` represents the number of fruits that can be used in groups of four (4 fruits for each lemon). The total number of fruits produced is then calculated and printed. However, the function does not return any value; it only outputs the total number of fruits through a print statement.
