To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact of the code on the variables involved.

1. `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are all input integers, meaning they can take on any integer values provided by the user.
3. The expression `b // 2` calculates the integer division of `b` by 2.
4. The expression `c // 4` calculates the integer division of `c` by 4.
5. The final value of `max_lemons` will be the smallest of the three computed values.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, the output state will reflect that `max_lemons` is determined based on the minimum of these calculated values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
