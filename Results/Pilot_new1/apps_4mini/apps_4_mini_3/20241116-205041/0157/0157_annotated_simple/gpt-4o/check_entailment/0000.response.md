To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic in the context of the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
Nikolay has:
- `a` lemons
- `b` apples
- `c` pears

The required ratio for making compote is:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

We need to find the maximum number of whole fruits that can be used while maintaining this ratio. If it's not possible to use any fruits, the output should be 0.

### Program Logic:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
    print(total_fruits)
```

1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates `max_lemons`, which is the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits:
   - `a` (number of lemons)
   - `b // 2` (since each lemon requires 2 apples)
   - `c // 4` (since each lemon requires 4 pears)
3. It then calculates `total_fruits` based on `max_lemons`:
   - For each lemon, it adds 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used.

### Analysis of Logic:
- The calculation of `max_lemons` is correct because it ensures that the number of fruits used does not exceed the available counts while respecting the required ratios.
- The total number of fruits is calculated correctly as `max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider some edge cases:
1. **Minimum Input Values**: 
   - Input: `1`, `1`, `1`
   - Output: `0` (correct, as not enough fruits)
   
2. **Insufficient Apples**:
   - Input: `3`, `2`, `10`
   - Expected Output: `0` (only 1 lemon can be used, which needs 2 apples)
   - Actual Output: `0` (correct)

3. **Insufficient Pears**:
   - Input: `3`, `10`, `3`
   - Expected Output: `0` (only 0 lemons can be used due to lack of pears)
   - Actual Output: `0` (correct)

4. **Exact Ratios**:
   - Input: `4`, `8`, `16`
   - Expected Output: `28` (can use all fruits)
   - Actual Output: `28` (correct)

5. **Exceeding Fruits**:
   - Input: `10`, `20`, `40`
   - Expected Output: `70` (can use all fruits)
   - Actual Output: `70` (correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program against the problem description and considering various edge cases, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits based on the given constraints and ratios. There are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
