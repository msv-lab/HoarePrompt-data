To determine the output state, we first analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

Now, we calculate `total_fruits` using the formula:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

This simplifies to:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4) = max_lemons * 7
```

The value of `max_lemons` is determined based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since `max_lemons` is defined as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, we can say that `total_fruits` will be `7 * max_lemons`.

Therefore, the output state will include:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
- `total_fruits` is `7 * max_lemons`

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons**
