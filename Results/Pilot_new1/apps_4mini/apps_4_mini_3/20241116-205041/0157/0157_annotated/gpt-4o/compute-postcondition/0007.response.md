Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs representing the quantities of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the constraints of using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears for each lemon, and then computes the total number of fruits based on that maximum. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits. Note that the function does not return any value; it simply outputs the result. **
