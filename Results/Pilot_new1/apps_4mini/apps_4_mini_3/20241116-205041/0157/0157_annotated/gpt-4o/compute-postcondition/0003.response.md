To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its effect on the initial state.

1. The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among three expressions: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The initial state specifies that `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, meaning their specific values are not defined but they are integers provided by the user.

Since `max_lemons` is determined by the minimum of these three values, we can express the output state in terms of the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is a new input integer, and `max_lemons` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
