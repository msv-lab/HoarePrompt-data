To determine the output state, we first need to evaluate the expression for `min_lemon`. 

`min_lemon` is defined as the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers with the constraints provided, `min_lemon` will take on the smallest value among these three.

The code then calculates the following expression:
```
min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4
```
This can be simplified to:
```
min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7
```

Since the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, we cannot compute an exact numerical result. However, we can describe the output state based on the calculation.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer within 1 to 1000, `c` is a new positive integer within 1 to 1000; `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`; the printed result is `min_lemon * 7`.**
