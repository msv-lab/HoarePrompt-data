The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `b` and `c` are within the range of 1 to 1000, so `b // 2` and `c // 4` will yield integers that are also within the ranges of 1 to 500 and 1 to 250, respectively. The exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, but they are integers within the given constraints. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer within 1 to 1000, `c` is a new positive integer within 1 to 1000; `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
