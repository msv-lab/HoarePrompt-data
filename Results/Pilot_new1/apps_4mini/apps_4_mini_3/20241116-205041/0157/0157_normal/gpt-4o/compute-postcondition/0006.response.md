The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraint that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not specify an output in the provided information, so we cannot describe the return value or behavior based on the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept three positive integers representing quantities of fruits.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000.**
