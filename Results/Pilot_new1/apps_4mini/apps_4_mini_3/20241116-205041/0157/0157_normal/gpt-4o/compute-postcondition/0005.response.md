To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`
- `total_fruits` is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`

The code snippet is:
```
print(total_fruits)
```

1. The variable `max_lemons` is computed based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Specifically, it takes the minimum of `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`.
2. The variable `total_fruits` is then computed as 7 times the value of `max_lemons`.
3. The `print` statement outputs the value of `total_fruits`.

Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, we cannot determine their exact values, but we know they are integers. The calculations for `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` depend on these inputs.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the relationships established by the calculations without specifying exact numeric values.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons**
