To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the components.

### Problem Description:
Nikolay has a certain number of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c). The recipe requires fruits in the ratio:
- 1 lemon
- 2 apples
- 4 pears

The goal is to determine the maximum total number of fruits he can use to make the compote.

### Program:
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers from input, which represent the quantities of lemons, apples, and pears. The problem specifies that these values will be positive integers between 1 and 1000. However, the program does not explicitly handle invalid inputs or check if they fall within the specified range.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons**:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` correctly computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears. This is in line with the requirement that for each lemon, there must be exactly 2 apples and 4 pears.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**:
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` correctly calculates the total number of fruits used based on the maximum number of lemons.

### Edge Cases:
- **Minimum Inputs**: If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 1`, the output should be 0 because there aren't enough apples or pears to make any compote.
- **Invalid Inputs**: The program does not handle cases where inputs are out of the specified range (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000), although the problem guarantees valid inputs. If inputs were invalid, the program would still run without error but yield incorrect results.

### Output Hints:
The output hints describe that the function calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made and subsequently the total number of fruits used. This aligns with the code's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote according to the ratios provided in the problem description. However, it does not handle invalid inputs or check for edge cases like when there are not enough pears or apples to make any compote, which could lead to incorrect behavior if invalid inputs were provided.

Despite the lack of input validation, since the problem guarantees valid inputs, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements as described.

Correctness: **True**.
