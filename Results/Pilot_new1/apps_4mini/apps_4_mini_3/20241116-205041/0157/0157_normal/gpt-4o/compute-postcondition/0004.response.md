To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we first need to understand the initial state and the effect of the code on the variables.

Initial State: 
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is an input integer
- `c` is an input integer
- `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`

The code snippet provided is:
```
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
```

1. The variable `max_lemons` holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The calculation for `total_fruits` is performed using the value of `max_lemons`. Specifically, it calculates `total_fruits` as:
   - `max_lemons * 1` (which is just `max_lemons`)
   - `max_lemons * 2`
   - `max_lemons * 4`
3. Therefore, `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons + 2 * max_lemons + 4 * max_lemons`, which simplifies to `7 * max_lemons`.

The output state will reflect the values of the variables after this calculation, including the computed `total_fruits`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4), `total_fruits` is 7 * max_lemons**
