Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, or if the range is empty, the loop does not execute, and `total_sum` remains 0. If `k` is outside the range 1 to 10, it may also lead to cases where the function does not operate as expected, but the loop will still execute with `total_sum` unchanged if no valid `num` meets the criteria.**
