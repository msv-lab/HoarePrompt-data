According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop will execute for each integer `num` starting from `l` up to and including `r`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `r` is greater than its previous value, meaning it has been updated and is now greater than the initial value of `r` before the loop started. Since `num` iterates from `l` to `r`, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` must be adjusted to reflect that the last value of `num` was `r`, and we need to ensure that `r` is now greater than the previous maximum value of `num`.

Since `num` will take the value of `r` in the last iteration, in the next iteration, `num` should be `r + 1`, which means `r` needs to be adjusted to be at least `r + 1`. The value of `l` and `k` remain unchanged as per the given state.

State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is greater than its previous value, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is unchanged**
