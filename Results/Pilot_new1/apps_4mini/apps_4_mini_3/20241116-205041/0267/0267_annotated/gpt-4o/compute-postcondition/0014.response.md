The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. After executing the function body, it calculates the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, and then returns this sum modulo `MOD`. If no valid `num` meets the criteria, or if the range is empty, the function returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` defining a range and an integer `k`, and return the sum of integers in that range that satisfy a certain condition, or 0 if no such integers exist. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters l and r defining a range, and k as an integer, and returns the sum of all integers in the range from l to r for which func_1(num, k) returns true, modulo MOD. If no valid integers meet the criteria, or if the range is empty, it returns 0.**
