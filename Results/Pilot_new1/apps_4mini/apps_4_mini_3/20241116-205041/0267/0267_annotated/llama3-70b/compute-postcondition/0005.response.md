Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair (n, k) exists in the data structure `dp`, the function returns the value associated with that pair. If (n, k) is not found in `dp`, there is no specified return value.***
