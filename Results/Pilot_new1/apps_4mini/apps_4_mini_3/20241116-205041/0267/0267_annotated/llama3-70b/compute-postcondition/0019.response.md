The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulus with `MOD`. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9, and after the operation, it remains 9 since 9 modulo any number greater than 9 will still be 9. If `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` would be updated based on the previous calculation, but the exact value isn't specified here. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is dependent on the value of `k`.

Output State: **if `k` is 1 then `dp[n, k]` is 9; if `k` is greater than 1 then `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the calculation, and `l` and `r` remain unchanged**
