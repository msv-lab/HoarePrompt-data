Postcondition: ***`l`, `r`, `n`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair (n, k) exists in the data structure `dp`, the function returns the value associated with that pair. If `n` is less than 10 ** k, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`. If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is set to 9. If `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated based on a specific calculation involving powers of 10, and both `l` and `r` remain unchanged. If (n, k) is not found in `dp`, there is no specified return value.***
