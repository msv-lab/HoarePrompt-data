Functionality: ** The function `count` accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a dictionary `dp`. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair `(n, k)` exists in `dp`, it returns the associated value. If `(n, k)` is not found in `dp`, it calculates a value based on the conditions provided and updates `dp` accordingly before returning the value associated with `(n, k)`. The function does not handle cases where `k` is greater than 10 or where `n` is negative, which could lead to unexpected behavior.**
