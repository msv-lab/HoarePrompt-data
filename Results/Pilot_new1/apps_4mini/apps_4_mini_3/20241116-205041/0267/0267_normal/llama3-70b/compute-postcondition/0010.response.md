According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k-1`, which means it will execute if `k` is at least 2 (since the range is exclusive of the upper limit). Given that `k` is constrained to be between 1 and 10, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to `k-1`. Since `dp[n, k]` is already 9, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `k` is at least 2, and we can set `i` to 1 (the first value in the range).

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is now 9, `i` is 1**
