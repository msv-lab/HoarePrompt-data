According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i < k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be equal to `k - 1` for the loop to have executed completely. Since `k` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is currently `k - 1`, the loop cannot execute again.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `k - 1`, which means that `i` should be adjusted to `k - 1` and `k` should remain unchanged, as it is already within the specified range.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be adjusted to `k - 1`.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10, `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, `dp[n, k]` is 9 * 10, `i` is k - 1**
