The expression updates `dp[n, k]` by adding a specific calculated value to it. The variables involved in the calculation are `n`, `k`, and `i`. The value of `i` is `k - 2`, and since `k` is between 2 and 10, `i` will be between 0 and 8. The term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` is multiplied by `(10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), it does not affect the calculation of `dp[n, k]` directly but indicates that `dp` is indexed by a sufficiently large number. 

The output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[n, k]` after the addition, but since we do not have the initial value of `dp[n, k]`, we will only state that it has been updated based on the calculation.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated based on the expression, where `i` is `k - 2`.**
