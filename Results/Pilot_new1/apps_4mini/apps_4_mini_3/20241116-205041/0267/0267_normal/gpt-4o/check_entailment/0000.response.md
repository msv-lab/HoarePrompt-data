To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both functions and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The result should be printed modulo `998244353`.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function 1**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n, k):
       return len(set(str(n))) <= k
   ```
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`. 
   - The output hints correctly describe this behavior. However, the hint mentions that it does not handle cases where `k` is negative. While `k` is constrained to be at least `1` in the problem description, the function could still be problematic if `k` were to be incorrectly set to a negative value in a different context.

2. **Function 2**:
   ```python
   def func_2(l, r, k):
       total_sum = 0
       for num in range(l, r + 1):
           if func_1(num, k):
               total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
       return total_sum
   ```
   - This function sums all integers from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns `True`, and returns the sum modulo `MOD`.
   - The output hints confirm that it correctly handles the summation and modulo operation.

### Edge Cases:
- One potential edge case is when `l` and `r` are equal. The function should still work and return the number itself if it meets the digit condition.
- Another edge case is when `k` is set to a value that makes it impossible to have any valid numbers in the range. For example, if `k = 0`, no number can have 0 unique digits. However, this is not applicable since `k` is guaranteed to be at least `1` in the problem statement.
- The program assumes that `l` is always less than or equal to `r`, as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The functions appear to work correctly based on the problem description and the output hints. They handle the summation of numbers correctly, and the conditions for counting unique digits are accurately implemented. The only minor issue is that if `k` were to be negative, it would lead to unexpected behavior, but this is not a concern given the constraints.

Since I cannot find a case where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
