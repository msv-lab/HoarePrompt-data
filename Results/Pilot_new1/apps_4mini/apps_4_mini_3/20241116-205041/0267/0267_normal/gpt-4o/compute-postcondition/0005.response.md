According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `l` and `r` are such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, meaning the loop has executed for the current value of `num` which is `r`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be incremented to `r + 1`, which is outside the current bounds of the loop. Therefore, `l` needs to be adjusted to `r + 1` to allow for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `l` is adjusted to `r + 1`.
- `r` does not need to change, as it still satisfies the condition 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18.

State: **`l` is `r + 1`, `r` is unchanged, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is initialized to 0**
