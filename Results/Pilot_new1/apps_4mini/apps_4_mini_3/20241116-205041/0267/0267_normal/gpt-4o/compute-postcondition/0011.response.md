According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `r`, which implies that the range for the loop is effectively just one value, `l` (or `r` since they are equal). 

Since the loop has completed its iteration over the range, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented to `r + 1`, which is the next number after `r`. Therefore, the state for the next iteration needs to reflect that `l` is now greater than `r`.

State: **`l` is equal to `r + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `k` is an integer in the range 1 to 10, `total_sum` remains 0**
