Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`. It calculates the sum of all integers `num` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) for which the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true, and returns this sum modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0 as the loop does not execute. If no integers in the specified range satisfy the condition, the function also returns 0. **
