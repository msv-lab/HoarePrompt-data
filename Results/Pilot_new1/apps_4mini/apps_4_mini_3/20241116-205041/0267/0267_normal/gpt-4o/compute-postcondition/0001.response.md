According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` are integers such that \(1 \leq l \leq r < 10^{18}\), this condition is already satisfied. 

The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0, but this does not affect the loop execution. The variable `num` will start at `l` and will increment until it reaches `r`. 

Since the current state indicates that the loop can execute, the only states that need to be explicitly mentioned are the starting values for `num`, which will be `l`.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
