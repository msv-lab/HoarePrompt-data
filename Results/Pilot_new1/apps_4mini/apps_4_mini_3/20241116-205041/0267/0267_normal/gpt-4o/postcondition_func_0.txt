The function accepts an integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns `True` if the number of unique digits in `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns `False`. It does not handle cases where `k` is negative, which may lead to unexpected behavior since the concept of unique digits cannot be less than zero.
