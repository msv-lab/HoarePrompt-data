Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`. It returns the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` inclusive for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, calculated modulo `MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the function returns 0, and if no integers in the range satisfy the condition, it also returns 0. **
