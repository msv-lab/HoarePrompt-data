Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. `n` is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the tuple (n, k) exists in the dp collection, the function returns the associated value; otherwise, the function does not return any value.***
