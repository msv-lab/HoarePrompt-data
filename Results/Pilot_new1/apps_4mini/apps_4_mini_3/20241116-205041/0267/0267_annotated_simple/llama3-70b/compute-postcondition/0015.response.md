The expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` updates the value of `dp[n, k]`. Given that `k` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1, we can calculate the components of the expression:

1. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)`: Since `i` is 1, this becomes `10 ** (1 - 1)`, which equals `10 ** 0`, resulting in `1`.
2. Calculate `10 ** (k - i)`: This becomes `10 ** (k - 1)`.
3. Calculate `10 ** (i - 1)` again, which is still `1`.

Substituting these values into the expression:
- The term `9 * 10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `9 * 1`, which is `9`.
- The term `(10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` simplifies to `(10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`.

Thus, the entire update for `dp[n, k]` becomes:
```
dp[n, k] += 9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
```

This means `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)` to its current value.

The output state reflects that `dp[n, k]` has been updated based on the above calculation, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * (10 ** (k - 1) - 1)`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
