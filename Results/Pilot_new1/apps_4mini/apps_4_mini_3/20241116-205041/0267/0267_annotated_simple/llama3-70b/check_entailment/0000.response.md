To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and its annotations based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
The goal is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that contain at most `k` different digits and return the sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function calls `count(r, k, dp)` and `count(l - 1, k, dp)`, and returns their difference modulo `MOD`.
   - The intention here is to count the numbers that satisfy the digit condition in the ranges `[1, r]` and `[1, l-1]`, and then subtract them to get the count in `[l, r]`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - If `k == 0`, it returns `0`, which is correct since no number can have 0 different digits.
   - It checks if the result for `(n, k)` is already computed and stored in `dp`. If so, it returns that value.
   - If `n < 10 ** k`, it assigns `dp[n, k] = n`, which seems to imply that all numbers from `1` to `n` are valid since they can all be formed with at most `k` digits.
   - For larger `n`, it initializes `dp[n, k]` to `9` and performs a calculation based on the number of digits and `k`. However, the logic here is not clear and may not correctly count the numbers with at most `k` different digits.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Counting Logic**: The logic for counting numbers with at most `k` different digits is not clearly defined, especially for cases where `n` is significantly larger than `10^k`. The current implementation might not correctly handle the distribution of digits and could miss valid numbers or count invalid ones.
  
2. **Edge Cases**: The program does not seem to handle edge cases where `l` and `r` are very close to each other or when `k` is at its maximum value. For instance, if `l = 1`, `r = 10^18`, and `k = 10`, it should theoretically include all numbers, but the counting logic might fail.

3. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo `998244353`, but if the counting function does not return the correct counts, the final sum will also be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Given the uncertainties in the counting logic for large values of `n` and the potential for missing valid numbers or incorrectly counting them, I can conclude that the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**
