According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `k`. The loop is set to iterate for `i` in the range from `1` to `k - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than `i`, which is currently `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1` (the last value it can take in the range). For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be greater than `k - 1`, which means `k` needs to be at least `k`. 

Thus, the only adjustment needed is that `k` must be greater than `1` because `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `k - 1`. 

State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10`, `k` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
