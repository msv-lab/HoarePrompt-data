Output State: **`if 'a' is present in the string s then res` is the string 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, and `s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b'. If 'a' is not present in `s`, the loop won't execute, and `res` will remain an empty string with `s` unchanged. After the loop finishes, `s` will no longer contain 'a', and `res` will contain the same number of 'a's as were originally in `s`. If there are no 'a's in `s`, `res` will be an empty string and `s` will remain unchanged.**
