Output State: **`if char is present in the string s then res` is the string 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, and `s` will have all occurrences of 'char' replaced by the next characters in ASCII until `char` is no longer present in `s`. If `char` is not present in `s` initially, the loop won't execute and `res` will remain as the string 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, while `s` will remain unchanged. If `char` is not a valid character (e.g., if it's the last character in ASCII), the loop may not execute as expected.**
