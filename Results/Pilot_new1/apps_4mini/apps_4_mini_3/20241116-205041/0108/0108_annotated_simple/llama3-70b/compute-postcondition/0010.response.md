The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is 'aa', and `char` is 'a'. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'aaa'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` contains 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
