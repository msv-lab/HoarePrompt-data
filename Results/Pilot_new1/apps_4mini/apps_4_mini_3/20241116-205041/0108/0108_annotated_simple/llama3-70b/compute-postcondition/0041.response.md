The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` to the console. The variables `res` and `s` remain unchanged and are not affected by this print operation. Therefore, the output state remains focused on the values of `res` and `s`, while also indicating that `-1` has been printed.

Output State: **`res` is a string that contains fewer than 26 characters, `s` remains unchanged, and -1 has been printed.**
