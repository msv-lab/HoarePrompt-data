According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the string `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been updated by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in ASCII. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the updated string `s`.

Since `s` is updated by replacing `char`, it is possible that `char` is no longer present in `s` after the last iteration. Therefore, to ensure that the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `char` is still in `s` after the replacement.

State: **`res` is the string 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, `s` must contain `char`**
