The variable `res` is assigned the value of `res + char`, which means we are appending `char` to the existing string `res`. Since `res` is initially the string 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s`, the value of `res` will increase by the value of `char`. The state of `s` is not directly affected, but the output state reflects the new value of `res`.

Output State: **`res` is 'a' repeated as many times as there are 'a's in the original `s` plus `char`, `s` must contain `char`**
