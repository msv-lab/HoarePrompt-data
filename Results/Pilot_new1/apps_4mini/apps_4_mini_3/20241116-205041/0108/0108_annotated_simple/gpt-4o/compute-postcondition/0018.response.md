Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`, and `j` is 26 if `s` contains all characters from `target`. If `s` is empty, then `i` is 0 and `j` is 0. If `s` does not contain all characters from `target`, then `i` is the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26.***
