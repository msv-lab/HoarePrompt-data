Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. While it checks if the string `s` contains all the characters of the English alphabet as a subsequence, it fails to account for the requirement that characters can be replaced with their next character in the alphabet.

For instance, consider the input string `abcxyz`. The program would recognize that `abcxyz` does not contain the full sequence of the alphabet as a subsequence, thus it would output `-1`. However, it is possible to transform this string into `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` by changing `x`, `y`, and `z` to `d`, `e`, and `f`, respectively, through the allowed character replacements.

Since the program does not consider the ability to modify characters to achieve the desired subsequence, it does not fulfill the problem requirements correctly. Thus, the program is incorrect.
