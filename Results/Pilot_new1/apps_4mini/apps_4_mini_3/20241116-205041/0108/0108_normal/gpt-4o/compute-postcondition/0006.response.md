Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to 'a', then `j` is incremented to 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not 'a', `j` remains 0. This accounts for the case where `s[i]` is the first character of `target` and also considers the situation where it is not, ensuring that `j` reflects the position of the matched characters in `target` accordingly.***
