Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks if it contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order. If it does, it attempts to print the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; however, this will lead to a NameError since `target` is not defined in the print statement. If `s` does not contain all letters, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, and the print statements may cause errors in certain cases. **
