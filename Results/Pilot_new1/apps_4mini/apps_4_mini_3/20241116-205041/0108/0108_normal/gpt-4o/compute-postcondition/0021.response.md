The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The initial state indicates that `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', which implies that the condition for `i` being equal to the length of `s` is not met. The variables `j` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z', `j` is less than 26, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and the function prints -1**
