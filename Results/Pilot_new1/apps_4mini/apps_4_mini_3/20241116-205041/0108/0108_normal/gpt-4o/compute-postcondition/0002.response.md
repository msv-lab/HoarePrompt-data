The variable `target_len` is assigned the value of `len(target)`, which calculates the length of the string `target`. The string `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which has a length of 26. Therefore, `target_len` will be 26. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26**
