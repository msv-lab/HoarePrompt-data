The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown as it is stated to be less than 26. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is less than 26 and `j` is increased by 1.**
