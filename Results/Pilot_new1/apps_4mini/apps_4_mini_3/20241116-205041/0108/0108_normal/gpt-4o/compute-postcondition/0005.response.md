The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` was initially 0, after execution, `j` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; the character at index `i` of `s` is equal to the character at index `j` of `target`, which is still 'a'.
