The `res` variable is updated by appending `char` to its current value. Since `res` already contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s`, the addition of `char` will simply extend `res` with `char` at the end. The value of `s` is not directly affected, and we know that `char` is already part of `s` since it has at least one occurrence of `char`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `res` after the addition of `char`.

Output State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char` (with `char` appended to `res`)**
