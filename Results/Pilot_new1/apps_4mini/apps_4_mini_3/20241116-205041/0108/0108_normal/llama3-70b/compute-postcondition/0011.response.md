The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` (which is 'b') in the string `s` with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. The ASCII value of 'b' is 98, and the character that follows it is 'c' (ASCII value 99). 

Given the initial state:
- `s` is the original string before the replacement.
- `char` is 'b'.

After executing the code, the first occurrence of 'b' in `s` is replaced with 'c', resulting in a new value for `s`.

The variable `res` is not affected by this operation, and its value remains 'abb'.

Thus, the output state after running the code will be:
- `s` has been modified to reflect the replacement of the first 'b' with 'c'.
- `res` remains 'abb'.
- `char` remains 'b'.

Output State: **`s` is the modified string with the first 'b' replaced by 'c'; `res` is 'abb'; `char` is 'b'**
