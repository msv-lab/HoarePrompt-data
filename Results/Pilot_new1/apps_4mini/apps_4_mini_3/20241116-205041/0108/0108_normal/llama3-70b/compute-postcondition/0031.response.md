According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has been modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next ASCII character. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still be present in the modified `s`. Since `char` was replaced with the next ASCII character, we need to ensure that the new character (the next ASCII character) is still equal to or can be found in `s`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` is now the next ASCII character, and it must still be in `s`.

State: **`res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `next_char` and `next ASCII character` and `char` is the next ASCII character currently in `s`**
