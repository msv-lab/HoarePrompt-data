Output State: **`if char is in s then res` contains characters found in the order they appeared in `s` plus `char`, and `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet. The loop continues until `char` is no longer in `s`, at which point `s` will have been modified multiple times, and `char` will be the last character processed. If `char` is not in `s` initially, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains unchanged.**
