The code appends `char` to `res`. Given that `char` is the next character in the alphabet and `res` already contains all occurrences of this next character in ASCII order from `s`, the state of `res` will now include one additional occurrence of `char`. The previous values of `res` are not specified, but the action taken will modify `res` by adding `char` to it. Therefore, the output state reflects that `char` has been added to `res`.

Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of the next character in ASCII order that were originally in `s`, plus an additional occurrence of `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet**.
