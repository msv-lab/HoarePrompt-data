According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is still in `s`, which means the loop can execute one more time without needing any adjustments. 

State: **`res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `char` is still in `s`**
