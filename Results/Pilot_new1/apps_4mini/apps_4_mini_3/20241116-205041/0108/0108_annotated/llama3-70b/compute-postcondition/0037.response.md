Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of each character from 'a' to 'z' found in `s`, in the order of their appearance, while `s` will have those characters replaced with the next character in ASCII order for each occurrence. If a character is not found in `s`, the loop for that character does not execute, leaving `res` unchanged and `s` unchanged for that character. If `s` contains no characters from 'a' to 'z', the loop will not execute at all, resulting in `res` remaining an empty string and `s` unchanged.**
