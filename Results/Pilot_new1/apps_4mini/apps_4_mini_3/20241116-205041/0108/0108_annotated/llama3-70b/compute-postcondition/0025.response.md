According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet`. The loop iterates over each character in `alphabet`. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains all occurrences of `char` from `s`, and `s` has been modified to replace `char` with the next character in ASCII. 

Since the loop iterates over `alphabet`, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `alphabet` that has not been processed yet. If `char` was the last character in `alphabet`, the loop would not execute again. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that we are now processing the next character in `alphabet`. Assuming `char` was the last character processed in the previous iteration, the next character in `alphabet` must be the next one in order.

State: **`if char is in s then res` contains all occurrences of the next character in ASCII order that were originally in `s`, `s` has the previous `char` replaced with the next character in ASCII, and `char` is the next character in `alphabet`**
