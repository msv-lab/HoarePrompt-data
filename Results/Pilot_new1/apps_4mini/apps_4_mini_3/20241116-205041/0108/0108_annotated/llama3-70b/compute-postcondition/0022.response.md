The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next character in ASCII. The variable `s` is updated accordingly, and since `char` is still present in `s`, it does not affect the count of `char` in `res`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `char` is still in `s`, and `res` now contains one more `char`.

Output State: **`res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `char` is still in `s`, and `res` now contains one more `char`**
