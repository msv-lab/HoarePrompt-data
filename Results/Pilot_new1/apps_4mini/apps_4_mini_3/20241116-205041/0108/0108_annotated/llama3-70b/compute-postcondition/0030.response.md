The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the Unicode table. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `ord(char) + 1`, and then `chr` converts it back to a character. Since `s` contains at least one occurrence of `char`, the replacement will successfully occur. The value of `res` is not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in Unicode, and `res` is updated to include `char`**
