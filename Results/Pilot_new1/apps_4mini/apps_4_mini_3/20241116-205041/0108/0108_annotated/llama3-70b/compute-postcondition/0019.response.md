The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next character in ASCII. Since `res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`, it is not affected by the replacement in `s`. The state of `s` changes, but `char` remains in `s` because there are additional occurrences. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`, `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII, and `char` is still in `s`.

Output State: **`res` contains an additional occurrence of `char`; `s` is updated with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `char` is still in `s**
