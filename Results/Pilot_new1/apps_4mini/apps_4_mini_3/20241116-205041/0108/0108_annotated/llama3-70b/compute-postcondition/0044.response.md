Functionality: ** The function reads a string of lowercase English letters from input, constructs a new string `res` containing all occurrences of characters from 'a' to 'z' found in the input string in the order of their appearance, while replacing each occurrence with the next character in ASCII order. If `res` contains all 26 letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. If the input string does not contain any characters from 'a' to 'z', `res` will be empty and the function will also print -1. The function does not return any value. **
