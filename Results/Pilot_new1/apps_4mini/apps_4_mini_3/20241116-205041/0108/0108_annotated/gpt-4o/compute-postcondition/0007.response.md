The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after execution, `i` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, `j`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1**
