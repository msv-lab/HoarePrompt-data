The variable `target` is assigned the string value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This assignment does not affect the value of `s`, which remains as an input string consisting of lowercase English letters. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged value of `s` along with the newly assigned value of `target`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
