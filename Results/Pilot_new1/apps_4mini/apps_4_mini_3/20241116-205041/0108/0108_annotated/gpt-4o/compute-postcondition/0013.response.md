The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state reflects that `j` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string and len(s) is greater than 2, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
