The code attempts to print the variable `target`. However, the variable `target` has not been defined or assigned any value in the given context. Therefore, the execution will result in an error due to the undefined variable.

Since the state of `s`, `i`, and `j` does not affect the output because `target` is not defined, the output state reflects the situation.

Output State: **`s` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is equal to 26, and an error occurs due to `target` being undefined.**
