The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is 1. Therefore, after execution, `i` becomes 2. The values of the other variables (`s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j`) remain unchanged. Hence, the output state is: `s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, and `j` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, and `j` remains unchanged**
