Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo i, 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it immediately returns 'No'. Then, it iterates through all integers i from 1 to k and keeps track of the remainders in a set. If it encounters a remainder that is already in the set, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes' indicating that all remainders are distinct. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
