According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k+1, and `remainder` is the result of n % (k+1). For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `k + 1` to include the upper limit. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k+1, `remainder` is the result of n % (k+1), `i` is equal to `k + 1`**
