According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k. Since `k` is included in the loop range, the loop will execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, and `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k**
