Output State: 
- `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- `seen_remainders` includes all remainders from 1 to k.
- If the remainder is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'.
- Otherwise, `remainder` is the result of n % i for each i in the loop range.
- If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the variables.
