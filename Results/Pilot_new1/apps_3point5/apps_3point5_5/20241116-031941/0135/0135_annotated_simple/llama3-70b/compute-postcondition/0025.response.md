Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, then iterates from 1 to `k` checking for repeated remainders when dividing `n` by each number. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value.**
