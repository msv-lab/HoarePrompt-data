According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n`, `k` are values assigned from the input after splitting, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values encountered so far along with the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`**
