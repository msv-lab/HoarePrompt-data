Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers `n` and `k` as input. It then iterates over the range from 1 to `k` and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If the remainder is already in the set `seen`, it means that the remainder is not distinct and the program immediately prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are distinct, the program prints 'Yes' after the loop completes. This logic correctly follows the problem description and ensures that all remainders are distinct. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected.
