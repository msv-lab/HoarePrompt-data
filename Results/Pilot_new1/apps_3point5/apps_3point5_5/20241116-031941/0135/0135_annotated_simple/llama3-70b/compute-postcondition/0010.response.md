Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo `i`, where `n` and `i` are values assigned from the input after splitting, and `i` is 2. The value of `remainder` depends on the value of `n`. The set `seen` is updated with the newly added `remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are values assigned from the input after splitting, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values encountered so far along with the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are values assigned from the input after splitting, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values encountered so far along with the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `i`**
