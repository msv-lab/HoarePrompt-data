Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No', which is in line with the problem description.
- If k is less than n, the function iterates through values from 1 to k inclusive, calculating the remainder of n divided by each value. If any remainder is already seen, it returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, it returns 'Yes'. This logic aligns with the problem description.
- The code also handles the case where k is less than 1, where the loop does not execute, and there is no change in the values of n, k, i, and remainder.
- Overall, the code follows the problem description for all potential cases, and the output hints confirm the correctness of the code.
