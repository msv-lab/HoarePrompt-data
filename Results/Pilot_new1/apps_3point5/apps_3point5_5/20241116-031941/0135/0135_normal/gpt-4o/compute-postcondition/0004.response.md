According to the code, the loop will execute if k is less than n. Before the loop starts, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. To ensure the loop executes, the values need to be adjusted to k is less than n and i is 1.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n, i is 1**
