The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of n and k.

Case_2: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is the number of iterations (up to k), `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i. If `remainder` is in the list of `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the values of n, k, i, and remainder.

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No', 'Yes', or handle the values of n, k, i, and remainder accordingly.
