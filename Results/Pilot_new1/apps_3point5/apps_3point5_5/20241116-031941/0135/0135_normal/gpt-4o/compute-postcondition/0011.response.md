According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 1. Since `i` is already greater than `k`, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 1**
