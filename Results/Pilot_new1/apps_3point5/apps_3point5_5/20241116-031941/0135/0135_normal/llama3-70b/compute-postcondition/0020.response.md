Example Answer:
`remainder` is added to the set `seen`. The previous values of the variables are `n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 3. After executing the code, `remainder` is added to `seen`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the updated set of values including `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 3.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the updated set of values including `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 3**
