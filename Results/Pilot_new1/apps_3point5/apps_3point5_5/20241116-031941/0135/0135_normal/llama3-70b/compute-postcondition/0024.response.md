The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the result of a mathematical operation involving the integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The specific mathematical operation to be performed by the function is not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform a mathematical operation involving the integers `n` and `k`, with the constraints that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and return the result of this operation.
