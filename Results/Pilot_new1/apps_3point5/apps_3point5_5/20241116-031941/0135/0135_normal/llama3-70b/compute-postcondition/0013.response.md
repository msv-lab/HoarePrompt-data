Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. If the value of `remainder` is already in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `seen` after the execution of the if statement.***
