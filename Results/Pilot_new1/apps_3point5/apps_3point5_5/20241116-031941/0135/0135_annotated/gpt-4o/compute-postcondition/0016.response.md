The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables n and k.

Case 2: If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is already in seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop adds the remainder to seen_remainders.

Case 3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
