Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is an integer and `i` is 2. Since `n` can be any integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, the value of `remainder` can be 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer where n ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer where n ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
