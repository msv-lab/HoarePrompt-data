According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer where `n ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer where n ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
