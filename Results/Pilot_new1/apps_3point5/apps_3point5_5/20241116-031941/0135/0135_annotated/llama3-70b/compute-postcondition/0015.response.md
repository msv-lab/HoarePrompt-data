According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to the previous value of `k` + 1, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after `k`, which is `k + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `k`, `i` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`**
