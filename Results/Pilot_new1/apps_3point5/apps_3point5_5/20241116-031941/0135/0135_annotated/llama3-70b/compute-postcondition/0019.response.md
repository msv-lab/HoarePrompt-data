Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `i`, `remainder`, `seen` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `remainder` is the calculated remainder of `n` divided by `i`; `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`. If the `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits without making any modifications to the variables.***
