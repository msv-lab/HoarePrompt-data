Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of division of n by integers from 1 to k are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. If at any point a remainder is encountered that has already been seen, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program handles all potential cases and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
