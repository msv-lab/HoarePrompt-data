Output State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable that is True if there exists an element `x` in the list `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. The variable `m` is increased by 1 for each iteration of the loop. The list `assigned` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is met during any iteration, `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop is terminated. If the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False, `m` is increased by 1 for each iteration, and `assigned` still contains at least one element.**
