According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the assigned list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `can_form` is False does not impact the loop execution, so it remains the same. `m` being increased by 1 does not affect the loop execution either. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: assigned list contains at least one element, and x is the first element in the assigned list.
State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, assigned list contains at least one element, x is the first element in the assigned list**
