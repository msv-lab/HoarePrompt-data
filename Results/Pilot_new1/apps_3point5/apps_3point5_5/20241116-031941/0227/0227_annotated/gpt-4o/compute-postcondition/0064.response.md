Example Answer: 
The value of `m` is increased by 1, and the previous value of `m` is unknown. The value of `can_form` remains False, and `x` is not updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `x` is not updated.
Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `x` is not updated**
