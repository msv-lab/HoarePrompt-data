Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `m` and `assigned` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least two elements.
Output State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains at least two elements**
