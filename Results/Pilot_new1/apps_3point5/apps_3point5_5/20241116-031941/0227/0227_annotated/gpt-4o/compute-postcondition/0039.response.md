Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If the condition a[i] - x is in the list assigned, then `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and the loop is broken. The list assigned must contain at least two elements for this condition to be met. No changes occur if the condition is not satisfied.***
