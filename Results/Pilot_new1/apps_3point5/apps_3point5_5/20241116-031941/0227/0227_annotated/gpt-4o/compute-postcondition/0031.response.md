Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable that is True if the element at index `i` of list `a` is equal to `x` plus an element in the list `assigned`. The variable `m` is increased by 1. The list `assigned` contains at least one element. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is satisfied, `can_form` is set to True, `m` is increased by 1, and we break out of the loop.***
