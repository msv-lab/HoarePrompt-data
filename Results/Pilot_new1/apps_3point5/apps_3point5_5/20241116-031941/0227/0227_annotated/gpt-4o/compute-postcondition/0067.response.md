According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is a boolean, `m` has been modified based on the condition, `x` may or may not have been updated based on the condition, and `assigned` may or may not have been modified. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean, `m` has been updated, `x` may or may not have been updated, `assigned` may or may not have been modified, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
