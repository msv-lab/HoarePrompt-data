Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least three elements, `m` is 1, `i` is 2. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
