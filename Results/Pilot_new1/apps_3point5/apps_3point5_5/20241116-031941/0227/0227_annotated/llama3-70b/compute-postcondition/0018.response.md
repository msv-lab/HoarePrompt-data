Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each element is double the previous element. If an element is not double the previous one, it increments `m`. After the loop, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function assumes `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23 and the list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9.**
