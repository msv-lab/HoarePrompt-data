Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, sorts the list of integers, and iterates through the list to check if each element is double the previous element. If an element is not double the previous one, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the annotations provide a clear summary of the code's functionality.
