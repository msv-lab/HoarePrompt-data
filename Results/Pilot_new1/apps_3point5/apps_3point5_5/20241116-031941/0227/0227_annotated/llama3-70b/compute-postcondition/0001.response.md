Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element after splitting the input by spaces. The input is taken, split, converted to integers, and stored in the list `a`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers**
