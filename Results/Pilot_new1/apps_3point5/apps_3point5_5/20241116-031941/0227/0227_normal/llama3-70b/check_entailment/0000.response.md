Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a list of integers `a`, sorts the list, and iterates through the list checking if each element is twice the value of the previous element. 
- If the element is not twice the value of the previous element, it increments the count `m`.
- Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.
- The code seems to follow the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations.
