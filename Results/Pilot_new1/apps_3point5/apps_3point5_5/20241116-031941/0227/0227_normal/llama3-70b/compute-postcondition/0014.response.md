According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the element at index 1 in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index 0, and `m` is an integer. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` should be less than `n+1`, so `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the element at index 1 in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is less than `n+1`**
