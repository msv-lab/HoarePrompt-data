The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function processes all elements in the list `a` and returns the final value of 'm' after processing all elements in list 'a'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of distinct positive integers, process all elements in the list, and return the final value of 'm'.
