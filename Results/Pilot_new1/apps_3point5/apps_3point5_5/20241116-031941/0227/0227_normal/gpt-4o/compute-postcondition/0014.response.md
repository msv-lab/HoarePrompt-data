Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the second smallest positive integer from list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If there exists an element `a[i] - x` in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
