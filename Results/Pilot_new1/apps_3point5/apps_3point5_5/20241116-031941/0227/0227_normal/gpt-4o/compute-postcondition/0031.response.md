Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a` with at least one element, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is the first element in `assigned`. If there exists an index `i` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False after the loop completes.***
