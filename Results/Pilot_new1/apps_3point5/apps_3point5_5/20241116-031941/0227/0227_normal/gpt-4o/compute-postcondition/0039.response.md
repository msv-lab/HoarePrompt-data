Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is the second element in `assigned`, if there exists an element `a[i]` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
