Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, `assigned` does not contain the current element `x` and contains at least one more element, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is less than `n-1`, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and the next `x` is present in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
