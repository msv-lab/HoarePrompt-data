Example Answer: 
The value at index 0 of list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, the value at index 0 is the smallest positive integer in the list. Therefore, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a`**
