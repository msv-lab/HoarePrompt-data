Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It does this by sorting the input sequence `a`, then iterating through it to check if each element is equal to the previous element multiplied by 2. If not, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.

The logic of the program is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program will output the correct result for all possible inputs within the given constraints.
