Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The elements in the list `a` are distinct positive integers, and the range of each element is between 1 and 10^9. Sorting the list does not change the values of the elements but rearranges them in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order where each element is within the range 1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order where each element is within the range 1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9.**
