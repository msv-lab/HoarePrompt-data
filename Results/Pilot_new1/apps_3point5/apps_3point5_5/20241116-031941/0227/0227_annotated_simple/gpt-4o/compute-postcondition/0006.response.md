According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the set `assigned` is not empty. Since the set `assigned` has at least one element (the smallest positive integer from list `a`), the loop will execute. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False, and `x` is the smallest positive integer from list `a`.
State: **The smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the smallest positive integer from list `a`**
