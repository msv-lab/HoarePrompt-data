Postcondition: ***The smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the smallest positive integer from list `a`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the set `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
