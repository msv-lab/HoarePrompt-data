According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in `assigned` and `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty or `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the loop will not execute. After the execution of the if statement, if `can_form` was initially False, `m` is incremented by 1. `assigned` is updated with the value `a[i]`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the smallest positive integer from list `a` is in `assigned`, so `can_form` is True. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `assigned` and `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
1. Check if there are still elements in `assigned`.
2. Check if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
State: **If there are still elements in `assigned` and `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then the loop will execute again.**
