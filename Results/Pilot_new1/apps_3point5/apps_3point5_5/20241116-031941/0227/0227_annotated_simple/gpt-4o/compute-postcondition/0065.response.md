Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` with a difference equal to `a[i]`. If `can_form` is False and `assigned` is not empty, `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True or `assigned` is empty, `m` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is not added to `assigned`, and `i` remains the same.***
