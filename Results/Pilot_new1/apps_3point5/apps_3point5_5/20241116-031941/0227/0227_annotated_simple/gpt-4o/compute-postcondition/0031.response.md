Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If the element at index `i` of list `a` subtracted by `x` is present in the non-empty list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. The list `assigned` is not empty after the execution of the if statement.***
