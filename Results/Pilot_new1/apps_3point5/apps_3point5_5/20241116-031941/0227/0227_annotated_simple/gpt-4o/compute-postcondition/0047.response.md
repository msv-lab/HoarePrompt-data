Example Answer:
`can_form` is assigned the value False. If `can_form` was initially False, `m` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown. `a[i]` is added to `assigned`, but the values of `a` and `i` are unknown. `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is also unknown.
Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1 if it was initially False, `a[i]` is added to `assigned`, `i` is incremented by 1**
