Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True. In this case, `m` is increased by 1 if it was initially False, `a[i]` is added to `assigned`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `assigned` still has at least 1 element with `x` being the first element. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False without any other changes to the variables.***
