Output State: **If the smallest positive integer from list `a` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `assigned` and `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`. If `assigned` is empty or `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, the loop will not execute. After the execution of the if statement, if `can_form` was initially False, `m` is incremented by 1. `assigned` is updated with the value `a[i]`.**
