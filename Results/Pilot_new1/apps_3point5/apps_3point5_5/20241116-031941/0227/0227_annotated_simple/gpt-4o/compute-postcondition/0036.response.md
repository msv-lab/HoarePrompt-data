According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `assigned` and the boolean variable `can_form`. If `can_form` is False, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is False. So for the loop to execute one more time, `can_form` needs to remain False. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`can_form` is False**
