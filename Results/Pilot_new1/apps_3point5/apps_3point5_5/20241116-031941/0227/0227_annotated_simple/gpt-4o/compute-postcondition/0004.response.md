According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, the smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, and `m` is 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 1, `i` is now 1, and the smallest positive integer from list `a` is still in the set `assigned`.
State: **The smallest positive integer from list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
