Example Answer:
The value of `a[i]` is added to the set `assigned`. The state of other variables remains the same based on the conditions provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is a boolean indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` with a difference equal to `a[i]`. If `can_form` is False and `assigned` is not empty, `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True or `assigned` is empty, `m` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is not added to `assigned`, and `i` remains the same, and `a[i]` is added to `assigned`.
Output State: **`can_form` is a boolean indicating whether there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` with a difference equal to `a[i]`. If `can_form` is False and `assigned` is not empty, `m` is increased by 1. If `can_form` is True or `assigned` is empty, `m` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is not added to `assigned`, and `i` remains the same, and `a[i]` is added to `assigned`**
