According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the assigned list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `can_form` is False does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `assigned` is not empty. 
State: **`can_form` is False, `assigned` is not empty**
