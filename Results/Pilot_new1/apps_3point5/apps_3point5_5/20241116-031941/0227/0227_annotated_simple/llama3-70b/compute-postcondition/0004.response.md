According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23 ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, so the states need to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 1**
