According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 4**
