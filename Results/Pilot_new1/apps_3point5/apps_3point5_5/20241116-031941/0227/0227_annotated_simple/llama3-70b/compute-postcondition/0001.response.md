Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of the list `a` are distinct positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**
