Example Answer:
If floor_a is equal to 1, then time_to_exit is 0. If floor_a is not equal to 1, then time_to_exit is calculated as 10 + (floor_a - 1). direct_walk_time is calculated as abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15. After executing the given code snippet, reverse_walk_time is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. The values of floor_a, block_a, block_b, and n are not provided, so the output state will depend on those values.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of floor_a, block_a, block_b, and n**
