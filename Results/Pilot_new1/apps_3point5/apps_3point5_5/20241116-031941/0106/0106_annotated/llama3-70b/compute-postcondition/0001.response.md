Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `a` and `b` are now integers obtained from the input. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input**
