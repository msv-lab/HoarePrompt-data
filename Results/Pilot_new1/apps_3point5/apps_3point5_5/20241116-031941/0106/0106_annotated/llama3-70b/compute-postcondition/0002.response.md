Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `a` and `m` are provided as input integers. The calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1` will result in a new value for `a_floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a_floor` is a new calculated value based on the input values of `a` and `m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, `a_floor` is a new calculated value based on the input values of `a` and `m`**
