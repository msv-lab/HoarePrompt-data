Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts five positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the time required to move from location `a` to location `b` within a building based on the block and floor locations. The function determines the time to exit the building, the minimum walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. It then returns the total time as the sum of these calculated times. The functionality does not consider edge cases where the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` do not fall within the specified ranges or if there are inconsistencies in the location data provided.**
