Example Answer:
`time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`. Since the formula is (floor_b - 1) * 5, the value of `time_to_target_floor` will be 5 times the value of `floor_b` minus 5. No other variables are affected by this calculation.
Output State: **`time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`**
