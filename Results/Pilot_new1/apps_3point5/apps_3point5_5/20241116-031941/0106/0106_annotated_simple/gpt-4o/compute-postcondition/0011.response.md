Example Answer:
`total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The value of `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`. The states of `time_to_exit` and `min_walk_time` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`; `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.
Output State: **`time_to_target_floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_b`; `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor**.
