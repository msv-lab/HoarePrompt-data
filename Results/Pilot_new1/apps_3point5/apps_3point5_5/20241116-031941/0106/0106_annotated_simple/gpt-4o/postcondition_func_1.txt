The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment` and calculates the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the given formulas. The formula assigns `block` based on the division of the apartment number by `(m * k) + 1`, and `floor` based on the modulo operation and division by `k`. The function then returns the calculated values of 'block' and 'floor'. The function does not handle edge cases where `m`, `k`, or `apartment` might be zero or negative, which could lead to unexpected results.
