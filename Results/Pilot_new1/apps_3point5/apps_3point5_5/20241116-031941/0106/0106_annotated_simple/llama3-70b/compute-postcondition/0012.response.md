Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, and `b_floor` is calculated as described; `b_block` is calculated as ((b - 1) // (m * k)) + 1; `min_block_time` is an integer calculated value. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. The code then prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
