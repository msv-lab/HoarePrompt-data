The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates the floor and block numbers for `a` and `b`, determines the minimum time to move between blocks and floors based on specific conditions, and prints the total time required for the movement. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
