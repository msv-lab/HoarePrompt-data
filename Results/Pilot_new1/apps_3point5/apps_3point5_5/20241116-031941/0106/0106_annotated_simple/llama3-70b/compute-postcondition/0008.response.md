Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, and `b_floor` is calculated as described; `b_block` is calculated as ((b - 1) // (m * k)) + 1; `min_block_time` is an integer calculated value. The value of `a_floor` is greater than the value of `b_floor`; `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
