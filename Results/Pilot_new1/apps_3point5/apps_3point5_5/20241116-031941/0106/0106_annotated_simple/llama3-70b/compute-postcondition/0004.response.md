Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `b` and `m` are known, so `b_floor` is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, and `b_floor` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from input splitting; `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from input splitting; `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula, and `b_floor` is calculated as described**
