The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any value, but it performs the following actions:

1. Generates a random integer `num` between 1 and `n*m*k`.
2. If `num` is equal to `a`, the function prints "Success! a is found".
3. If `num` is equal to `b`, the function prints "Success! b is found".
4. If `num` is not equal to either `a` or `b`, the function prints "Neither a nor b is found". 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to generate a random integer within the specified range and print messages based on whether the generated number matches `a`, `b`, or neither.
