Output State: **`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b` are set based on the location of `a` and `b`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15.**
