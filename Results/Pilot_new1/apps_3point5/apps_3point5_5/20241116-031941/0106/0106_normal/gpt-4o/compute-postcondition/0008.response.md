Example Answer:
`reverse_walk_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. The value of `n` is not given, so it remains unknown. The output state is dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b`. No other variables are affected by this calculation.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `block_a` and `block_b`, `reverse_walk_time` is calculated using the formula provided.**
