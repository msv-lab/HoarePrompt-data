Example Answer:
The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `apartment` is unknown, but based on the formula, `block` is calculated based on the values of `m` and `k`. The output state is: **Precondition**: **m, n, k are integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000. a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k and a != b.** `block` is calculated based on the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
