Example Answer:
The variable `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `apartment` is used in the calculation after subtracting 1. The result is then taken modulo of the product of `m` and `k`. Without knowing the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition.
Output State: **Precondition**
