Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values, `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values, `b_block` is calculated based on the input values, `min_block_time` is the minimum of either the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, or `n` minus the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, multiplied by 15**
