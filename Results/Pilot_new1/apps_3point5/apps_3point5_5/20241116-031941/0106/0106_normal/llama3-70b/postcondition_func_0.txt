The function reads input values for n, m, k, a, and b. It then calculates the floor and block numbers for a and b based on the input values. The function computes the minimum block time and minimum floor time based on the calculated values and prints their sum. The function does not accept any parameters and focuses on calculating and printing the total time for block and floor movements.
