Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000. `a` and `b` are input integers. `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values, `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values, `b_block` is calculated based on the input values, `min_block_time` is the minimum of either the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, or `n` minus the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, multiplied by 15. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Otherwise, if `(a_floor <= b_floor)`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. The code then prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.**
