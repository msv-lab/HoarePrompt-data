Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by space and converting them to integers. The values of `a` and `b` are based on the user input, so they can vary. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers**
