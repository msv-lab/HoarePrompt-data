Example Answer:
`b_block` is assigned the value of `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `b`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. The value of `b_block` is calculated based on the input values of `b`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values, `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values, `b_block` is calculated based on the input values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the remainder of `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the input values, `b_floor` is calculated based on the input values, `b_block` is calculated based on the input values**
