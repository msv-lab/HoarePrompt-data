Postcondition: ***If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue remain empty. If votes contains at least one 'D' or 'R' character, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in votes, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in votes. If d_queue and r_queue are not both non-empty, the loop will not execute. Upon execution of the if-else block, if d_queue is non-empty, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed. The variables d_queue and r_queue remain unchanged after this block of code.***
