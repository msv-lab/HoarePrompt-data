According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `d_queue` is either [2, 3, 2] or [2, 3], and `r_queue` is [5]. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to remain non-empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`d_queue` is [2, 3, 2] or [2, 3], `r_queue` is [5]**
