The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and a string `votes` of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. It then processes the votes by creating queues for 'D' and 'R' indices. It iterates through both queues, adjusting the indices based on a comparison, and prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is non-empty, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
