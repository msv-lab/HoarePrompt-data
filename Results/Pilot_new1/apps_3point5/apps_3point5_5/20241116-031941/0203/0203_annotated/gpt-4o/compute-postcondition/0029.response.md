Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`, which is 4. The previous values of `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `d_index`, and `votes` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is [2, 3], `r_queue` is [5], `d_index` is 1, `r_index` is 4, and `votes` is 'DXXRR'.
Output State: **`d_queue` is [2, 3], `r_queue` is [5], `d_index` is 1, `r_index` is 4, and `votes` is 'DXXRR'**
