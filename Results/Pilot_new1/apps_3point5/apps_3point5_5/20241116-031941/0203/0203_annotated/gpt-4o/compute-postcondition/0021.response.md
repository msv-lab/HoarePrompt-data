Output State: **If votes is an empty string, both d_queue and r_queue remain empty. If votes contains at least one 'D' or 'R' character, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in votes, and d_index is assigned the value popped from d_queue. r_index is assigned the value popped from r_queue.**
