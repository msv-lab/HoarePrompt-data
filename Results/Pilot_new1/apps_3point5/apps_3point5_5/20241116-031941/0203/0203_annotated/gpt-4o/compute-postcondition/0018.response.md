According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `votes` string. If there are more characters in the string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, and `votes` is a string of length n+1. To execute the loop one more time, the length of the `votes` string needs to be greater than n+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n+2 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If v == 'D', d_queue contains the appended value of i, and r_queue remains unchanged. If v == 'R', r_queue contains the appended value of i, and d_queue is unchanged.**
