The value of `r_index` is added to `n`, but `n` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is [2, 3], `r_queue` is [5], `d_index` is 1, `r_index` is 4, `votes` is 'DXXRR'.
Output State: **`d_queue` is [2, 3], `r_queue` is [5], `d_index` is 1, `r_index` is 4, and `votes` is 'DXXRR'**
