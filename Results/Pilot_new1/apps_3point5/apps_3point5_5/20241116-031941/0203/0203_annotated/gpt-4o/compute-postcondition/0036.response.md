Example Answer:
`d_queue` is appended with the value of `d_index + n`, where `d_index` is 2 and `n` is not defined. Therefore, the value appended to `d_queue` is 2 + n. The initial state of `d_queue` is [3, 2] or [3], so after appending, the output state is: d_queue is [3, 2, 2 + n] or [3, 2 + n]; r_queue is empty, d_index is 2, r_index is 5.
Output State: **d_queue is [3, 2, 2 + n] or [3, 2 + n]; r_queue is empty, d_index is 2, r_index is 5**
