Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value of the first element popped from `d_queue`, which is 2. The `d_queue` is modified to be [3, 2] or [3] based on the initial state. The `r_queue` remains unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d_queue` is [3, 2] or [3], `r_queue` is [5], `d_index` is 2.
Output State: **`d_queue` is [3, 2] or [3], `r_queue` is [5], `d_index` is 2**
