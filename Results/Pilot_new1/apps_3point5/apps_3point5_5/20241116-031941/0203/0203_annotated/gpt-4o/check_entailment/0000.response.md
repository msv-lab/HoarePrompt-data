Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It creates separate queues for 'D' and 'R' indices, processes the votes according to the rules of the voting procedure, and determines the outcome of the vote based on the final state of the queues. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the code processes the votes and determines the winner. 

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. All the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. Therefore, the code can be considered correct.
