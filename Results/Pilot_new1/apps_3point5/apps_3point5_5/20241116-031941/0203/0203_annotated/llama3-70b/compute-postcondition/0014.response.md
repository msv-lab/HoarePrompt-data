According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, fractions list has at least 2 elements, and fraction is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements, and fraction is the third element in the list.
State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees. If fraction is 'D', depublicans is incremented by 1; if fraction is 'R', remocrats is incremented by 1. In all cases, only one of depublicans or remocrats is increased by 1 based on the value of fraction. The fractions list has at least 3 elements, and fraction is the third element in the list.**
