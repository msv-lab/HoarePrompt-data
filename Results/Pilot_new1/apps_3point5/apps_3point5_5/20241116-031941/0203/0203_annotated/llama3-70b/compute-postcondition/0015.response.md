Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, but based on the code, it is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer representing the number of employees. If fraction is 'D', depublicans is incremented by 1; if fraction is 'R', remocrats is incremented by 1. In all cases, only one of depublicans or remocrats is increased by 1 based on the value of fraction. The fractions list has at least 3 elements, and fraction is the third element in the list. After execution, depublicans is increased by 1.
