Example Answer: 
The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, but since the code snippet specifies that only one of `depublicans` or `remocrats` is increased by 1, we can infer that `remocrats` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: depublicans is increased by 1, remocrats remains the same.
Output State: **depublicans is increased by 1, remocrats remains the same**
