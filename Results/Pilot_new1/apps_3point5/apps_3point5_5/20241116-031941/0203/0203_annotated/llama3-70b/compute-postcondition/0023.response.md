Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees. If fraction is 'D', depublicans is incremented by 1; if fraction is 'R', remocrats is incremented by 1. In all cases, only one of depublicans or remocrats is increased by 1 based on the value of fraction. After the loop executes, depublicans will represent the total number of 'D' fractions in the list, and remocrats will represent the total number of 'R' fractions in the list. If depublicans is not greater than remocrats, the program will enter the else block.**
