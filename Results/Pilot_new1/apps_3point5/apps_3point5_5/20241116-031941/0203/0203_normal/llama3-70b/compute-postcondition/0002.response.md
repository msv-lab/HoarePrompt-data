`depublicans` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `n` and `fractions` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a string input, `depublicans` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a string input, `depublicans` is 0**
