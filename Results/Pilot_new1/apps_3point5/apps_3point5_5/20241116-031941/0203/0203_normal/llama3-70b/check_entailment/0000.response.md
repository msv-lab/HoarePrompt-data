Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes the input of the number of employees and their respective fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) fractions. Finally, it prints 'D' if the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of 'R' fractions, and 'R' otherwise. This logic aligns with the problem description, where the outcome of the vote is determined by the fraction with more members left at the end of the voting process. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the required functionality.
