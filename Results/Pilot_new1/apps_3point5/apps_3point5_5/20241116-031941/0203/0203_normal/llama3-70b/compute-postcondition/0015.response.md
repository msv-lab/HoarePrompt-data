Example Answer:
The value of `depublicans` is increased by 1. The states of `remocrats` and `fractions` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input with at least one character, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input with at least one character, `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains the same**
