According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If there are more characters left in the string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input with at least one character. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the last `fraction` processed was 'D', then `depublicans` should remain increased by 1 and `remocrats` should be reset to 0.
- If the last `fraction` processed was not 'D', then `remocrats` should remain increased by 1 and `depublicans` should be reset to 0.
- The `fractions` string should still have more characters left for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string input with at least one character, either `depublicans` is increased by 1 or `remocrats` is increased by 1 based on the last `fraction` processed, and there are more characters left in the `fractions` string**
