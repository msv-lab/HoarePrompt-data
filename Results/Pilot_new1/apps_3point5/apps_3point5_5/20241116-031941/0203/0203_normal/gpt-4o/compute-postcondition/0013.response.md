Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`. If the character in `votes` is 'D', then the index `i` is appended to `d_queue`. If the character is not 'D', the index `i` is appended to `r_queue`.***
