Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. Since the initial state of `r_queue` is not provided, we can only state that `i` is appended to `r_queue`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+2, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`, and `i` is appended to `r_queue`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+2, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`, and `i` is appended to `r_queue`**
