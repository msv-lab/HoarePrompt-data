Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to the `d_queue` list. The previous state of `d_queue` is unknown, and `i` is also unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+2, `d_queue` has an additional element `i`, and `r_queue` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+2, `d_queue` has an additional element `i`, `r_queue` remains unchanged**
