Example Answer:
r_queue appends the value of r_index + n. Since the condition (d_index < r_index) is false, the value of r_index is not updated. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n, d_queue and r_queue are lists, d_index is the first index from d_queue, r_index is updated based on the popped value from r_queue, and the condition (d_index < r_index) is false.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n, d_queue and r_queue are lists, d_index is the first index from d_queue, r_index is updated based on the popped value from r_queue, and the condition (d_index < r_index) is false**
