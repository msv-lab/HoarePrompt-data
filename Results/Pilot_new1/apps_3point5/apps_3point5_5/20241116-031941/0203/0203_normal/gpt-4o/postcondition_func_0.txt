The function reads an integer `n` and a string of length `n` representing votes. It then processes the votes to determine the majority party among Democrats ('D') and Republicans ('R'). The function prints 'D' if the Democratic party has the majority, and 'R' if the Republican party has the majority. If there is a tie in the number of votes for both parties, it does not handle this case as indicated by the missing 'Tie' condition in the return postconditions. The function does not return any value but prints the majority party.
