According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in the `votes` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. The next iteration will depend on whether there are more elements in the `votes` string to iterate over.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If there are more elements in the `votes` string, then `i` should be updated to the next index value.
- If the next character in `votes` is 'D', then the index `i` should be appended to `d_queue`.
- If the next character in `votes` is not 'D', then the index `i` should be appended to `r_queue`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n+1, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists with updated values based on the next character in `votes`.**
