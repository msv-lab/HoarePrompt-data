Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. If the first character in `votes` is 'D', then the index `i` is appended to `d_queue`. If the first character in `votes` is not 'D', then the index `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The state of the program variables after the if-else block execution covers all edge cases and possible scenarios.***
