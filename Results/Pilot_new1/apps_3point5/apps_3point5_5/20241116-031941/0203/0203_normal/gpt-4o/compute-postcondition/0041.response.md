Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. After the loop executes, `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be updated based on the values of `d_index` and `r_index`. The loop will continue executing as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. If `votes` is an empty string, the loop will not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty. The loop will execute as long as `d_queue` is not empty. Ensure that the logic handles all possible edge cases related to the indices and queues.***
