Example Answer: 
The value at index 0 is removed from `r_queue` and assigned to `r_index`. The previous values of `r_queue`, `d_queue`, `r_index`, and `d_index` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended, r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index.
Output State: **d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended, r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index**
