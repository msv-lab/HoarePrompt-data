Postcondition: ***If both d_queue and r_queue are initially empty or either d_queue or r_queue is empty before the loop starts, the loop will not execute. If d_queue contains indices of 'D' characters and r_queue is empty, d_queue will remain unchanged, and r_queue will be empty. If r_queue contains indices of 'R' characters and d_queue is empty, r_queue will remain unchanged, and d_queue will be empty. If both d_queue and r_queue contain indices of 'D' and 'R' characters respectively, the loop will continue to execute until one of the queues becomes empty. After the loop finishes executing, d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters, and r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters. The values of d_index and r_index will depend on the last comparison made between the popped indices. 'D' is printed if d_queue is not empty, otherwise 'R' is printed.***
