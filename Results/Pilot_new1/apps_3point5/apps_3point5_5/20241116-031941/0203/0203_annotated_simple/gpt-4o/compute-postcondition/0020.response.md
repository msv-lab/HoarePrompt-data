Example Answer:
The code pops the first index from the `d_queue` which contains the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string. If `d_queue` was not empty, the value of `d_index` will be the index of the first 'D' character. If `d_queue` was empty, an error would occur. The state of `r_queue` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string.
Output State: **d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string**
