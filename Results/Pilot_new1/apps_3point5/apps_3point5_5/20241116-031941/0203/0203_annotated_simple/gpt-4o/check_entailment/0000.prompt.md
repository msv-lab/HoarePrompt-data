You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n employees in Alternative Cake Manufacturing (ACM). They are now voting on some very important question and the leading world media are trying to predict the outcome of the vote.

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction. 

You know the order employees are going to vote and that they behave optimal (and they also know the order and who belongs to which fraction). Predict the outcome of the vote.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of employees. 

The next line contains n characters. The i-th character is 'D' if the i-th employee is from depublicans fraction or 'R' if he is from remocrats.


-----Output-----

Print 'D' if the outcome of the vote will be suitable for depublicans and 'R' if remocrats will win.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
DDRRR

Output
D

Input
6
DDRRRR

Output
R



-----Note-----

Consider one of the voting scenarios for the first sample:   Employee 1 denies employee 5 to vote.  Employee 2 denies employee 3 to vote.  Employee 3 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 2).  Employee 4 denies employee 2 to vote.  Employee 5 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 1).  Employee 1 denies employee 4.  Only employee 1 now has the right to vote so the voting ends with the victory of depublicans.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    votes = input().strip()
    d_queue = []
    r_queue = []
    for (i, v) in enumerate(votes):
        if v == 'D':
            d_queue.append(i)
        else:
            r_queue.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters in the votes string, d_queue will remain empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the votes string, r_queue will remain empty.
    while d_queue and r_queue:
        d_index = d_queue.pop(0)
        
        r_index = r_queue.pop(0)
        
        if d_index < r_index:
            d_queue.append(d_index + n)
        else:
            r_queue.append(r_index + n)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #If both d_queue and r_queue are initially empty, the loop will not execute.
    #If either d_queue or r_queue is empty before the loop starts, the loop will not execute.
    #If d_queue contains indices of 'D' characters and r_queue is empty, d_queue will remain unchanged, and r_queue will be empty.
    #If r_queue contains indices of 'R' characters and d_queue is empty, r_queue will remain unchanged, and d_queue will be empty.
    #If both d_queue and r_queue contain indices of 'D' and 'R' characters respectively, the loop will continue to execute until one of the queues becomes empty.
    #After the loop finishes executing, d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters, and r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters. The values of d_index and r_index will depend on the last comparison made between the popped indices.
    if d_queue :
        print('D')
    else :
        print('R')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If both d_queue and r_queue are initially empty or either d_queue or r_queue is empty before the loop starts, the loop will not execute. If d_queue contains indices of 'D' characters and r_queue is empty, d_queue will remain unchanged, and r_queue will be empty. If r_queue contains indices of 'R' characters and d_queue is empty, r_queue will remain unchanged, and d_queue will be empty. If both d_queue and r_queue contain indices of 'D' and 'R' characters respectively, the loop will continue to execute until one of the queues becomes empty. After the loop finishes executing, d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters, and r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters. The values of d_index and r_index will depend on the last comparison made between the popped indices. 'D' is printed if d_queue is not empty, otherwise 'R' is printed.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
