Example Answer:
The value of `r_index` is incremented by `n` and appended to the `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_queue` and `r_index` are known, but the value of `n` is not specified. Therefore, the output state is: *d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string with the new appended index, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index.
Output State: **d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string with the new appended index, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index**
