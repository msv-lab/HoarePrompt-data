Output State: **d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping) along with the new value of `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Otherwise, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string with the new appended index, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index.**
