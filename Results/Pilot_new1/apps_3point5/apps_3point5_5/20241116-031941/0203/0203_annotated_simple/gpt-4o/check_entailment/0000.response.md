Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input which consists of the number of employees and the characters representing their fractions.
2. It then categorizes the employees into two queues based on their fractions.
3. The program then simulates the voting process by popping the indices of employees from both queues and determining if they can continue to vote based on their index values.
4. The program correctly handles the scenario where an employee can no longer vote and skips their turn.
5. Finally, the program determines the outcome of the vote based on which queue still has elements remaining.
6. The program follows the problem description accurately and produces the correct output for the given inputs.
