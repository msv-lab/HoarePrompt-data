Example Answer:
The value of `i` is 2, and `r_queue` is a list that contains 1. After executing the code, the value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`, so the `r_queue` will now contain [1, 2]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is adjusted based on the next character in votes, r_queue contains [1, 2], i is 2.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a non-empty string of length n+1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is adjusted based on the next character in votes, r_queue contains [1, 2], i is 2**
