According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping) along with the new value of `d_index + n` if `d_index` is less than `r_index`. Otherwise, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string (updated after popping), `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string with the new appended index, `r_index` is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and `d_index` is either greater than or equal to `r_index`.

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` should have the new value of `d_index + n` appended.
2. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` should have the new appended value of `r_index + n`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **d_queue will contain the updated indices of 'D' characters with the new value of `d_index + n` appended, r_queue will contain the updated indices of 'R' characters with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, r_index is the index of 'R' character that was removed, and d_index is either greater than or equal to r_index**
