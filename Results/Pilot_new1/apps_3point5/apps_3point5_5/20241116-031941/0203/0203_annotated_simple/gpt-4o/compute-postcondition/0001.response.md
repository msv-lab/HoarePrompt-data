Example Answer:
The variable `votes` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The length of the string `votes` is `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters**
