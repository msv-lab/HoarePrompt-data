Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) fractions and determines the outcome of the vote based on which fraction has more members. The program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input examples. The logic of counting the fractions and comparing them to decide the outcome is implemented correctly. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
