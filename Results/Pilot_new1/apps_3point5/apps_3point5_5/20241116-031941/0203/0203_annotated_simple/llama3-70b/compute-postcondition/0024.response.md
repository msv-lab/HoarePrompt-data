Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, input characters are either 'D' or 'R', `depublicans` is the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' fractions. If the list `fractions` is empty, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, if `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`, 'R' is printed.***
