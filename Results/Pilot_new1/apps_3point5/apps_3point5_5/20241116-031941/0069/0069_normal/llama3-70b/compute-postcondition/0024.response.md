Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer + 1, `n` and `x` have assigned values from the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `balance` is the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`, `s` is assigned the input string, and `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s`. If balance is equal to `x`, then print `n + 1`. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, print -1. Otherwise, print ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1).***
