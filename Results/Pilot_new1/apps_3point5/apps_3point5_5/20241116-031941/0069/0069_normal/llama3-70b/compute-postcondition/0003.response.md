Example Answer:
The input function accepts a string input and assigns it to variable `s`. The variables `T`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input**
