Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of test cases `T`, then iterates `T` times to read the length of the string `n`, the desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`.
- It calculates the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s` and determines the balance between '0' and '1' counts.
- If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1` which represents the number of prefixes of `t` with a balance equal to `x`.
- If the difference between `x` and the balance divided by the difference in counts is divisible, it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes.
- Otherwise, it calculates the division result plus 1 and prints it.
- The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case.
