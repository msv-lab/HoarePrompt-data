According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `results` list. If the list has more results, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list of at least 2 results and one of the results is printed. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 results and the next result after the printed result should be selected.
State: **`results` is a list of at least 3 results and the next result after the printed result is selected**
