Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The index is incremented by 3, and the `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`. Other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **The list `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
