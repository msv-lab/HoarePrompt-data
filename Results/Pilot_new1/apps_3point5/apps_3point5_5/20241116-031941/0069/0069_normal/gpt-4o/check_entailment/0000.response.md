Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input for the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of a binary string `n`, a desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`.
- It then calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in `s` and stores the results in `prefix_balances`.
- Based on the conditions provided in the problem description, it appends either -1 or 0 to the `results` list for each test case.
- The code correctly handles the cases where there might be an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance by checking if `x` is in `prefix_balances`.
- The output of the program aligns with the problem description and the provided examples.
