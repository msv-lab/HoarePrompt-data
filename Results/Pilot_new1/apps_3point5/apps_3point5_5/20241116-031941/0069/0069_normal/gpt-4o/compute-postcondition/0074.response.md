Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of non-zero elements with a length greater than or equal to 3, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` incremented by 4, and the balance is not equal to 0. The condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, resulting in `count` being increased by 1. All possible edge cases related to the balance, `x`, and `b` variables are considered, ensuring the correctness of the program's execution.***
