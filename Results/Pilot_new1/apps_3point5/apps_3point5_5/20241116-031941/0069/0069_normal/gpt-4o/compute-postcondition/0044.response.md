Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned the integer value at index + 1 in the data. The value of `index` is not provided, so the exact value of `x` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 1.
Output State: **The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 1**
