Example Answer:
The variable `balance` is assigned the result of counting the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s` and taking the difference. The previous values of variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`, `T` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2] and `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`, `T` is greater than 0, `s` is assigned the value from `data[index + 2] and `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`**
