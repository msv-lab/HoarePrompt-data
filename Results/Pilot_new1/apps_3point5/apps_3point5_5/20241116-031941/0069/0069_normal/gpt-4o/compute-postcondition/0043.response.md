Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list of values and `index` is the index of the value to be converted to an integer. The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. Since `n` is greater than 1, the output state is: The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 1.
Output State: **The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 1**
