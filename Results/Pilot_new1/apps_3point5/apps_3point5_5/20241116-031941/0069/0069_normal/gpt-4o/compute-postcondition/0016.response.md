According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer parsed from the first element of `data`, `x` is an integer assigned the value parsed from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `data` is a list containing the input values in string format, `T` is assigned the integer value parsed from the first element of `data`, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to that index in `s`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
