According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n + 1`, and `n` remains the same. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The list `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is less than n + 2, and `n` remains the same**
