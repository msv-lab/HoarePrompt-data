According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the `results` list must have at least 1 result for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `results` is a list of at least 1 result. 
State: **`results` is a list of at least 1 result**
