Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 0 and T is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update the prefix_balances list based on the condition provided in the loop code. The loop will update the prefix_balances list for each index i from 1 to n. If n is 0 or T is 0, the loop will not execute and the prefix_balances list will remain filled with zeros. Additionally, when balance equals 0, the prefix_balances list will be updated according to the condition specified in the loop code.***
