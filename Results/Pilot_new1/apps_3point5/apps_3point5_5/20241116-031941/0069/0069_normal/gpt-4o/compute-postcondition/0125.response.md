Output State: **If n is greater than 0, the loop will execute and the results list will contain either -1 or 0 based on the conditions stated. If n is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute. In the case where balance is 0, the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's is 0. If x is in prefix_balances, then -1 is appended to results. If x is not in prefix_balances, then 0 is appended to results.**
