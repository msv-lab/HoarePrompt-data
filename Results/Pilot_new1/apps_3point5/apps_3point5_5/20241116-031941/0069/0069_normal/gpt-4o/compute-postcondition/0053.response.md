According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **The list `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is less than n + 1, and `n` remains the same**
