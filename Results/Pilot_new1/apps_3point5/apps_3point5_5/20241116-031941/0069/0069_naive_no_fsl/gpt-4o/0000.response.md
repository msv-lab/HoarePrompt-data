Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. 

The issue lies in the logic used to determine the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x. The program checks if x is in the list of prefix balances, which is incorrect. Instead, it should be checking if there exists a prefix with a balance of x, which can be done by checking if the remainder of (x - b) divided by the balance is 0 and if the quotient is greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
