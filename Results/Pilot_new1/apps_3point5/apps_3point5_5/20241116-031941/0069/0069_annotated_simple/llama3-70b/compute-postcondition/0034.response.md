Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is updated to n + 2, `x` is modified based on the input, `s` is assigned the input value, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are updated based on the count of '0' and '1' characters in `s`, `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. This covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the program.***
