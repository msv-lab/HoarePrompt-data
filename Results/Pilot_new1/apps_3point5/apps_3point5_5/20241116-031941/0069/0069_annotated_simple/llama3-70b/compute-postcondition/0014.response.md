Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in string `s`. The balance is equal to `x`. If the balance is equal to x, the program prints the value of `n + 1`. If the balance is not equal to x, the program checks if the difference between `x` and balance is divisible by the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If it is divisible, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of the expression (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
