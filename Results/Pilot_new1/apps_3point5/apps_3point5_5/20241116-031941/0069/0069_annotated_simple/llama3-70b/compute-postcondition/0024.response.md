Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is n + 1, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in string `s`, the balance is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is updated based on the occurrences of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is updated based on the occurrences of '1' in `s`. After the execution of the if else block, the program will output n + 2 if balance is equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is 0, then -1 will be printed. Otherwise, the program will print ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the calculations and outputs of the if else block.***
