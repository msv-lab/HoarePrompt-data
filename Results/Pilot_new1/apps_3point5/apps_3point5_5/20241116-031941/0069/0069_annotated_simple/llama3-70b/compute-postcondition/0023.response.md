Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is n + 1, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in string `s`, the balance is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned the values from the input split as integers, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is updated based on the occurrences of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is updated based on the occurrences of '1' in `s`. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This accounts for all possible scenarios and edge cases involving the calculations and outputs of the if else block.***
