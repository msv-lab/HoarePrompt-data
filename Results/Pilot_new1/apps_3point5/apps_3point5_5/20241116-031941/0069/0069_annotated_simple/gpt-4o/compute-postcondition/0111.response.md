Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` list has at least `n + 3` elements, `n` is an integer value, `balance` is not equal to 0, each element `prefix_balances[i]` is updated as specified, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3. `count` is assigned the value 1 if (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and the result is greater than or equal to 0. After the execution of the if statement, `count` is increased by 1 if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is met, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.***
