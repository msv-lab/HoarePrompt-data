According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the upper limit of the range. Therefore, to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **T is greater than 0, n, x, and results remain unchanged, balance is updated based on the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `balance` is updated, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the character at position `i - 1` in string `s`.**
