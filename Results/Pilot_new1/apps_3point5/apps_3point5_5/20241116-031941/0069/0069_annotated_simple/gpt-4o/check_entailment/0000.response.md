Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string itself.
2. It calculates the balance of the string based on the count of '0' and '1'.
3. It then calculates the cumulative balance for prefixes of the string.
4. The program correctly handles the cases where the balance is 0 and where the balance is not 0 by counting the number of prefixes with the desired balance.
5. The output is also correctly formatted as per the problem description.
6. The program logic aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
