Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data[index + 1]` is converted to an integer. The values of `prefix_balances`, `results`, `balance`, `s`, `index`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value**
