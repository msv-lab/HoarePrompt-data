Example Answer:
The `input()` function accepts input and `split()` splits the input based on whitespace. The variables `data` is assigned the list of input values. Since no specific values are given for `n`, `x`, or `s`, the output state is: T is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, x is an integer within the range [-10^9, 10^9], s is a binary string of length n.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, x is an integer within the range [-10^9, 10^9], s is a binary string of length n**
