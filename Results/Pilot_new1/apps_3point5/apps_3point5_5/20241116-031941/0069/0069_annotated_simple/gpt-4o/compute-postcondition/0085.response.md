Example Answer:
The `prefix_balances` list is initialized with `0` values, with a length of `n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value, `prefix_balances` list is initialized with `0` values of length `n + 1`.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` is an integer, `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value, `prefix_balances` list is initialized with `0` values of length `n + 1`**
