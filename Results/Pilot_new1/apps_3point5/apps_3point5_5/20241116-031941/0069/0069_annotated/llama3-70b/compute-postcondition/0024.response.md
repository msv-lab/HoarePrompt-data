Postcondition: ***T, n, x are positive integers. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios where T, n, and x are assigned values based on the input, ensuring the correct output is generated.***
