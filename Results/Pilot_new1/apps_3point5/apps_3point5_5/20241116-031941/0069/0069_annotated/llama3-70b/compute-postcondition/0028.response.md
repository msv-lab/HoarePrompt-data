Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0's and '1's in string `s` respectively. The initial state does not provide information about the string `s`, so the output state will be: T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0's and '1's in string `s`.
Output State: **T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0's and '1's in string `s`**
