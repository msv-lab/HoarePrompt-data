Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for each test case, calculates the balance of the string, and then determines the number of prefixes with the desired balance as specified in the problem description.
- The code handles cases where the number of prefixes is infinite by printing -1.
- The annotations provide a clear summary of the program's logic and the expected output based on the input values.
- The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for each test case.
