Example Answer:
The input is stored in variable `s`. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input.
Output State: **T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input**
