Example Answer:
The code prints `n + 1`, where the value of `n` is based on the input. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, the balance is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the balance is equal to `x`, and `n + 1` is printed.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, the balance is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the balance is equal to `x`, and `n + 1` is printed**
