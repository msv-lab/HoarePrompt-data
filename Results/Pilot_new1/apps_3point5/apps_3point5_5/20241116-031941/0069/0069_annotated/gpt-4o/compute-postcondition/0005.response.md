According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which is converted to an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0. 
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
