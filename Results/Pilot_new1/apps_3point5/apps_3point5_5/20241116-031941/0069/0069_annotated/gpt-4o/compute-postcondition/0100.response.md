Postcondition: ***If the string `s` contains at least one character, the loop will execute and update the `prefix_balances` array based on the conditions provided. The `balance` will be assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`. If the string `s` is empty, the loop will not execute and `balance` will retain its initial value. In this case, the balance will not be equal to 0.***
