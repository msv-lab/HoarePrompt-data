Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the values in `s` based on the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `n` is at least 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by the number of loop iterations, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2 + 3 * (number of loop iterations)` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3 for each loop iteration. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros. After the if else block executes, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, the `results` list appends -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, a new element with the value 0 is appended to the `results` list.***
