Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, the `prefix_balances` list contains cumulative sums of values in `s` based on the specified condition. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros. If `balance` is 0, `results` appends -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise, it appends 0. If `balance` is not 0, `prefix_balances` has at least `n + 1` elements, and `x`, `s`, `index`, and `n` are updated based on loop iterations. The `count` variable, initialized to 0, is incremented by 1 for each element in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. The loop does not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 0, in which case `prefix_balances` remains a list of `n + 1` zeros. The `results` list has the final count of valid elements appended to it.***
