Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the calculation of the number of prefixes with a balance equal to x. The code does not handle all scenarios correctly, especially when dealing with cases where there is an infinite number of prefixes.

For example, in the test case where n = 2 and x = 0, and s = "01", the code should output -1 since there is an infinite number of prefixes with a balance of 0. However, the code incorrectly outputs 0 in this case.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness of the code false. The annotations did mention that the code handles edge cases such as negative values and empty strings, but it failed to accurately address the scenario of infinite prefixes.
