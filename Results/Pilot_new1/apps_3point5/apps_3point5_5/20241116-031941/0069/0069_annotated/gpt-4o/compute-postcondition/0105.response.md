Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, `count` is increased by 1. `prefix_balances` is not empty, and `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`. The postcondition covers the case where `x` is an integer, and the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance`, and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0.***
