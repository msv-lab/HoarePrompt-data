Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized with `n + 1` elements, each element being `0`. The `balance` variable is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`.
Output State: **`balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`**
