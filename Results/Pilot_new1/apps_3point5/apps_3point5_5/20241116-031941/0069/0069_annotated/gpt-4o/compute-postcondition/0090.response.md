According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated. 

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to be equal to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
