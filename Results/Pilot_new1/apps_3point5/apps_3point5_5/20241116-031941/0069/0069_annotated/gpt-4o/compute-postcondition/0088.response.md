According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the conditions**
