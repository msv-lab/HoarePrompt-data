According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros
- `n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`
- `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1
- `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`
- `index` is incremented by 3

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `n` is at least 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3**
