Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements. `x`, `s`, `index`, `n` are updated based on loop iterations. `count` is an integer, initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 if the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is met. The condition checks if the difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
