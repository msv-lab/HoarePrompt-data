According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 2` zeros, `n` is at least 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 2, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 5` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3. 
To execute the loop one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 2` zeros, `n` is at least 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 2, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 5` in the list `data`, `index` is incremented by 3, `i` is incremented by 1**
