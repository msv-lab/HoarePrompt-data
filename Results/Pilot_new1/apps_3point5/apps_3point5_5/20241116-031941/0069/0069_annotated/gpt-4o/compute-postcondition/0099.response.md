Postcondition: ***`s` contains at least one character, the loop has executed and updated the `prefix_balances` array. `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`. If the value of `x` is found in the `prefix_balances` array, then -1 is appended to the `results` array. If `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` array, then 0 is appended to the `results` array. This covers all possible scenarios after the execution of the if else block.***
