Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is a variable representing the index. The value at the index position is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. Other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`**
