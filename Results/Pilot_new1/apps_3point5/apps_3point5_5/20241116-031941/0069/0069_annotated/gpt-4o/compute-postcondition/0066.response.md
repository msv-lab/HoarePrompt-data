Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least `n + 1` elements, `x` is updated based on loop iterations, `s` is updated based on loop iterations, `index` is incremented by 3 for each loop iteration, `n` is at least 1, `count` is 0. The difference between `x` and `b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0.***
