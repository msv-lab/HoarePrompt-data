The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` lists of integers. It extracts all the digits from these lists, removes the digit '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them into a single number, and prints the maximum possible number that can be formed from these digits. The functionality does not ensure that the generated number represents the faces of a cube as mentioned in the annotations.
