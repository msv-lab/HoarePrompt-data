Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representations of the digits in the cube list. Since the cubes list contains at least 3 cubes, and the digits set already contains the string representations of the digits in the first cube, the set `digits` will be updated with the string representations of the digits in the remaining cubes. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in all cubes**
