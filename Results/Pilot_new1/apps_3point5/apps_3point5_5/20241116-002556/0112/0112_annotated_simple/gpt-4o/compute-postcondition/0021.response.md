Output State: 
- If `n` is greater than 0 and there exists an index `i` such that `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit in cube_faces[i]`, then the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `used_cubes` will be a list with `True` values at specific indices, `digits` will remain non-empty, `digit` will be the first element in `digits`, and `found` will be `True`. The loop will terminate once the condition is met, and `i` will be the index where the condition was satisfied.
- If there is no index `i` such that the condition `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit in cube_faces[i]` is met, the loop will not execute, and all variables will retain their initial values.
- Therefore, the output state is that `used_cubes` will have `True` values at specific indices, `digits` will remain non-empty, `digit` will be the first element in `digits`, and `found` will be `True` if the condition is met. If the condition is never satisfied, `found` will remain `False`, and the loop will not execute.
Output State: **If there exists an index i such that not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i], then used_cubes will have True values at specific indices, digits will remain non-empty, digit will be the first element in digits, and found will be True. If no such index exists, found will be False, and the loop will not execute.**
