Functionality: ** The function `can_form_number` takes a positive integer `num` as input, representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers. The function iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if there exists a cube face that can represent each digit. If a cube face is found for each digit, the function returns True. If any digit cannot be represented by a cube face, the function returns False. **

The code does follow the annotations provided, where it iterates through the digits of the input number and checks if each digit can be represented by a cube face. If all digits can be represented, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
