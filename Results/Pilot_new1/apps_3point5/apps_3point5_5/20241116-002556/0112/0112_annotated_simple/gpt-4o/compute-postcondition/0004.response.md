According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the list `used_cubes` has `n` elements, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, and `found` is `False`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be set to 0.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with a length of `n`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0**
