According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits in the list to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, and there are more digits in the list to iterate through. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`found` is False, there are more digits in the list to iterate through**
