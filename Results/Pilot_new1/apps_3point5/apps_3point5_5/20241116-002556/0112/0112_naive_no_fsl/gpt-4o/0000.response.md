Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of cubes and the faces of each cube.
2. The `func_1` function correctly determines if Masha can form a number using the given cubes by iterating through the digits of the number and checking if the digit is present on any face of the available cubes.
3. The program then iterates through numbers starting from 1 and checks if Masha can form the number, incrementing the number until she can't form the next number.
4. The program returns the maximum number x that Masha can form using the given cubes, which aligns with the problem description.
5. The program handles the case where Masha can't form even number 1 by returning 0.

Overall, the program logic is correct and aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
