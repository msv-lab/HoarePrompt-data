According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, all elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, and `found` is False. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0.
State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
