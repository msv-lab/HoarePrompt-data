According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is `True`, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration after the if else block executes. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is `True`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration after the if else block executes**.
