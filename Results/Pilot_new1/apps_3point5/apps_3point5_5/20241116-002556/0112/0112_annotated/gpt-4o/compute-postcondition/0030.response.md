Output State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated based on the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]`. The loop will execute at least once if `digits` has at least one element. The variable `found` is True if the condition is satisfied for at least one element, and False otherwise. If `found` remains False after the loop completes all `n` iterations, the program returns False. If the loop does not execute due to an empty `digits` list, no changes occur to `used_cubes`, and `found` remains False.**
