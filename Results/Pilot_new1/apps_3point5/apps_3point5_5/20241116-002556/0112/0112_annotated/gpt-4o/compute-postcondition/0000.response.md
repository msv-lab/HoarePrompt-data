Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting `num` to a string. Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot calculate the exact list of `digits`. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube.**
Output State: **Precondition**: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube.**
