Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and then reads `n` cubes where each cube consists of 6 integers representing the digits on each face. It then extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them to form a number, and prints the maximum number that can be formed. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
