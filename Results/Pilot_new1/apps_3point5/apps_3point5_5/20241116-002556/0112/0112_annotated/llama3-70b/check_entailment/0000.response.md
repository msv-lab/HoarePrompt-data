Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. However, the code does not handle this specific case. The code simply extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them to form a number, and prints the maximum number that can be formed. This means that the code does not take into account the restriction of not being able to make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa, which is a requirement in the problem description.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
