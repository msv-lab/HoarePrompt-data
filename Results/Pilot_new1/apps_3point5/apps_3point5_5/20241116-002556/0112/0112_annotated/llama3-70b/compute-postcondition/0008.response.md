Example Answer:
The code updates the set `digits` by adding the string representation of each digit in the cubes. Since `cubes` contains at least 3 cubes, the set `digits` will be updated with the string representations of digits from these cubes. The previous values of `n`, `cubes`, and `digits` are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes**
