According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of cubes in the list. If there are at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 cubes, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list of cubes must contain at least 3 cubes.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes**
