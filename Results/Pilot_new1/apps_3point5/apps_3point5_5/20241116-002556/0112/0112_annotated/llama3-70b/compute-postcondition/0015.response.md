Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `max_num`, which is assigned the integer value of the sorted digits of the cubes in descending order. The set 'digits' contains the string representation of each digit in the cubes. If '0' is present in 'digits', it is removed. The set 'digits' may or may not contain '0' after the removal operation, depending on its initial presence. Therefore, the output state is: The loop iterates through each cube in the list of cubes and adds the string representation of each digit in the cube to the set 'digits'. If the list of cubes is empty, 'digits' remains an empty set. After the if statement executes, if '0' is present in 'digits', it is removed. The set 'digits' may or may not contain '0' after the removal operation, depending on its initial presence. 'max_num' is assigned the integer value of the sorted digits in descending order, and it is printed.
