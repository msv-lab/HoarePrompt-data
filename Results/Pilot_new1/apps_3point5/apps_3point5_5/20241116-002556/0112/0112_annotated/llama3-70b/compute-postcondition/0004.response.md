Example Answer:
The code iterates over each cube in the list `cubes`, converts each digit of the cube to a string, and updates the `digits` set with these string representations of digits. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of the `cubes` list, the output state will depend on the actual cubes provided. However, given that `n` is an input integer and `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, the output state will be: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, and `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the cubes**
