Example Answer:
The code joins the sorted digits in 'digits' in descending order to form a string and then converts it to an integer, assigning it to 'max_num'. The 'digits' set may or may not contain '0' after the removal operation. Therefore, the output state is: The loop iterates through each cube in the list of cubes and adds the string representation of each digit in the cube to the set 'digits'. If the list of cubes is empty, 'digits' remains an empty set. After the if statement executes, if '0' is present in 'digits', it is removed. The set 'digits' may or may not contain '0' after the removal operation, depending on its initial presence. 'max_num' is assigned the integer value of the sorted digits in descending order.
