Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list of lists named `cubes` by taking `n` inputs where each input is split by space and converted to integers. Since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, the number of inputs will be between 1 and 3 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of lists containing the input values.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing the input values**
