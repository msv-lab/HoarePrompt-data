Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then converting that string into a list. The value of `num` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact list of characters in `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string**
