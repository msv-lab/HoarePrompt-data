Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The other variables `used_cubes` (list of `n` elements) and `digit` (progresses through the characters in `digits`) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`.
Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`**
