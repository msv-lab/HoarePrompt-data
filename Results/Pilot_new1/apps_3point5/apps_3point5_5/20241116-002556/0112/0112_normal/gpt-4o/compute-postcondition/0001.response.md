Example Answer:
A list `used_cubes` is created with `n` elements, and each element is initialized as `False`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so the exact size of the list is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`**
