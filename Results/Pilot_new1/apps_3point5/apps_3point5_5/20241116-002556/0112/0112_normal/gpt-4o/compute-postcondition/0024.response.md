Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element is True if the corresponding cube face contains the current `digit`. `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any cube face, otherwise False. `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False. If the condition is not met in the loop and `found` is False, the program returns False.***
