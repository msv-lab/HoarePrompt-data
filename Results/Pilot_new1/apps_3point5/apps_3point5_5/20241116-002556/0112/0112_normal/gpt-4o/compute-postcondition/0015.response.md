According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, and `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the correct cube is marked as used, the search is successful, and the loop is exited as intended. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is False. All other variables maintain their initial values and relationships.**
