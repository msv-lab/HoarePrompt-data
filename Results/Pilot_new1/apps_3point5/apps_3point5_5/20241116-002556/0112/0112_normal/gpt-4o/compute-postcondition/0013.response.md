Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is less than the length of the `digits` list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
