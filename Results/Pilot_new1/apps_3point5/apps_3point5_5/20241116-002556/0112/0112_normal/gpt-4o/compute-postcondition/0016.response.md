Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in the `used_cubes` list is set to True. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is False.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is False**
