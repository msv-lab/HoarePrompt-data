According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more characters left in `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`. To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to progress to the next character in `digits`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `digit` progresses to the next character in `digits`.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses to the next character in `digits`**
