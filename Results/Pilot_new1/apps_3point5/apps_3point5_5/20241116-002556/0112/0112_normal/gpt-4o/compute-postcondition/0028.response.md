Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the value `False`. The variable `used_cubes` is not affected, and `digit` is not mentioned in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses to the next character in `digits`.
Output State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses to the next character in `digits`**
