According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`. So for the loop to be executed, the `digits` list must have at least 1 character, and `digit` is the first character in the list.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list**
