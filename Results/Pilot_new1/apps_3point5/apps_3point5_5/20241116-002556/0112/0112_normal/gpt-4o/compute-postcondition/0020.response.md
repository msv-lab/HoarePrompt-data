According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `digits`. If `i` is less than the length of `digits`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is True after the execution of the if statement. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is exited. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and if `i` is less than the length of `digits`, the loop can execute again.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is True after the execution of the if statement, `i` is incremented by 1**
