Example Answer:
The `digits` set is updated with the digits of the second cube `cube`. The previous value of `digits` contains the digits of the second cube. After updating, the `digits` set will now contain the digits of the second cube along with any additional digits from the update operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `cube` is the second cube in the list, and `digits` is a set containing the digits of the second cube along with any additional digits from the update operation.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `cube` is the second cube in the list, and `digits` is a set containing the digits of the second cube along with any additional digits from the update operation**
