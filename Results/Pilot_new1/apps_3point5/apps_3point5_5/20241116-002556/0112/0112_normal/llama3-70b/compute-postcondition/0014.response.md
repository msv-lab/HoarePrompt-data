Example Answer:
The code converts the set `digits` into a sorted string in descending order, then converts it into an integer and assigns it to `max_num`. The value of `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all cubes without '0'. After the if statement, '0' is removed from the set `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: If cubes is a list with at least one cube, the loop executes and digits is a set containing all the digits from all cubes without '0'. If cubes is an empty list, the loop does not execute and digits remains an empty set without '0', and `max_num` is the integer value of sorted digits in descending order.
Output State: **If cubes is a list with at least one cube, the loop executes and digits is a set containing all the digits from all cubes without '0'. If cubes is an empty list, the loop does not execute and digits remains an empty set without '0', and `max_num` is the integer value of sorted digits in descending order.**
