According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 2 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, cube is the first cube in the list, digits is a set containing the digits of the first cube. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 cubes and cube should be the second cube in the list with a new set of digits.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, `cube` is the second cube in the list, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the second cube**
