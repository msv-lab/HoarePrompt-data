Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not take into account the constraint that Masha can't make the digit 6 from the digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may generate incorrect results for cases where the digits 6 and 9 are present on the cubes. The output hints do not mention this constraint, so it is important to note that the code is not handling this specific case.
