According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, cube is the second cube in the list, and digits is a set containing the digits of the second cube along with any additional digits from the update operation. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 cubes, and the cube should be the third cube in the list with updated digits.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, `cube` is the third cube in the list, and `digits` is a set containing the digits of the third cube along with any additional digits from the update operation**
