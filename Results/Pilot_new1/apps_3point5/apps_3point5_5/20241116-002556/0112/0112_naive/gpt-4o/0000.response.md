Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where Masha cannot make any number from 1 to x using the cubes provided. This is evident in the fact that the program does not output 0 when Masha cannot form any numbers. The program only outputs the maximum number x that can be formed, but it does not handle the case where no numbers can be formed.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
