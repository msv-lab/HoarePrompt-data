Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is between 1 and 1000 due to the precondition. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` and `c` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
