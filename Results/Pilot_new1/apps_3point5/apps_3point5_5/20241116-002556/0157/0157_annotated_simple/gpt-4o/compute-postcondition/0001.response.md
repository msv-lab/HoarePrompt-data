Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables `a` and `c` are not affected, so the output state is: `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
