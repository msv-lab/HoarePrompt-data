Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that a is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, the output state is `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000**
