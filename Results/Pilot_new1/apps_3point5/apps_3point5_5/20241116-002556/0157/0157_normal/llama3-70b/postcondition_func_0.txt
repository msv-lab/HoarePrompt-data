The function `func` prompts the user to input three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then calculates the minimum amount of lemons that can be bought based on the inputs. The function does not return any value, it only prints the total cost of the lemons purchased. The function assumes that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 1000.
