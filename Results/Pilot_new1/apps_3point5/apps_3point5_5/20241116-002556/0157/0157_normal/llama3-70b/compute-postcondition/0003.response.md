Example Answer: 
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. After calculation, `min_lemon` will hold the smallest value among the three divisions. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**
