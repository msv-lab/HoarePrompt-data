Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet found in the input string `s`, it replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet and adds the replaced character to the result string `res`. If `res` contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The code handles the scenario where the input string `s` can be transformed into a string containing the English alphabet as a subsequence. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the requirements specified in the problem description.
