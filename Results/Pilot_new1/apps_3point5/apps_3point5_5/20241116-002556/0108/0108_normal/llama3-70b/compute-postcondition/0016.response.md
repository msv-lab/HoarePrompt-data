Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet, and the replacement is done only once. The modified `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet. The character that was replaced will be added to the end of `res`. The previous values of `s` and `res` are unknown, so the output state is: `s` is modified with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` has additional characters added from that character, and that character is added to the end of `res`.
Output State: **`s` is modified with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` has additional characters added from that character, and that character is added to the end of `res`**
