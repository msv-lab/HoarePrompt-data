Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in `alphabet` after the last character checked in the loop, then `s` will be modified with the first occurrence of that character replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` will have additional characters added from that character, and that character will be added to the end of `res`.
Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in `alphabet` after the last character checked in the loop, then `s` will be modified with the first occurrence of that character replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` will have additional characters added from that character, and that character will be added to the end of `res`**
