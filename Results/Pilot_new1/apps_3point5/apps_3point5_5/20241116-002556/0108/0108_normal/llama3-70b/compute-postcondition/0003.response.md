According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet` variable. If `alphabet` is a valid iterable, the loop can execute. Since `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, it is not directly related to the loop execution. The `res` being an empty string also does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `alphabet` should be a valid iterable.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
