The variable `res` is assigned an empty string. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string**
