Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res`, so the value of `res` would be the previous value of `res` plus the ASCII value of `char`. The value of `s` is updated with the character one position ahead of `char` in the ASCII table. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, `res` is adjusted accordingly, `char` is the character one position behind the updated `char` in the ASCII table.
Output State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, `res` is adjusted accordingly, `char` is the character one position behind the updated `char` in the ASCII table**
