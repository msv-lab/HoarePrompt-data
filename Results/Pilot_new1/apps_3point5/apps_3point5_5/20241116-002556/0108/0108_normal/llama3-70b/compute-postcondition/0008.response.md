Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the `alphabet`. The length of `s` is between 1 and 10^5, and `res` is a string with an additional character. The `alphabet` is a valid iterable. 
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` is a string with an additional character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
