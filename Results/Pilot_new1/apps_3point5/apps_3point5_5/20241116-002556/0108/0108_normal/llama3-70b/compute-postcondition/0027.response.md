Example Answer:
The `char` in `s` is replaced with the character that is one position ahead in the ASCII table. The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character obtained by adding 1 to the ASCII value of `char`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, and `res` is adjusted accordingly.
Output State: **`s` is updated with `char` replaced by the character one position ahead in the ASCII table, `res` is adjusted accordingly**
