The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user and iterates through the alphabet. For each character in the alphabet found in the input string `s`, it replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet and adds the replaced character to the result string `res`. If `res` contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any specific value.
