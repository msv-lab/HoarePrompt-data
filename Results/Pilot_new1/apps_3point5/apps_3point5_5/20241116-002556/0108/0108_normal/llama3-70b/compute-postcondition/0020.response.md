According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the states are dependent on the initial values of `s`, `res`, and `char`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the `char` must still be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **Depends on the initial values of `s`, `res`, and `char`**
