Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string and the target string to check if the input string can be transformed into a subsequence of the target string. If it can, it prints the target string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program is correct and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
