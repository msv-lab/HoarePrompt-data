Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program iterates through the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and checks if the characters match. If all characters in the target string are found in the input string in order, it prints the target string. If not, it prints -1. This logic correctly follows the problem description and will output the correct result for all potential cases.
