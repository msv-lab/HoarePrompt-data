According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, the loop will execute for each letter. Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty string, so no adjustments are needed for `res`. The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the `alphabet` string to iterate over. 
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is an empty string**
