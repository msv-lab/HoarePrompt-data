According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the alphabet. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is the last character that was processed in the loop. To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the alphabet. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If the loop executes at least once, `res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end. If the loop does not execute, `res` remains the same as the initial state. `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last processed character in the loop.**
