According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if the string `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char`, then `s` is modified accordingly. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` needs to be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If the string `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char`, then `s` is a string with all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters; `res` is a string with all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end. `res` is appended with `char`.**
