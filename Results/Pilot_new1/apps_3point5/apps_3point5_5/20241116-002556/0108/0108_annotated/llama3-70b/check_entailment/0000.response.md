Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` and processes it character by character to transform it into a subsequence of the English alphabet. It replaces each character in `s` with the next character in alphabetical order until it forms the sequence 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If successful, it prints the resulting sequence, otherwise, it prints -1. The code logic aligns with the problem description, handling all potential cases as described. The annotations provide a clear summary of the code's behavior, confirming that it follows the problem requirements.
