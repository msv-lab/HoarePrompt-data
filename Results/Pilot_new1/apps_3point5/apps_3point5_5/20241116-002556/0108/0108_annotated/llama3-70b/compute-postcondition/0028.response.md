According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end. This means the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` should be present in `s` for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end**
