According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than len(s) + 1, and `j` is less than 26. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than len(s) + 2 and `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than 27.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than len(s) + 2, `j` is less than 27**
