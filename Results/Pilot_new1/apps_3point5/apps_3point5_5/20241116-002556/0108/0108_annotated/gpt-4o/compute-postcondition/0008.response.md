According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1. Since `i` is less than the length of string `s`, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to ensure the loop can execute one more time.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, `j` is incremented by 1**
