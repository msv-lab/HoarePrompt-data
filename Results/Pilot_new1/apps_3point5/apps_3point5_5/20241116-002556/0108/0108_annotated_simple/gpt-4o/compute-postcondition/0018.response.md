Postcondition: ***If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then `i` will be incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` will be incremented to 26. Otherwise, if `j` is not equal to `target_len`, then `i` will be incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than 26. If the length of `s` is less than 26, `i` will be incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is empty, both `i` and `j` will remain 0.***
