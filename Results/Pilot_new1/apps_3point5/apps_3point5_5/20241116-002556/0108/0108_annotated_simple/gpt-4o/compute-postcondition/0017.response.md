Output State: **If the characters in `s` match the characters in `target` in order, `i` will be incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` will be incremented to 26. If `s` does not contain the characters in `target` in order, `i` will be incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than 26. If the length of `s` is less than 26, `i` will be incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` will be less than 26. If `s` is empty, both `i` and `j` will remain 0.**
