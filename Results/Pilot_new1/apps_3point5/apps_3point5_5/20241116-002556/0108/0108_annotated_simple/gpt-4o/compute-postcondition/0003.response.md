`i` and `j` are both assigned the value 0. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
