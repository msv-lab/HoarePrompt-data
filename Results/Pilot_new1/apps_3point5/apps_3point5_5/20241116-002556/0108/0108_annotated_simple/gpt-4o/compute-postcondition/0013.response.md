Example Answer: 
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is increased by 1.
