Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced once with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence. The replaced character is back in `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
