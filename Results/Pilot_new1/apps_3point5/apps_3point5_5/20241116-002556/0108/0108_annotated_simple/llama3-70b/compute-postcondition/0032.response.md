Example Answer: 
`res` has the first character of `char` added in each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`. The value of `char` remains the same, and `alphabet` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If `char` is in `s`, `res` has the first character added for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable.
Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, `res` has the first character added for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable**
