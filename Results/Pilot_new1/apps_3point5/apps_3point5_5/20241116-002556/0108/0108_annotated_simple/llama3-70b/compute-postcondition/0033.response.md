Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The replacement only occurs once. The loop will continue until `char` is no longer in `s`. The state of `alphabet` is not affected. 
Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, `res` has the first character added for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable**
