Example Answer:
The code snippet appends the value of `char` twice to the variable `res`. As `char` is in `s`, it means that `char` is the first character of `s`. Since `s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, adding `char` twice will result in the first character being added twice. Therefore, the output state is: `s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added twice, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable, and `char` is in `s.
Output State: **`s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added twice, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable, and `char` is in `s**
