Example Answer:
`char` is added to `res` for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`. `s` has its first character replaced once and then back to its original value. `alphabet` remains a valid iterable. 
Output State: **If `char` is in `s`, `s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable.**
