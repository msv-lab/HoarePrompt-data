Example Answer:
The `replace` method replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. Since `s` has its first character replaced once and then back to its original value, the overall effect is no change in `s`. The `res` variable has the first character added. The `alphabet` variable remains a valid iterable. 
Output State: **`s` has the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` has the first character added, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable**
