Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. Since the values are within the specified range, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
