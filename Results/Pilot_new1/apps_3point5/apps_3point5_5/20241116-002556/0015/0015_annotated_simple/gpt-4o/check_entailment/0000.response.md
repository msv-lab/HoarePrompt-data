Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes three integers a, b, and c as input. It then checks if b is equal to a, if so, it prints 'YES' since b appears in the sequence. If b is not equal to a, it then checks if c is equal to 0, if so, it prints 'NO' since b cannot appear in the sequence with a difference of 0. If c is not 0, it further checks if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, if so, it prints 'YES' as b can be reached in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
