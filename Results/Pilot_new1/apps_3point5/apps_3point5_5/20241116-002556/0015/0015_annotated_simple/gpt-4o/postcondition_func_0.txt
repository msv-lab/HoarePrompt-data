The function `func` reads three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks various conditions based on these values. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not 0, and the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters. The integer values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
