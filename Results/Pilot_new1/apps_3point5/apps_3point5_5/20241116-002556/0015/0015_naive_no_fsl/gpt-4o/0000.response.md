Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. If Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence (b == a), then the program correctly prints 'YES'.
2. If the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c == 0), then the program correctly prints 'NO'.
3. If the favorite number b can be reached from the first element a by adding multiples of the difference c and the result is non-negative ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0), then the program correctly prints 'YES'.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, the program correctly prints 'NO'. 

Therefore, the program handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and is correct.
