Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly determines whether Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence s. The program first checks if the difference between a and b is divisible by c and if the result is non-negative. If these conditions are met, it prints "YES", indicating that b appears in the sequence. Otherwise, it prints "NO". 

For all the provided examples, the program produces the correct output:
1. For the input 1 7 3, the sequence starts from 1, 4, 7, so 7 is its element. Therefore, the output should be "YES", which the program correctly prints.
2. For the input 10 10 0, the favorite integer of Vasya is equal to the first element of the sequence, so the output should be "YES", which the program correctly prints.
3. For the input 1 -4 5, all elements of the sequence are greater than Vasya's favorite integer (-4), so the output should be "NO", which the program correctly prints.
4. For the input 0 60 50, the sequence starts from 0, 50, 100, and all the following elements are greater than Vasya's favorite integer (60), so the output should be "NO", which the program correctly prints.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program is correct.
