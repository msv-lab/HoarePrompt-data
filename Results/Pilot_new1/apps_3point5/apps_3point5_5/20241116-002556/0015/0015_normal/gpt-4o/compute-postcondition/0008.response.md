Example Answer:
The code snippet `print('YES')` does not affect the initial state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. `b` is not equal to `a`. `c` is not equal to 0. The difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of dividing `b` minus `a` by `c` is a non-negative integer.**
