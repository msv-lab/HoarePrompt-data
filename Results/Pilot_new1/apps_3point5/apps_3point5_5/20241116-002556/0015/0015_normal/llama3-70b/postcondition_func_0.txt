The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division is non-negative. If the condition is met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
