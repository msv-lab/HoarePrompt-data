Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, the values can vary. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input splitting.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input splitting**
