Postcondition: ***`a, b, c` are integers assigned based on user input, where the value of `c` is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is not met, 'NO' is printed. In all cases, the values of `a, b, c` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
