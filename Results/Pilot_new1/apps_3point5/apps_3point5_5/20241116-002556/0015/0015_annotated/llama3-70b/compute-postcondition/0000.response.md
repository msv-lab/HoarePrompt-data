Example Answer:
`a, b, c` are assigned the values from `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` splits the input by spaces and `map(int, ...)` converts each part to an integer. The values of `a, b, c` are now determined by the input provided.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are assigned integer values based on user input**
