Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input. `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. This if else block covers all possible scenarios based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring the correct output 'YES' or 'NO' is displayed.***
