Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the number of unique digits in an integer is less than or equal to a given value `k`.
2. The `func_2` function correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits.
3. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description provided.
4. The code handles the modulo operation as required in the problem description.
5. The code iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r` and correctly checks each number for the condition specified.
6. The code returns the correct sum of numbers that meet the condition specified in the problem statement.
