Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` is less than `r`, and `num` is the next integer value after the previous iteration. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated as specified. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged.***
