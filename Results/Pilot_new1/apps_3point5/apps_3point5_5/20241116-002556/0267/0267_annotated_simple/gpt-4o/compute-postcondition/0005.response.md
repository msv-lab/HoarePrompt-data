According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to be the sum of the current `total_sum` and `num`, modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged, with `l` being less than or equal to `r`, and `num` retains its initial value of `l`. There are no changes if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `l` is less than `r`.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `l` is less than `r`, `num` retains its initial value of `l`**
