Example Answer:
The `total_sum` is updated by adding the current value of `num` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum` and `num` are known integers. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than `r`, and `num` is the next integer value after the previous iteration**
