Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding a calculated value. The calculation involves `n`, `k`, and `i`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, the value of `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10, and `i` starts at 1 and is less than `k`. The output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[n, k]` after the calculation.
Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value**
