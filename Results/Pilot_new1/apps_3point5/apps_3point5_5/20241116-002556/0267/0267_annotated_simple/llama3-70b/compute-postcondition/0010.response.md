According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `k`. Therefore, before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `k`. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, the initial value of `i` should be 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store intermediate results, `i` is 1 and `i` is less than `k`**
