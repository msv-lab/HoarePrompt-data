Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store intermediate results. If k is equal to 0, the program returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, then the program returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. Additionally, n is less than 10 to the power of k***
