According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is increased by 1, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to `k+1`.
State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to `k+1**.
