According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is incremented by 1**
