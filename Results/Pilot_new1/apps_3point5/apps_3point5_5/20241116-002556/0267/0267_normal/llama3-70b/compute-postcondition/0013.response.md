Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)). The variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value, `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value, `i` is increased by 1**
