Example Answer:
`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is not defined, and `k` is a positive integer greater than 1. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value**
