According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it should be adjusted to `i` is increased by 2.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new value, `i` is increased by 2**
