According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, so these values do not affect the loop execution directly. However, the loop will not execute if `k` is 1 or less, as the range will be empty. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` being 9 does not impact the loop execution.

Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, we need to set `k` to a value greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value 9**
