The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. After executing the function body, the program returns the sum of all numbers 'num' in the range [l, r] such that 'func_1(num, k)' returns true, modulo MOD. If the loop doesn't execute, 'total_sum' remains 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition specified by 'func_1(num, k)', modulo MOD. If the loop doesn't execute, the function returns 0.
