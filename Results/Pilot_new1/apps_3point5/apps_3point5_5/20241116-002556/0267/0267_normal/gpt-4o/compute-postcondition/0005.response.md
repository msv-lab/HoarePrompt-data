According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `num` is within the range of `l` to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is equal to `l`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged and `l` is still less than or equal to `r`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `num` needs to be considered. Since `l` is the current value of `num`, the next value of `num` should be `l + 1`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` where `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, `l` is incremented to `l + 1`, and `num` is set to `l + 1`**
