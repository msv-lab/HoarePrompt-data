Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` are not changed, and `i` is less than `k`. After execution, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` will be stored in `dp`, and the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` has the updated value for key (n, k), and `i` is less than `k`**
