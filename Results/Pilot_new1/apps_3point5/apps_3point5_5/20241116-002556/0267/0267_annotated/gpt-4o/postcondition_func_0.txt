The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer. It returns True if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k; otherwise, it returns False. The function calculates the number of unique digits in n by converting it to a string, creating a set from the string to get unique digits, and then checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to k.
