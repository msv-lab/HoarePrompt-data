Output State: **If n is divisible by x then the loop does not execute. If n is not divisible by x, n is the next multiple of x greater than the initial n, k remains the same, x is the next higher value in the sequence {10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000} after the previous value of x where n % x != 0**
