Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8. Depending on the value of `k`, `x` will be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
