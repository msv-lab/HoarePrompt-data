The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user input, calculates the next multiple of 10 raised to the power of `k` greater than or equal to `n`, and prints this result. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to find and display the next multiple of 10^k that is greater than or equal to `n`.
