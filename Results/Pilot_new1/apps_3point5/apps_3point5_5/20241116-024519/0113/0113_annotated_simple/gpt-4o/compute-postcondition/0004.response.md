Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k. It calculates the value of 'x' using the formula n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), where multiplier is calculated as 10 raised to the power of k. The function then returns the result x. **

Potential Edge Case: 
- The function assumes that the parameter `k` is an integer, but it does not explicitly check for this condition. If `k` is not an integer, the function may not behave as expected.
- The function uses the `math.gcd()` function, but it does not import the math library explicitly. If the math library is not imported, the function will raise an error when trying to execute `math.gcd()`.
