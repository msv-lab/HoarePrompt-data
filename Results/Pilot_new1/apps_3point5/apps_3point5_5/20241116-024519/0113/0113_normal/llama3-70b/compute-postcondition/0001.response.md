Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is an integer between 0 and 8. The value of `k` can be any integer between 0 and 8, so `x` will be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
