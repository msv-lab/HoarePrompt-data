Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8**
