Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated as `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` is unknown in the initial state, but `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The result of the calculation depends on the value of `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the Output State is: `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and `x` is the result of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`.
Output State: **`multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and `x` is the result of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`**
