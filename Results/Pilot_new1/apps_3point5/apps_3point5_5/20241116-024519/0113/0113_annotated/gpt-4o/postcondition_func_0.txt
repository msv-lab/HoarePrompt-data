The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates the value of `multiplier` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, then computes the updated value of `x` by multiplying `n` with the result of dividing `multiplier` by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. The function returns this updated value of `x`.
