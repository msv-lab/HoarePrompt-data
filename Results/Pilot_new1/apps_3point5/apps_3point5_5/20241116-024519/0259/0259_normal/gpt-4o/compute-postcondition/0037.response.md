According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, all variables `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i`, `wait_time` have been updated based on the loop calculations and assignments. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration. All other variables should retain their updated values from the previous iteration.
State: **`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i+1`, `wait_time` are all updated based on loop calculations and assignments.**
