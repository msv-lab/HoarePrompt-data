Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is equal to the calculated `wait_time` value based on the conditions and calculations performed in the program, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to the calculated `wait_time` value based on the conditions and calculations performed in the program, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
