Example Answer:
The `wait_time` variable is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The value of `d_i` is assigned from `bus_routes[i]`, `t` is not given, and `s_i` is also assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. The output state after the execution of this code will be dependent on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`**
