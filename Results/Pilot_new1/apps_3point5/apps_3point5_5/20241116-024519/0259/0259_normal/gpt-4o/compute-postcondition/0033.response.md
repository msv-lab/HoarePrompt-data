Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i`, `wait_time` are all updated based on loop calculations and assignments. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The program maintains the updated values of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the calculation of `wait_time`.***
