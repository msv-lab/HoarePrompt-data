Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the bus route. Since `i` starts from 0, `chosen_route` will be the index of the bus route incremented by 1. The previous value of `chosen_route` is -1, so after execution, `chosen_route` will be the index of the bus route incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is the value of `wait_time` which is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the value of `wait_time` which is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
