Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `i`, `wait_time` are all updated based on loop calculations and assignments. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_wait_time` and the calculated `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. All other variables retain their updated values based on the loop calculations and assignments, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the calculation of `wait_time`.***
