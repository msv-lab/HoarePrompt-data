Output State: 
- `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes. 
- `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1. 
- `n` is greater than 0. 
- `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. 
- The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions mentioned in the loop code. 
- If the calculated `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to this new value and `chosen_route` is set to the index of the current bus route incremented by 1. 
- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. 
- If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, while `chosen_route` remains -1.
