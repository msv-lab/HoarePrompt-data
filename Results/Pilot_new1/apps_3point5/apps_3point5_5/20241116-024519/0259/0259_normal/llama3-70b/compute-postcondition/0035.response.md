Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for the number of buses `n` and the target time `t`, then reads `n` tuples of start time `s` and duration `d` for each bus. It calculates the minimum time difference between the target time `t` and the arrival time of each bus, and prints the index of the bus with the minimum time difference plus 1. If no input is provided or `n` is 0, the function does not execute the loops and does not print anything.**
