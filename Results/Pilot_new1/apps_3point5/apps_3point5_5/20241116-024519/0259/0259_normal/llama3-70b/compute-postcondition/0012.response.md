Output State: **If n is between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and input is provided for each iteration, then after the loop executes, buses will contain all the tuples (s, d) appended in each iteration. If n is 0 or not provided as input, the loop won't execute and buses will remain an empty list.**
