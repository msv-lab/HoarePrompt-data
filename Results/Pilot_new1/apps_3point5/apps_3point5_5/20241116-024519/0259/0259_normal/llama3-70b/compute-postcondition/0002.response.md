According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Before the loop starts, the `buses` list is empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `buses` is still an empty list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
