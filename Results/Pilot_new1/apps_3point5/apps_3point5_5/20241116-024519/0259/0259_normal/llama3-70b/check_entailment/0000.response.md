Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input for the number of bus routes and the target time correctly.
- It then reads the start time and duration for each bus route and stores them in a list of tuples.
- It calculates the minimum time difference between the target time and the arrival time of each bus route.
- Finally, it prints the index of the bus route with the minimum time difference plus 1.
- The code follows the problem description for every potential case, as it correctly determines which bus route Serval will use based on the given input.
