Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The previous values of `buses` are not provided, but after the append operation, the new tuple is added to the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 101, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `buses` contains the newly appended tuple along with the existing tuples.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 101, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the newly appended tuple along with the existing tuples**
