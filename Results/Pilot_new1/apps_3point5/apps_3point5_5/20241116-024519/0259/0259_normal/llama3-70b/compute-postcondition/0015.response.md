According to the code, the loop can only execute if the list `buses` has at least one element. The loop iterates over each element in `buses`, so the loop will execute as long as there is at least one tuple in `buses`. Since `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, it does not affect the loop execution. The initial value of `ans` being -1 also does not affect the loop execution.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute:
State: **`min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in `buses`**
