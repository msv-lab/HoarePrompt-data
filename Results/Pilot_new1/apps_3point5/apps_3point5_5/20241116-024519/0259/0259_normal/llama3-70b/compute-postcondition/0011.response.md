According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 101. To execute the loop one more time, `n` should be adjusted to be within the range of 4 to 101. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 4 and 101, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the newly appended tuple along with the existing tuples**
