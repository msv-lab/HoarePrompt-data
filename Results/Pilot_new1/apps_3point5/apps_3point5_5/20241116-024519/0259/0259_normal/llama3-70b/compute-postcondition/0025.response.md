Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the next tuple in `buses` plus 1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, and the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the calculated `time`, and `ans` is set to `i + 1`.***
