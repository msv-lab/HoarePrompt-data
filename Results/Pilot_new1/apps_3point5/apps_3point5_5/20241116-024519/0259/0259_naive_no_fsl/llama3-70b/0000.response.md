Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly takes the input, calculates the time each bus route arrives at the station based on the given time $t$, and then determines which bus route Serval will use by finding the minimum time difference. The program iterates through all bus routes and calculates the time based on the formula provided in the problem description. The bus route with the minimum time difference is chosen as the answer. The program outputs the correct bus route based on the given inputs and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
