Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it has a logical error in the calculation of the wait time for each bus route. The program calculates the wait time incorrectly when the time Serval goes to the station is less than the arrival time of the first bus of a route. This leads to incorrect route selection.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4
```
The correct output should be 1 or 2 since both buses of route 1 and route 2 arrive at time 7. However, the program will incorrectly output 3 because of the mentioned logical error.
