Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. Since the previous values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not affected, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, `d_i` is assigned a value, and `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, `d_i` is assigned a value, and `wait_time` is 0**
