`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, where `i` is a variable with an unknown previous value. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions mentioned, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`**
