Output State: **`min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is a non-negative value. If `s_i` is less than `t`, and if the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, if ((t - s_i) % d_i) != 0, then `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - ((t - s_i) % d_i). If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`**
