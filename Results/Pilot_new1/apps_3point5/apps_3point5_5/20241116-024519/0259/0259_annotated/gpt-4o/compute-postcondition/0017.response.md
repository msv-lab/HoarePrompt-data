According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next iteration.
- `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` will retain their values as they are updated based on the conditions within the loop body, so no adjustment is needed for these variables.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**
