Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0**
