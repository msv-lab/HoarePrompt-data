Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is 0**
