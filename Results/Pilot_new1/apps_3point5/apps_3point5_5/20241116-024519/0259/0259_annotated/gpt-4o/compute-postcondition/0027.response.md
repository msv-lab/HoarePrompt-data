According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is updated based on certain conditions, and `chosen_route` is updated accordingly. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time. `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route.**
