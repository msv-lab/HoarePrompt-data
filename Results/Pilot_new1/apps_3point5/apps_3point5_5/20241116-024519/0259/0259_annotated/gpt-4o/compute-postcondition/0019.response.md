Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The variables `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, and `n` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is the result of `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is the result of `s_i - t`**
