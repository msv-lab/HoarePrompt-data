Example Answer:
The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is dependent on the conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is updated based on the conditions mentioned**
