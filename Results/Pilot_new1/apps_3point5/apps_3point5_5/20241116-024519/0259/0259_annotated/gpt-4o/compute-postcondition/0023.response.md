Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios after the if-else block executes, ensuring the correct handling of different edge cases.***
