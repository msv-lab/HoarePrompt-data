Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code reads the input for the number of buses, the time Serval goes to the station, and the bus schedules. It then calculates the minimum time difference between the current time and the bus schedules, and prints the index of the bus schedule with the minimum time difference. If there are no buses, it prints -1. The code logic aligns with the problem description, and the provided examples also work correctly. Additionally, the annotations provide a clear explanation of the code's behavior, which further confirms that the code is correct.
