Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` will be a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `buses` will contain tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules. If `n` is less than 1 or greater than 100, the loop will not execute, and `buses` will remain empty.**
