Output State: 
- `time`, `min_time`, `ans`, `i` are integers.
- If `buses` is empty, `min_time` remains positive infinity, `ans` remains -1.
- If `buses` contains elements, the loop calculates `time` as `(t - s) % d` for each bus schedule.
- If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.
- If `time` is not less than `min_time`, there are no changes to the values of the variables.
- The program prints the final value of `ans`.
Output State: **Final value of `ans` after the loop calculations.**
