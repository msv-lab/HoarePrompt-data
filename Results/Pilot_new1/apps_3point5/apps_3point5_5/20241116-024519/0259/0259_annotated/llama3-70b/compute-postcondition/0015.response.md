According to the code, the loop can execute if there is at least one bus schedule in the `buses` list. Before the loop starts, the variables `i`, `s`, and `d` need to be initialized based on the first bus schedule in the list. Additionally, `min_time` should be updated to reflect the minimum time value encountered during the loop iterations. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples (s, d) representing bus schedules with at least one schedule, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first bus schedule**
