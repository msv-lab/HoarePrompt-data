Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`**
