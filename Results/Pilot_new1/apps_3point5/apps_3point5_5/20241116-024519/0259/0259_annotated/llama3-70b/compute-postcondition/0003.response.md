Example Answer: 
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. Since the input is not provided in the initial state, the exact values of `s` and `d` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it**
