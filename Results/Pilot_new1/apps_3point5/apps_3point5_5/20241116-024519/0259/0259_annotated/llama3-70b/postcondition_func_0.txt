The function `func` reads input for the number of buses `n`, the time `t`, and the bus schedules `(s, d)` for each bus. It then calculates the minimum time difference between the current time `t` and the bus schedules, and prints the index of the bus schedule with the minimum time difference. If there are no buses, it prints -1. The function does not have a return value.
