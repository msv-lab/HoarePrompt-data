Output State: 
- `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time. 
- `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, where `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1` if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`. 
- The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. 
- If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1. 
- The loop calculates the minimum waiting time for each bus route based on the current time `t` and updates `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` accordingly. 
- `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. 
- The wait time is calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop code. 
- The final `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` values represent the minimum waiting time and the corresponding route chosen after the loop execution.
