Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time. `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`. `i` is less than `n`. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the if else block executes, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `wait_time` and the previous `min_wait_time`. `chosen_route` is set to the index `i + 1` corresponding to the minimum `wait_time`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
