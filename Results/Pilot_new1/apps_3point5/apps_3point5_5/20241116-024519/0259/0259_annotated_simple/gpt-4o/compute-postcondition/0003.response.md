Example Answer:
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`, where `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the value of `i`, which is 0. Therefore, `s_i` and `d_i` will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `bus_routes` at index 0. The initial state of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the first tuple in `bus_routes` at index 0**
