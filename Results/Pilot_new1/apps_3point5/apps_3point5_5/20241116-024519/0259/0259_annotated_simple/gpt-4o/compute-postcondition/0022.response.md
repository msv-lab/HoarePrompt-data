Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
