Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the first tuple in `bus_routes` at index 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, and ((t - s_i) % d_i != 0), `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
