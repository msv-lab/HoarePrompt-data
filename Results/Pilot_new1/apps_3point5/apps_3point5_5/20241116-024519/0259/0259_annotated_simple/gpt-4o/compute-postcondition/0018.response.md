Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are updated accordingly. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time, `chosen_route` is updated based on the comparison with `wait_time`, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned based on the tuple at index `i` in the `bus_routes` list**
