According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple `(s, d)`, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed, the `buses` list must have at least 1 tuple, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is assigned -1, `i` is 0**
