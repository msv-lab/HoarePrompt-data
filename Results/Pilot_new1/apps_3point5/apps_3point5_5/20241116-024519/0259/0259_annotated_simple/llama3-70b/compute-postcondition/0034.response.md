The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is expected to return the number of buses that will be available at the bus stop after `t` minutes based on the bus routes defined by the start time `s_i` and interval between buses `d_i` for each route. The function will calculate the number of buses available at the bus stop after `t` minutes and return this value.
