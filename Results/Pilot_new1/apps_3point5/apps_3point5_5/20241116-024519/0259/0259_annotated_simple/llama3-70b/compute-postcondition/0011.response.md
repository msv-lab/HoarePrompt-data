According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the updated list of tuples with the new tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the updated list of tuples with the new tuple (s, d), `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
