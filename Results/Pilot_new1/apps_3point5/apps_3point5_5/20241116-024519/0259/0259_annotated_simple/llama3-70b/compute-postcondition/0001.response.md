Example Answer: 
An empty list `buses` is created. Since the initial state does not mention any other variables, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified range, `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers within the specified range, `buses` is an empty list**
