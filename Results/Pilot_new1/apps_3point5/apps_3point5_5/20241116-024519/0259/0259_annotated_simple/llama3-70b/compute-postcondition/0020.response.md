Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in the list, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is 0, and `time` is calculated based on the current values of `t`, `s`, and `d`. The function updates `min_time` to the value of `time` and `ans` to `i + 1` if `time` is less than the current `min_time`.***
