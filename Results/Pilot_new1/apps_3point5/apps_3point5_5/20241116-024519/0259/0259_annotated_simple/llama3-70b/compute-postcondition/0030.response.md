Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, buses contains a list of buses with at least 3 tuples, `(s, d)` is the third tuple in the list, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is 3, `i` is 2, `time` is calculated based on the current values of `t`, `s`, and `d. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the new `time` value, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.***
