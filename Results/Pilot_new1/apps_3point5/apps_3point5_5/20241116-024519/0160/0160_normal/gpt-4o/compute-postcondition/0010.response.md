According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` contains divisors based on the conditions mentioned. To execute one more time, the `i` value should be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since `i` starts from 1, the next value would be the current value of `i` + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` is a set. If x is greater than or equal to 1 and x % (i+1) == 0, then `divisors` contains both i+1 and x // (i+1) as divisors of x where i is 2. If x % i == 0, `divisors` is updated to include i and x // i as divisors of x. There are no changes if x % i != 0.**
