# Initial assessment:
The program seems to be designed to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the given sequence after performing a certain number of operations. It uses two functions, one to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of integers and another to calculate all the divisors of a given integer. The main function reads input, calculates the sum of the sequence, finds the greatest common divisor of the sequence, calculates divisors of the sum, and then iterates through the divisors to find the maximum possible positive integer that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

# Checking with Output Hints:
- The output hints describe the functionality of each function accurately.
- The hints provide a clear understanding of what each function is supposed to do and how they contribute to the main goal of finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the sequence.

# Final assessment:
The code seems to follow the problem description for every potential case. It correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the sequence after a certain number of operations. The code structure aligns with the problem requirements, and the functions work as intended based on the hints provided.

Correctness: **True**.
