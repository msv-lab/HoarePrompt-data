Example Answer:
The value of `x` divided by the value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1 and `x` is greater than or equal to 1, the value added to `divisors` is `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing the value of `i` as a divisor of `x`, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the value of `i` as a divisor of `x`, `x` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
