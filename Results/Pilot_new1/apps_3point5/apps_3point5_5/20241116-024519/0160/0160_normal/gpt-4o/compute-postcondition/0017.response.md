The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The precondition for `x` is that it is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 500. If x is greater than or equal to 1, the function returns a sorted list of divisors of x in descending order. If x is less than 1, the function returns an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` within the specified range and return a sorted list of divisors of x in descending order if x is greater than or equal to 1. If x is less than 1, it returns an empty list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x within the specified range and returns a sorted list of divisors of x in descending order if x is greater than or equal to 1. If x is less than 1, it returns an empty list.**
