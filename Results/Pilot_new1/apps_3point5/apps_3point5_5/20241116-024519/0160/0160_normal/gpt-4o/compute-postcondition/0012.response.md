Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. The previous values of `divisors` and `i` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains `i` as a divisor of `x`, and the result of `x // i` is added to `divisors`.
Output State: **`divisors` contains `i` as a divisor of `x`, and the result of `x // i` is added to `divisors`**
