According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set. If x is greater than or equal to 1 and x % i == 0, then `divisors` contains both i and x // i as divisors of x where i is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **`divisors` is a set. If x is greater than or equal to 1 and x % (i+1) == 0, then `divisors` contains both i+1 and x // (i+1) as divisors of x where i is 1**
