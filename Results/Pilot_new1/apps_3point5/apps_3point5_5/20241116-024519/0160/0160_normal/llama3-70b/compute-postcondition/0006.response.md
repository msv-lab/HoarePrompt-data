Example Answer:
The `gcd` is updated by calculating the greatest common divisor between the current value of `gcd` and the element in the list `A` at index `i`. The previous value of `gcd` is unknown, and `i` is less than `N + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer greater than 1, K is an integer within the specified range, A is a list of integers obtained from input, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor of the elements in list A, i is less than N + 1.
Output State: **N is an integer greater than 1, K is an integer within the specified range, A is a list of integers obtained from input, gcd is the updated greatest common divisor of the elements in list A, i is less than N + 1**
