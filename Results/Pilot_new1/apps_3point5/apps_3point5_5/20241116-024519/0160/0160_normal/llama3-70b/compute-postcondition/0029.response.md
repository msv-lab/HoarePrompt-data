According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1, `gcd` is calculated based on list A, `max_divisor` is assigned the updated value, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration + 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. If `gcd % i` is 0, then `max_divisor` should be updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`.
3. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` should be updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd` divided by `i`.

State: **N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is updated, i is the next value after the last iteration + 2**
