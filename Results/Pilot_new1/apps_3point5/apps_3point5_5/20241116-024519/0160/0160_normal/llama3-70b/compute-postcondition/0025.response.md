Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. The previous value of `max_divisor` is unknown, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration + 1. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, `max_divisor` is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration + 1.
Output State: **N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, `max_divisor` is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration + 1**
