According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value. 
State: **N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration + 1**
