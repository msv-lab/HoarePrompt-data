Postcondition: ***`gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i` are positive integers. If `gcd` is divisible by `i + 1` without any remainder, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i + 1`. Additionally, if `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. In all other cases, no changes are made to the variables.***
