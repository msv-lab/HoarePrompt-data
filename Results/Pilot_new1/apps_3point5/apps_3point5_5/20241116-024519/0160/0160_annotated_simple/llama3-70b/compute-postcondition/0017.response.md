Postcondition: ***`gcd`, `N` are positive integers, `max_divisor` is equal to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. `gcd` is divisible by `i` without any remainder, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated accordingly. The postcondition covers all cases where `gcd` is a positive integer, `N` is greater than or equal to 1, and `max_divisor` is adjusted based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.***
