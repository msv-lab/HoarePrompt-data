The function reads two integers N and K from input, then reads a list of integers A. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A. After that, it iterates through the range from 1 to the square root of gcd to find the maximum divisor of gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor found.
