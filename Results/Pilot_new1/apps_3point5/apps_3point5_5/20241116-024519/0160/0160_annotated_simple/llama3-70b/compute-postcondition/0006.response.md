Example Answer: 
The `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and the second element of list `A` at index `i`. Since `i` is 2, the second element of list `A` is `A[2]`. Therefore, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`. 
Output State: **N is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`, `i` is 2**
