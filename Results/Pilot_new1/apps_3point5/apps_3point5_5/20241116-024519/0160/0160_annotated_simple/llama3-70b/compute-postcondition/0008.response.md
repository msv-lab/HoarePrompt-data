Example Answer:
The `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`, where `i` is 3. The `gcd` is calculated using the `math.gcd()` function. Therefore, the Output State is: N is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`, `i` is 3.
Output State: **N is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the initial `gcd` and `A[2]`, `i` is 3**
