According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd` is a positive integer divisible by `i` without any remainder, `N` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `max_divisor` is adjusted based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `max_divisor` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i` and `gcd`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`gcd`, `N` are positive integers where `gcd` is divisible by `i + 1` without any remainder. `max_divisor` is equal to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i + 1`. If `(i + 1) * (i + 1)` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated accordingly.**
