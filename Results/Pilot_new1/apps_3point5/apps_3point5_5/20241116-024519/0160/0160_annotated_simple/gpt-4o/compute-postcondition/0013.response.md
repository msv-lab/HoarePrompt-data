Postcondition: ***divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x+1. If x is divisible by i, then i and x // i are added to the divisors set. This process covers all possible divisors of x, including the edge cases where i is the smallest positive integer (i = 1) and the largest positive integer less than or equal to x+1.***
