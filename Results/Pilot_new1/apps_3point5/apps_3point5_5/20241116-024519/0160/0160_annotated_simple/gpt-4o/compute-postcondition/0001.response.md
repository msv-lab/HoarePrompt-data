According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range has at least one element. In this case, `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1` should be greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `divisors` is an empty set does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `divisors` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `x` is a positive number.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `x` is a positive number**
