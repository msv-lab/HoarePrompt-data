Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x+1`, the set `divisors` now contains the updated list of divisors of `x` including `i` and `x // i`. 
Output State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x+1**
