According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x. x is a positive number. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be adjusted to the next positive integer less than or equal to x. 
State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x. x is a positive number, i is the next positive integer less than or equal to x**
