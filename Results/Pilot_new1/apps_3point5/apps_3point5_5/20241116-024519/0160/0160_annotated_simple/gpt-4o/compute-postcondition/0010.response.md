According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next positive integer less than or equal to x. 
State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x+1**
