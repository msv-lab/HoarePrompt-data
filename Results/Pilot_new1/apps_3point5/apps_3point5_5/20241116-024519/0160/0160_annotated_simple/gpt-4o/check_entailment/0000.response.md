Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The first function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in a given list. This is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
2. The second function `func_2` correctly finds all the divisors of a given number x and returns them in reverse sorted order. This is important for determining the possible divisors of the elements in A after the operations.
3. Both functions are implemented correctly and fulfill the requirements of the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the program would not work as expected.
