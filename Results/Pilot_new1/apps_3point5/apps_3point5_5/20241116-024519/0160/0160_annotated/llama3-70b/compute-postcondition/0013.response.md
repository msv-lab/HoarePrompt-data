Postcondition: ***If N is greater than 1, `gcd` is updated based on the greatest common divisor calculation for the elements in list A, otherwise `gcd` remains as the first element in list A. `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, `i` is within the range of 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1. The `gcd` is divisible by `i`***
