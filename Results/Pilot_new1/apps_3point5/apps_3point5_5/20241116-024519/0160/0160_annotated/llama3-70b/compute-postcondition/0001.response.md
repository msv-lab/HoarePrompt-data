Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `N` and `K` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers within the specified range, A is a list containing the input values as integers.
Output State: **N and K are integers within the specified range, A is a list containing the input values as integers**
