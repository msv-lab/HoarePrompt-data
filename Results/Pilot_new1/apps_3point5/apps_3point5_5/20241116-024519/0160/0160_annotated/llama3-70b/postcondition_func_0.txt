The function reads input values for N and K, then reads a list of N integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the integers in the list. Next, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd by iterating through a range and updating the max_divisor accordingly. Finally, it prints the max_divisor. The function does not return any value, it only prints the max_divisor.
