Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and `x`. `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then both `i` and `x // i` are added to `divisors`. If `x` is not a positive integer, the loop does not execute and `divisors` remains an empty set.**
