Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is 1, the set `divisors` now contains 1 as one of its elements. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x` including 1, where `x` is a positive integer; `i` is 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x` including 1, where `x` is a positive integer; `i` is 1**
