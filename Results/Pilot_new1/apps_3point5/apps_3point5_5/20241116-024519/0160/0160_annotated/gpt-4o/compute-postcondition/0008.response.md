Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, which is 2, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, and `x`, after this operation, `divisors` will also contain the result of `x // i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, and `x // 2`; `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, and `x // 2`; `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2**
