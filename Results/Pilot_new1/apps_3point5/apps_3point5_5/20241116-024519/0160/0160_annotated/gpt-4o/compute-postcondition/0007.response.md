Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, which contains all the divisors of `x`. Since `i` is 2 and `x` is a positive integer, the set `divisors` now includes 2 as one of the divisors of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, and `x`; `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, and `x`; `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2**
