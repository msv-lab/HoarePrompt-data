According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is a positive integer. Since `divisors` is an empty set before the loop starts, it needs to be adjusted to include the condition that `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 1.
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
