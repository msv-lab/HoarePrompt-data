Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion of integers to their word representation based on the given conditions. It considers numbers between 0 and 9, numbers between 11 and 19, and numbers between 10 and 99. The code covers all scenarios within the specified range of input values and provides the correct word representation for each case. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected and provides the correct output for all possible inputs.
