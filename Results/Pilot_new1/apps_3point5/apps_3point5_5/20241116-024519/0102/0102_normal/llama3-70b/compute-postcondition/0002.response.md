Example Answer:
The list `tens` is assigned values representing the tens place in English words. The variable `s` is an integer between 0 and 99, so it does not change based on the assignment of `tens`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99**
