Example Answer:
The value of `s` is used to index the `teens` list after subtracting 10 from it. Since `s` is less than 20, it falls within the range of the `teens` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 10 <= s <= 99 and the value of `s` is less than 20.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 10 <= s <= 99 and the value of `s` is less than 20**
