Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `s` can range from 0 to 99 based on the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99**
