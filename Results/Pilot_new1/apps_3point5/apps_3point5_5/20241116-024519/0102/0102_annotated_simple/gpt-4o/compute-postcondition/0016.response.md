Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number 'n' in the teens list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not between 11 and 19, the function handles two cases: if n % 10 == 0, it returns the string representing the tens digit of n; otherwise, it returns the string representation of the number n in words, combining the string representing the tens digit of n with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of n. The postcondition ensures the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer n for all possible scenarios, covering the edge cases and summarizing them concisely.***
