You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today Tavas got his test result as an integer score and he wants to share it with his girlfriend, Nafas.

His phone operating system is Tavdroid, and its keyboard doesn't have any digits! He wants to share his score with Nafas via text, so he has no choice but to send this number using words. [Image] 

He ate coffee mix without water again, so right now he's really messed up and can't think.

Your task is to help him by telling him what to type.


-----Input-----

The first and only line of input contains an integer s (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), Tavas's score. 


-----Output-----

In the first and only line of output, print a single string consisting only from English lowercase letters and hyphens ('-'). Do not use spaces.


-----Examples-----
Input
6

Output
six

Input
99

Output
ninety-nine

Input
20

Output
twenty



-----Note-----

If n % 10 == 0, the program returns the string representing the tens digit of n. Otherwise, the program returns the string representation of the number n in words, consisting of the string representing the tens digit of n concatenated with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of n. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the input values of s, ones, and n, ensuring the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer n.

If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens digit of n. If n % 10 ≠ 0, the function returns the string representation of the number n in words, consisting of the string representing the tens digit of n concatenated with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of n. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the input values of s, ones, and n, ensuring the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer n.

If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number 'n' in the teens list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not between 11 and 19, the function handles two cases: if n % 10 == 0, it returns the string representing the tens digit of n; otherwise, it returns the string representation of the number n in words, combining the string representing the tens digit of n with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of n. The postcondition ensures the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer n for all possible scenarios, covering the edge cases and summarizing them concisely.

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
