Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine. If `s` is less than 10, the program prints the element at index `s` from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the program prints the element at index `s - 10` from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the program concatenates the element at index `s // 10` from the `tens` list with a hyphen and the element at index `s % 10` from the `ones` list, unless `s % 10` is 0, in which case only the element at index `s // 10` from the `tens` list is printed.***
