Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and `tens` is a list of strings representing tens digits from 0 to 90. The value of `n` is not between 11 and 19. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representing the tens digit of the integer 'n' from the 'tens' list. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the tens and ones digits of the integer `n` separated by a hyphen. The program handles all scenarios within the specified range of `n`, ensuring the correct representation of the tens and ones digits, including edge cases such as n being the minimum (10) and maximum (99) values.***
