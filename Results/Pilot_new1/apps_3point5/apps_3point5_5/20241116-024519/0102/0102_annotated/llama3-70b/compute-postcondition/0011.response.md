Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 10 <= s <= 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9; `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers. If s is less than 20, the string at index s - 10 in the `teens` list is printed. If s is between 20 and 99, the string representation of s is printed based on the `ones` and `tens` lists. The program handles all edge cases and correctly prints the corresponding string representation of the input integer s.***
