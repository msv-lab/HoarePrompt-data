Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist` and prints it. The values of `max_dist` and `min_dist` are dependent on the initial state of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`. The output state will depend on the specific values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`.
Output State: **Dependent on the specific values of `pos1`, `posn`, and `n`**
