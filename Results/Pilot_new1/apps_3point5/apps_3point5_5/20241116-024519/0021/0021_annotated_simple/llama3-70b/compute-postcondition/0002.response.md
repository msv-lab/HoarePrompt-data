Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the integer 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, and 1 is guaranteed to be in the list, the index of 1 will always be found. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **n is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
