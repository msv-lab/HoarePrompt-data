Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between these elements by considering the absolute difference between their positions after a single swap. The logic used in the code is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program outputs the correct maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after the swap.
