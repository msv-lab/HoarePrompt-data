Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index` method. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`. The output state is: n is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **n is an input integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`**
