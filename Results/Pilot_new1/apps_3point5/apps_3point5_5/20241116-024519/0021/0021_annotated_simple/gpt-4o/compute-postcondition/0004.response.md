Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`, and n is always equal to the length of list `a`, `max_pos` will always be n-1. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute difference between 0 and n-1. As n is always between 2 and 100, `dist1` will always be between 1 and 99.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`; `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99**
