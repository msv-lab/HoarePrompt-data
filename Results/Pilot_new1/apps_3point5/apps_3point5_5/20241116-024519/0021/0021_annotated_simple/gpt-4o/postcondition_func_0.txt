The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of the numbers 1 and `n` in the list, as well as their distances to the beginning and end of the list. The function prints the maximum distance calculated. The function assumes `n` is between 2 and 100 inclusive, and the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
