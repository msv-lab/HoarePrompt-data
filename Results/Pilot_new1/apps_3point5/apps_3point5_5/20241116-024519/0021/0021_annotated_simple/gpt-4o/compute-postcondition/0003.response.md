Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, so the index of `n` in list `a` is valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`**
