Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The input is expected to contain `n` integers. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), after execution, the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive)**
