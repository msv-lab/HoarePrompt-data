The function accepts user input for an integer n and a list of n distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, and prints the maximum of these two distances. The function assumes n is between 2 and 100 and that the list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. It does not explicitly return any value but performs the described calculations and prints the result.
