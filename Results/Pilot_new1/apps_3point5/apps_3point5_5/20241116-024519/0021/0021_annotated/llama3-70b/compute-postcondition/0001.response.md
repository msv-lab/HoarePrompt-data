Example Answer:
The list `a` is reassigned the values obtained by splitting the input and converting them to integers using `map`. The input is expected to contain `n` integers, and since `n` is between 2 and 100, the list `a` will contain `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n**
