Example Answer:
`min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 and `n` minus 2. The values of `pos1` and `posn` are known, so we can calculate the result. If `pos1` is 0 and `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`, then `pos1 - posn` will be negative. Therefore, the absolute difference is `posn - pos1`. If `posn` is greater than `pos1`, then the minimum distance will be `posn - pos1 - 1`, otherwise, it will be `pos1 - posn - 1`. The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list a, and `min_dist` is the calculated minimum distance.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list a, and `min_dist` is the calculated minimum distance**
