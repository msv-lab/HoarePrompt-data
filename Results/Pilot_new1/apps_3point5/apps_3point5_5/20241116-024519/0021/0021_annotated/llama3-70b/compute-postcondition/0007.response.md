The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates under the constraints that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value, but it performs a specific operation based on the input parameters `n` and `a`.
