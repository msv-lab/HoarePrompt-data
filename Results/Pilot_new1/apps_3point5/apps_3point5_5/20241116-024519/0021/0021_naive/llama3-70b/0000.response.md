Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n) in the array. It then calculates the maximum possible distance between these elements by considering the absolute difference between their positions and the length of the array. The logic of swapping elements to maximize the distance is also implemented correctly. 
For all the given examples and potential cases, the program produces the correct output by following the problem description.
