Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, the minimum distance between these positions, and prints the maximum of these two distances. The function assumes `n` is between 2 and 100, and the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. **
