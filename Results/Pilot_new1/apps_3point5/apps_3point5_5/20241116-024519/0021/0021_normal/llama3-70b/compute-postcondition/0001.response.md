Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values inputted by the user after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`**
