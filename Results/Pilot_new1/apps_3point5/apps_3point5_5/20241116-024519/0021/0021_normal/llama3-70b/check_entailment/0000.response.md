Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- It then finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (`n`) in the list.
- It calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list and the minimum distance between these positions.
- Finally, it prints the maximum of these two distances as the output.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
