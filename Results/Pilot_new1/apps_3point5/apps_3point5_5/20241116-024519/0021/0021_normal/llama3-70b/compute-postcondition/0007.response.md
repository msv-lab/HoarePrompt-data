The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly assumes that the precondition is met, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function operates based on this precondition and does not return any explicit value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to work with the list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` under the precondition that `n` is between 2 and 100.
