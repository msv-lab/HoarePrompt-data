Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The input string is expected to have `n` integers separated by spaces. Since the initial state mentions that `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, and each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive)**
