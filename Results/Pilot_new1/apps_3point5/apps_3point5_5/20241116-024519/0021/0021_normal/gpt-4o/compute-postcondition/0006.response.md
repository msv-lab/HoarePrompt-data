Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`. The previous values of `min_pos` are known, so we can calculate `dist3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`**
