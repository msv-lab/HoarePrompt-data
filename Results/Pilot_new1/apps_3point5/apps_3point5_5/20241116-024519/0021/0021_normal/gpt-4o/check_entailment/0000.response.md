Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description. 

For example, if the input is:
5
4 5 1 3 2

The code will output 2, but the correct output should be 3. This is because the code calculates the distance of each element from the ends, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping elements to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. In this case, swapping elements 1 and 2 will result in a maximum distance of 3.
