Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, and `n` is the length of the list, the maximum index is `n-1`. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`. The initial state variables `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`**
