Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input as a whole line, which is suitable for handling very large integers.
2. The program correctly removes leading zeroes from both integers.
3. It compares the lengths of the integers first and prints the appropriate symbol if they are not equal in length.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the integers directly and prints the appropriate symbol.
5. The program covers all cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
