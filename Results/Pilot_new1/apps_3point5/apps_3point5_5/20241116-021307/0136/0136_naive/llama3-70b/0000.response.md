Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes.
- It then compares the two numbers as strings and prints the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", or "=") based on the comparison.
- The logic is correct and handles the comparison of very large integers efficiently. 
- The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and works as expected for all inputs.
