Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the split input values, `a` is '0' with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0'. If `b` is falsy, then `b` is set to '0'. If `a` is a falsy value, then `a` is also set to '0'. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`. The value of `a` is less than the value of `b`.***
