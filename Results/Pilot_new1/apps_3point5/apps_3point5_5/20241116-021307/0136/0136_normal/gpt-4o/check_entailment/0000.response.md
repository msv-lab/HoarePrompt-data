Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input values are not numeric or where one or both values are empty strings, as mentioned in the problem description. This means that the code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. Additionally, the code uses `input = sys.stdin.read` twice which is not necessary and can lead to confusion.
