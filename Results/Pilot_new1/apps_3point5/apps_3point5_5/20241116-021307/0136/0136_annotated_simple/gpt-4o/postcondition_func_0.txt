The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. It then prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. The function handles cases where `a` or `b` are empty strings or evaluate to False. However, the function does not return the sum of `a` and `b` as the annotations suggest.
