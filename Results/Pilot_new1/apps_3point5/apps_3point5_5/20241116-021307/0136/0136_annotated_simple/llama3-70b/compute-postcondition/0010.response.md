Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is the input value without leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'. This encompasses all scenarios for the comparison between `a` and `b`.***
