Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. `a` is not equal to `b` in all cases, and the program correctly handles the comparison between `a` and `b` for all non-negative integer values represented as strings with no leading zeros.***
