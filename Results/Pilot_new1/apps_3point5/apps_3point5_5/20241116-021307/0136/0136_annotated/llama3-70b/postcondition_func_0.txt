The function takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, represented as strings, compares them, and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The function correctly handles the comparison between `a` and `b` for all non-negative integer values represented as strings with no leading zeros.
