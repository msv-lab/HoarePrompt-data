Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string and leading zeros are removed using `lstrip('0')`. The variable `a` is updated to store the input without leading zeros. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
