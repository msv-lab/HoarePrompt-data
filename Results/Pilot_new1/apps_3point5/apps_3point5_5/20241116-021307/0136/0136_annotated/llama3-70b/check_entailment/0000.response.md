Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, represented as strings, compares them, and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b', '>', if `a` is greater than `b', and '=' if `a` is equal to `b'. The code also handles leading zeroes by stripping them before comparison, as mentioned in the problem description. The annotations provide additional clarity on what the code does and confirms that the code handles all non-negative integer values represented as strings with no leading zeros. Since there are no cases mentioned in the problem description or examples provided where the code would not work as expected, the code can be considered correct.
