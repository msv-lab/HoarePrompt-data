Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integer values as strings, removes leading zeros, compares them based on their lengths and integer representations, and prints the corresponding symbol ('<', '>', '=') as specified in the problem description. The code annotations also confirm that the program covers all possible cases where the inputs could differ in terms of lengths and integer values. Additionally, the annotations provide a clear explanation of the logic behind the comparisons made in the code. Since the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, it can be considered correct.
