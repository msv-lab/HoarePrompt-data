Example Answer:
The input is split into a list called `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are stored as strings in the list `data`. The values of `a` and `b` are not directly changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
