Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integer values as strings, compares them based on their lengths and integer representations, and prints '<' if the first value is less than the second, '>', if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If the first value evaluates to False, it is assigned '0'. If the second value evaluates to False, it is also assigned '0'. The comparison covers scenarios where the lengths and integer values of the two inputs differ. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
