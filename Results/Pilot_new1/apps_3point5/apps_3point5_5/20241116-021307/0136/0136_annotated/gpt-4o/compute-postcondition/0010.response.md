Output State: **`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` evaluates to False, then `a` is assigned the string '0'. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `b` is False, it is assigned the string '0'. The length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.**
