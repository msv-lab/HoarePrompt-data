Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` with leading zeros stripped. Since `b` is represented as a string, the leading zeros are removed. The initial state of `a` and `b` is not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
