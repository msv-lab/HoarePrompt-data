Correctness: **False**

The provided code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input numbers and prints the result. However, it does not actually follow the problem description. The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x. The code does not perform any operations to modify the sides of the triangle to reach the desired length.

An example where the code does not work correctly:
Input: 6 3
Expected Output: 4
Actual Output (from the code): 3

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect. The annotations did not influence the reasoning as they only describe what the code currently does, which is not in line with the problem description.
