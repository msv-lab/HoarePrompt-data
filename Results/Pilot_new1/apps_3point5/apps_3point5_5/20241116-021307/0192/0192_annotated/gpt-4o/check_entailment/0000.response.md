Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x. The formula used in the code, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, accurately reflects the process of reducing the side lengths of the triangle until they are all equal to y. The provided examples in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases. The annotations also provide a clear summary of what the function does, which aligns with the problem description.
