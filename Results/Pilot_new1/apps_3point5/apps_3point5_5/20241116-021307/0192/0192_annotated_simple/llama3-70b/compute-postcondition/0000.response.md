Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts input and splits it based on spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split part into an integer. Since the input values are integers and satisfy the precondition, the values of `x` and `y` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input**
