Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between x and y and prints it, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x. This logic is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
