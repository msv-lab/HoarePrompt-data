The function `func` reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, calculates the result of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, and prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly requires the user to input two integers separated by a space. There are no return values from the function. The code assumes that `x` and `y` are integers with the constraint that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.
