According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` is truthy. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, and `b` is truthy. To ensure the loop executes one more time, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, `b` is truthy**
