Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated as the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same.
Output State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, no change in the state of the variables.**
