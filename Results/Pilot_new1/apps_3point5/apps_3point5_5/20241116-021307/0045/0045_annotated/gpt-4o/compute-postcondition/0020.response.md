Postcondition: ***No change in the state of the variables, `k` is greater than 1. If remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The program handles the edge case where remainder is 0 and breaks out of the loop, ensuring that the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
