Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input of n and k.
2. It then checks if n is less than k, in which case it prints -1, which is correct according to the problem description.
3. It then creates a sequence of k numbers such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximized.
4. The program then prints the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise it prints -1.
5. The logic of the program seems correct and it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
