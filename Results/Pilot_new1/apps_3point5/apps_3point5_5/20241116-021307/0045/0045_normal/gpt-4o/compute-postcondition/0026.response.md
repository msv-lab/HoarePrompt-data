The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `min_sum`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there are no changes to the values of the variables.

Case_2: The function returns a list `sequence` containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, either return -1 or a list of elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`.
