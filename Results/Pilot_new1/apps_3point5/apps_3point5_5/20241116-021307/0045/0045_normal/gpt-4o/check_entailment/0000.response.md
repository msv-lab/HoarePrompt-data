Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
- The function `func_1` calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers and checks if it is greater than `n`. If it is, the function returns -1.
- If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function calculates the multiples of `d` starting from `d` and constructs a list `sequence` containing these elements. It then adjusts the elements to ensure the sum is equal to `n`.
- The code returns the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise it returns -1.
- The function seems to handle all potential cases as per the problem description. The code is correct as it follows the problem description for every possible scenario.
