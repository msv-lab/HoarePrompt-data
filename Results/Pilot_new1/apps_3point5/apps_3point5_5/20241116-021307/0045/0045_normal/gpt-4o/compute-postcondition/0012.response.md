Output State: **`sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is `k`, `remainder` is equal to 0 if it was before, and the loop breaks if `remainder` is 0. `remainder` is decremented by 1.**
