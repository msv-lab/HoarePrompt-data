According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, the range depends on `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2. `d` is the starting value of the multiples. `i` is -1 and `remainder` is -1. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The element at index `i` in `sequence` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `k` remains greater than or equal to 2, `i` should be adjusted to `k - 2`.
State: **`sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, the range depends on `k`, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is k - 2, `remainder` is -1**
