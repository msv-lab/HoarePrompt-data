According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k`, so `i` will be 0 at the next iteration. The loop breaks if `remainder` is 0, and `remainder` is decremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `remainder` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is 0, `remainder` is 1**
