Example Answer:
The value of `min_sum` is calculated by multiplying `k` with `k+1` and then dividing by 2. Since `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^10, the value of `min_sum` will be the sum of the first `k` positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers**
