Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum`. The output state depends on the values of `min_sum`, `n`, and `d`.
Output State: **Depends on the values of `min_sum`, `n`, and `d`**
