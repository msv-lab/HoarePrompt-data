The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. After executing the function body, the program returns the smaller value between n and k if they are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), or their greatest common divisor if they are not coprime. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the smaller value between them if they are coprime, or their greatest common divisor if they are not coprime.
