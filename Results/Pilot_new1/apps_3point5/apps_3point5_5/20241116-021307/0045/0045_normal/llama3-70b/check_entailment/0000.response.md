Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the total sum and the length of the sequence to be generated.
- It then checks if `n` is less than `k`, in which case it prints -1 as no such sequence is possible.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it proceeds to generate the sequence by iterating from 1 to `k` and adding the numbers to the sequence while decrementing `n`.
- The code correctly handles the case where there is no possible sequence by checking the length of the generated sequence.
- Finally, it prints the resulting sequence if it is valid.

The code follows the problem description for all cases and produces the expected output.
