Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the calculations. `a` is assigned the previous value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Since `b` is truthy, the calculations proceed. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations**
