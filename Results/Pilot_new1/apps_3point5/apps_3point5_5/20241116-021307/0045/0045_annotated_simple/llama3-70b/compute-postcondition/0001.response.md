According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `b` is true. Since the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `b` will evaluate to true for the next iteration.

Since `b` is the condition for the while loop, we need to focus on adjusting the state of variables related to `b`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted in a way that `b` will still evaluate to true for the next iteration. No specific adjustments to `n` and `k` are needed unless they are directly related to the condition `b`.

State: **No specific adjustments to `n` and `k` are needed unless they are directly related to the condition `b`, ensure that `b` remains true for the next iteration**
