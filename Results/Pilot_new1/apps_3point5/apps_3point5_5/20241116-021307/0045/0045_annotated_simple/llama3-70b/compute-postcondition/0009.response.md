Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. The function performs calculations on the variables `a` and `b` using a while loop until `b` becomes 0. If `b` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` and `b` are updated based on the calculations. The function then returns the final value of variable `a` after the calculations.**
