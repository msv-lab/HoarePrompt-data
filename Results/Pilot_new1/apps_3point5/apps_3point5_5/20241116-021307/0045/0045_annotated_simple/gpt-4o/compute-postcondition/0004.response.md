Example Answer: 
The value of `d` is assigned the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`. Since the variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are not affected by this operation, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1**
