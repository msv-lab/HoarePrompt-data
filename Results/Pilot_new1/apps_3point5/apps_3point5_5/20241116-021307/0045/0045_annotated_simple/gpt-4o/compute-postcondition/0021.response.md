Example Answer:
The value of the sequence at index i is incremented by 1, and the value of i is decremented by 1. If the remainder after the increment operation is 0, the loop or if statement is exited. All other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If the remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If the remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.**
