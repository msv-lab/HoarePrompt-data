The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, in Case 1, if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. In Case 2, the program returns the updated sequence list after incrementing values starting from index k-1 until the remainder becomes 0. If k is greater than n or `min_sum`, the function returns -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions mentioned above, either return -1 or the updated sequence list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and k, and based on certain conditions, returns either -1 or the updated sequence list.**
