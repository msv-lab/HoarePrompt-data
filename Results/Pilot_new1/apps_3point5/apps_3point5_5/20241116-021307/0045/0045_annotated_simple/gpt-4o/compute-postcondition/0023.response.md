According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, all variables remain the same, except the sequence at index `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` is decremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i - 1` and the sequence at index `i - 1` should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i-1 is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 2**
