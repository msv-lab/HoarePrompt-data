Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum sum that can be achieved with k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. If the minimum sum is greater than n, the program returns -1 as there is no possible sequence in that case.
3. The program then calculates the quotient d and remainder when n is divided by the minimum sum.
4. It then constructs a sequence of k positive numbers by multiplying each index with d and adding 1 to the elements from index k-1 until the remainder becomes 0.
5. The program returns the resulting sequence.
6. The program follows the problem description and outputs a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.
