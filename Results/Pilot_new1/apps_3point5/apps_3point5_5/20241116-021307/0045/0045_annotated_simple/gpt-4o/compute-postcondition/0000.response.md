Example Answer:
`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, where `k` is a positive integer. The value of `min_sum` is calculated based on the value of `k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` will be a positive integer as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is a positive integer.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is a positive integer**
