Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The loop or if statement will exit if the remainder becomes 0. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.**
