Example Answer:
The list `b` is assigned the values obtained by mapping each input value to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
