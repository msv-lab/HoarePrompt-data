Example Answer:
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. The value of `r` is between 1 and 1000, and the value of `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, which is a positive integer. Therefore, `remaining_bourles` will be between 0 and the minimum value of the list `s`. Other variables are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of list `b`, `max_shares` is the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is between 0 and the minimum value of the list `s`.**
