Example Answer:
`min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value of the list `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`**
