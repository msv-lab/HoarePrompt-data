According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[i]`, `i` is 2, `m` is greater than 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be updated to 3.
- If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` should be increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, then `shares` should be reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop or if statement should be exited.

State: **`shares` is 0, `r` is updated based on the value of `b[3]`, `i` is 3, `m` is greater than 0**
